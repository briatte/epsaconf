2021	0381	34	Campaign Contributions and Legislative Behaviour: Evidence from U.S. Congress	In this study, I investigate the relationship between campaign contributions and legislative behavior of members of U.S. Congress (MCs) between 1980 and 2016. In the last four decades, political donations have become increasingly concentrated and economic inequality has reached the highest level of Western democracies. Contrary to expectations of a strong impact of money in politics, the literature has generally found mixed results for campaign contributions. In this sense, I analyze the relationship between the concentration of donations and three legislative activities of MCs: sponsorship of bills, speechmaking on the floor and witness appearances before committees. I find that the concentration of donations negatively correlates with all three endeavours. The interpretation of this result is that a very skewed structure of political funds makes a legislator more dependent from a relatively smaller number of donors and thus less responsive to the interests of voters. Overall, these findings represent the first empirical assessment of negative agenda power of interest groups and individuals giving large donations. Moreover, for bills the negative correlation is stronger for topics related to redistribution, especially health and housing policy proposals. This complex mechanism of influence of campaign contributions could have ultimately limited Congressional discussion of issues related to economic inequality. The results of this study show that the current system of campaign contributions distorts MCs’ incentives for the representation of their constituencies.

2021	0367	115	Government duration and conflict resolution mechanisms	Government duration is an extensively researched topic in political science. According to a well-known theoretical perspective (the ‘attributes approach’), the longevity of cabinets is determined by the same – legislative- or executive-level – factors that typically explain their formation (e.g. government size and the distribution of ideological preferences in the parliament and in the cabinet) (Strøm 1985). Following another renowned perspective (the ‘events approach’), cabinet duration is primarily affected by a set of ‘shocks’ that occur during the tenure and may perturb the equilibrium reached at the time of government formation (Browne, Frendreis & Gleiber 1984, 1986). These two approaches have been fruitfully combined into a ‘unified’ account of government survival (King et al. 1990; Warwick 1994). In this literature, very limited attention has been paid to the role of institutions such as the conflict resolution mechanisms employed by coalition parties in most multi-party governments. The comparative research on coalition governance has emphasized the crucial task these mechanisms perform in mitigating intra-coalition divergence and allowing coalition members to make joint policy (Strøm, Müller & Bergman 2008; Martin & Vanberg 2011; Carrol & Cox 2012). In this paper we assess how government survival in parliamentary democracies can be affected by the use of long-established institutional instruments designed to help coalition partners to govern together. To this purpose, we use data on the use of coalition governance instruments covering Western European democracies since the end of the Second World War.	Comparative Politics
2021	0335	615	Legislative Scrutiny in Coalition Governments	Legislators have a strong incentive to belong, control and head parliamentary committees. Committees are important venues for legislative scrutiny and are therefore central to understand the strategic interactions among governmental parties. Committee chairs are particularly influential in most parliaments. Why then is the distribution of committee chairs among the coalition partners uneven? And how does it reflect the conflict structure of coalitional decisison-making? Using newly codded data from Portugal and Sweden I show that coalition partners create conditions to scrutinize each other by strategically placing committee chairs in portfolios/issues of particular importance to the party. This provides credibility to the threat to scrutinize policies introduced by the coalition partner. It is mostly the smaller coalition partner(s) which rely on this mechanism.

2021	0351	123	Party Systems and Parliamentarianism	This paper offers an explanation for the long-run development of parliamentarianism in Western Europe. In many polities, parliamentarianism is what renders other institutions such as suffrage and electoral rules meaningful. However, unlike other institutions, parliamentarianism has been given scant attention in its own right. Defined as government responsibility to parliament only, parliamentarianism was the outcome of serious struggles among actors, particularly political parties and heads of state. In this paper, I argue that the development of parliamentarianism depended on party-system features such as institutionalization, fragmentation, volatility, and competitiveness because the development of party systems changed interactions among parties. These changes facilitated parliamentary practices while simultaneously shrinking the maneuvering room of (unelected) heads of state. The propositions are tested against nine century-long country histories, using panel-data techniques on a newly compiled data set. The paper is thus the first to offer explanations of European parliamentarianism in its own right.	Comparative Politics
2021	0382	431	A new approach to measure economic competitiveness on a subnational level.	Economic competitiveness is at the core of the field of political economy. Whether actors face competition from imports or seek to export products or services abroad allows us to better understand support for trade liberalisation. But arguments referring to the economic competitiveness of districts are widespread in the field of International Political Economy, beyond trade and also beyond this field, for example in theories of economic voting. However, thus far, we lack a convincing measure of economic competitiveness, particularly on a subnational level. In this measurement paper, we propose two measures of economic competitiveness, namely i) revealed comparative advantage measure, and ii) a trade ration measure. In combination with labour survey from more than 30 countries across the world, we demonstrate the applicability of our measure and provide empirical applications in the realm of productivity and voting which lend face credibility to our approach.

2021	0352	258	Global Aspects of Deservingness: How international trade risks and migration flows affect pension deservingness perception in Brazil	Access to social policy benefits is highly conflictual, especially in contexts of tight budgets and restrained opportunities in global credit markets. Previous research has identified a set of factors determining the deservingness to access welfare goods from the viewpoint of public opinion, among which nationality in the form of in/out-group dynamics plays a role. Out-group status can, however, also be determined through labor market status (formal/informal), party identity or other attitudes on, e. g., globalization or within-country migration. A more differentiating view on control, reciprocity and identity taking into account globalization effects, has, so far, been neglected in academic research. In this paper, I look at control, reciprocity and identity while keeping need constant in the middle-income country context of Brazil. I make use of a Conjoint experiment that was conducted as part of a larger, original, sub-national survey in 2019. Respondents received fictional, randomly assembled profiles of beneficiaries and were asked to indicate whom of the two profiles they would give access to a pension. Preliminary results show that especially globalization losers (individuals that lost their job to offshoring) are deemed deserving to a pension. Reciprocity does not seem to play a big role in this context since formal workers are perceived as less deserving, but nationality does determine access.

2021	0368	168	The Conditional Arm of the Law. The Effect of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention on Foreign Direct Investment	Corporate criminal regulations are often criticized for increasing political risk to firms and deterring their foreign investment. Yet, the conditions under which this occurs are understudied. This paper studies the effect of corporate criminal policies home states adopted with the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention on their firms' outward investment. It argues that their effect on investment depends on the level of corruption of the host economy. The effect is null in clean countries. Where corruption is mild, anti-bribery laws empower firms: they provide a legal leverage to refuse paying costly bribes. The effect on investment is positive. Where corruption is endemic, instead, these policies deter investment: they expose firms to the risk of prosecution without providing any effective leverage. The effect is negative. Multilevel logit models test the argument, explaining investment decisions of 3871 individual firms between 2006 and 2011. Companies from signatories have a 40% higher probability of investing in mildly corrupt economies than those from non-signatories, which plummets to -50% in extremely corrupt countries. Difference-in-differences models of country-dyad investment flows corroborate this finding. Results show that anti-bribery policies pull firms away from extremely corrupt economies, which are left exposed to companies without anti-corruption standards. This informs a re-evaluation of anti-bribery policies.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0336	117	Who Rebels on Trade Policy? Analyzing Voting Patterns of Legislators	Legislators play a key role in determining trade policy. In many countries, parliaments have to authorize their government to commence a trade negotiation and in most countries, parliaments must ratify any agreement before it enters into force. Unsurprisingly, most trade agreements are ratified along party lines but in some instances, defectors from the government prevent an agreement from entering into force. What drives these rebels? In this paper, I argue that material interests of the constituencies of lawmakers are the main reason for them to rebel from the party line. The more a legislator’s constituents stand to lose economically from an agreement, the more likely is this legislator to defect from her party if her party is in favor of the agreement and vice versa for legislators from districts that stand to benefit from trade liberalization. To test this hypothesis, I analyze 11,636 votes from twelve countries on the ratification of 53 different trade agreements. The results support the hypothesis and also demonstrate that the effect of the material interest on legislators' likelihood to rebel depends on the scope and depth of the trade agreement. This paper has implications for research on trade policy-making, representation, and legislator behavior.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0369	109	The Economic Legacy of Early Democracy	Do democratic institutions promote long-run development? This paper documents that a precolonial version of democracy was conducive to long-run development in the contemporary developing world. However, these early democratic institutions only promoted development where European colonizers lacked the power to destroy them. While most colonial power was centered around the capital, it diminished in concentric circles into the hinterlands. The limited colonial power outside the capital made it difficult for the Europeans to destroy early democracy, and therefore, it often persisted in the hinterlands. Over time, early democracy laid the foundation for long-run development because societal actors were able to sanction rulers who failed to deliver public goods. Combining ethnographic data on early democracy with fine-grained data on local development, I document an economic legacy of early democracy in the hinterlands and present evidence for my proposed mechanism.

2021	0383	322	Neighborhood Social Ties and Compliance among the Poor	An extensive literature on political participation and social extraction suggests that peers, family members, and local authorities greatly influence the poor’s willingness to participate in political actions and community projects. Other literature on social networks suggests that individuals participate more when they reside in close-knit communities. We bring these literatures together. Recognizing that the poor do not uniformly reside in socially dense communities, we examine the extent to which close social ties influence the likelihood that poor individuals respond to the calls made by neighbors and local authorities to contribute to community goods. To do so, we employ a conjoint experiment and observational data from an original survey of over 23,000 respondents, fielded in more than 1200 communities in Kenya, Zambia, and Malawi. We find that the poor are more likely to express a willingness to contribute to a school or a burial fund, or to support a specific candidate, when asked by neighbors and village heads, and that they are more likely to do so in communities with strong social ties. Moreover, we find support for community monitoring and bandwagoning as two underlying mechanisms. Our findings suggest that poor individuals are more responsive to people from their community, and leaders embedded in their community networks, because they fear social sanctions by members of the community or expect rewards for compliance. This implies that distant, even if more powerful, leaders may have less influence over the poor when they lack the connections to the local communities.

The literature on the effect of political events on markets is attentive to the influence ofelections and institutional appointments. Less investigated is the economic impact of events related to alternative political leaders, e.g. religious authorities. This paper builds on new research on unconventional leadership and spiritual officials, focusing on the case of the Pope. We study the material implications of the utmost relevant papal communications – the encyclicals – for stakeholders associated with public issues addressed in these documents. We conjecture that investors are sensitive to Popes’ communications that clearly signal a policy approach directed at the scope of their economic activities. However, Popes have ideological leanings that make them more or less sympathetic to the use of markets to solve public issues. We expect that if a Pope leans towards a market-based approach to a specific issue, the most exposed sectors may becheerful of a papal communication and materially benefit through stock returns. Vice versa, if a Pope is skeptical of market approaches, investors may see negative returns after the papal announcement. We propose an event study that traces the impact of Pope Francis’s 2015 climate encyclical on the stocks of the global energy industry. We show that this encyclical by Francis, who is viewed as an opponent of profit-driven solutions and distinctly criticized market-based climate policy arrangements, caused renewable energy companies to lose stock value after publication. We also demonstrate that this effect is concentrated among US firms as a result of the partisan framing of the encyclical.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0337	49	Dividends of Power: The Governance of Contemporary Resource Management	Do patron–client networks impeded economic development and lead to political disatisfaction among those left behind areas or do they facilitate faster, more equitable regional growth and greater satisfaction among residents? In this article, I argue that local patron–client networks leads to more unequal distribution of resources, greater variation in economic growth, and more within-region hostility to politics. I show that while patronage networks improve economic performance of favoured locations because they leave unfavoured locations behind, they also increase local animosities raising feelings of 'relative deprivation'. I test this claim by examining patronage networks amongst local board members and project funding recipients in the Rocky Mountain river basin region in Canada. Using an original regional-district–level panel data set between 2000 and 2020 and text analysis that identified patronage ties, I show that while areas with greater informal ties deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without, left behind regions also show greater disatisfaction with local politics.

2021	0354	144	Determinants of Progressive Parties’ Redistributive Politics - An Exploration	Support bases of left-wing and some liberal (‘progressive’) parties increasingly consist of wealthier voters. This presents a challenge. Though these progressive parties continue to espouse redistributive goals, a decrease in support from low-income voters implies that redistribution will be harder to achieve because parties’ positions on redistribution have been linked to the composition of their support bases. In representative democracies, it is commonly accepted that parties are meant to serve as voters’ representatives in government and that their policies ought to reflect voters’ preferences. This leads to the main question in this study: are progressive parties’ positions on redistribution responsive to the changes in the composition of their support bases? Engaging literature on intra-party politics, representation, political economy, and institutional theories of path-dependence, we use quantitative statistical modeling to examine this question in 27 EEA countries over time (1980-2020). In doing so, we are taking the first step in a larger scholarly agenda aimed at exploring how voter preferences, external institutions, and parties’ appeals to social groups determine parties' positions on redistributive policies and their electoral consequences. Challenging the argument that rational-choice calculations of utility maximization determine parties' behavior, the study introduces other internal and external influences, enhancing our understanding of important democratic practices and the party-voter linkage.

2021	0338	419	Negotiating policy support: Explaining bias in interest group influence on legislative party groups across policy areas	How parties interact with interest groups may matter for the quality of political representation. Legislative party groups regularly get input from numerous interest groups trying to influence the priority and design of policy proposals, but individual party groups are likely to listen more to some groups than others. This creates a bias in interest group influence on individual parties. In this paper, we shed light on what explains such bias in interest group influence on legislative party groups, and test possible party level explanations across different policy areas in Western democracies. Based on theory of parties as rational goal-seeking actors, we hypothesize that bias in interest group influence will decrease when party salience increases because parties will then be more concerned about scaring away voters. It will be especially important for parties to emerge as serious and knowledgeable on the issue. Information provided by different interest groups becomes more valuable to avoid being scrutinized for bad policy proposals. Thus, parties try to find solutions that satisfy different groups without cross-cutting party decisions. The hypothesis is tested by combining the PAIRDEM interest group survey data set with party salience data from the Manifesto Project. Multiple regression analysis controlling for media salience, party size and country fixed effects give some support for the proposed hypothesis. The findings indicate that legislative party groups do seek to balance out different concerns among interest groups on policy areas of high party salience.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0370	556	Closing the gateway to power? When and why parties grant trade unions access to ministerial office	How do trade unions exert political influence? One important channel has been the appointment of trade unionists as government ministers. However, this arrangement relies on political parties as gatekeepers. Our theory argues that the incentives for parties to grant trade unions access to ministerial office have shifted in the postindustrial era. Not only have unions become weaker in many democracies, but electoral dealignment and programmatic change have made trade union support more dispensable for political parties. Under these conditions, even strong unions should be less successful in securing ministerial nominations. We test this hypothesis by combining data on electoral dealignment (election studies) and programmatic change (party manifestos) with a novel data set comprising information on the union background of over 4,000 ministers in 16 West European democracies between 1945 and 2020. Our results deepen our understanding of how socio-economic and political transformations affect not only electoral politics, but also the selection of political elites in postindustrial democracies.

While a growing literature has studied the political implications of house prices and house ownership, much less is known about the political economy of housing in countries dominated by rental markets. Starting from the observation that renting property follows a fundamentally different market experience than owning property, we develop an original argument that highlights that the political implications of rental market exposure reach well beyond pocketbook considerations. Changing rental prices create an imminent source of insecurity, which threatens individuals far beyond the poorest strata of society and may make affected voters susceptible to the promises of anti-system parties. We rely on a novel data source containing unusually detailed information on cost and quality of local rental markets over time in Germany, the country with the highest share of citizens living in rented apartments in the entire European Union. We merge this data by postcode with individual-level panel data. Our analysis is based on a rigorous set of fixed-effects specifications and provides strong empirical evidence for our guiding hypothesis on both the household- and the neighborhood-level.

2021	0355	99	The individual dynamics of gender backlash and far right support	This paper examines the individual dynamics of sexist attitudes and its consequences for support for the far right. The empirical analysis focuses on the case of Spain, which has recently witnessed a strong wave of feminist mobilization followed by the sudden electoral surge of the radical-right party Vox. We use unique panel survey data tracking individual attitudes of sexism and voting behavior yearly during the same period (2017-2020). Sexist attitudes are measured using the modern sexism scale (Swim et al. 1995), which captures the key dimensions of the Spanish far-right discourse regarding gender, i.e. denial of continued discrimination against women, antagonism towards women’s demands, and lack of support for policies designated to help women. Our paper makes three significant contributions. First, the results of mixed growth models show that levels of sexism change in the short term in a way that is compatible with a within-individual backlash effect. Citizens are seemingly reactive to contextual political events in their levels of sexism. Second, we show that sexism is a key predictor of vote choice for the radical right, outweighing in explanatory power all other sociodemographic and attitudinal predictors (including nativism and nationalism) with the exception of left-right self-identification. Finally, we show that the gender gap in radical right support can be accounted for considering sexism. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the existence of individual-level gender backlash effects, and highlight the importance of sexism as a fundamental individual predictor of far right support.

2021	0387	555	We have been left behind, haven't we? Economic status loss, class voting and the populist radical right	A growing body of research attempts to reconcile economic and cultural explanations of populist radical right (PRR) voting by highlighting citizens' resentment against their gradual marginalisation within society. Nonetheless, widespread speculations about the deteriorating relative economic position of PRR voters are not supported by proper empirical evidence. To address this shortage, the present study first provides a theoretical discussion of the electoral consequences of economic status loss by bridging multidisciplinary literature on relative economic inequality and group deprivation; subsequently, it assesses such consequences empirically, by means of a novel measure of economic status loss. Our multilevel analysis on ESS and EU-SILC data on 19 elections (2008-2017) across 9 Western European countries demonstrates that PRR parties are most successful among social classes facing a collective decrease in economic status – rather than material deprivation per se. More specifically, voters from social classes that have moved farther away from the affluent than from the poor in income terms feature higher chances of voting for PRR parties. This result is robust across several model specifications. Additional analysis reveals that this finding is not driven by any specific electoral alternative, that is neither the left nor the centre-right taken individually. Furthermore, our analysis does not confirm that the experience of material deprivation at the class level affects PRR voting, which is consistent with prior studies. This result is consequential for scholarly debates on the reasons for class PRR alignment and on the electoral repercussions of economic inequalities.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0339	596	'Protect our women': The effects of gendered anti-immigration frames	As populist radical right-wing parties (PRRPs) have gained electoral and political leverage across Europe, it is still contested what explains their increasing acceptability. Parties might try to engage in a variety of strategies to make themselves feel and appear more mainstream without actually changing their policy positions. By framing their most controversial, 'unacceptable' policy positions in more normatively acceptable ways, radical right-wing parties might try to present themselves as a respectable political option, especially for voters traditionally underrepresented in these parties. In this paper, I examine the effects of one particular frame used by the radical right: using women's protection and gender equality to justify anti-immigration claims. I argue that these gendered immigration frames make anti-immigration policies more acceptable. Through survey experiments conducted in Germany and Norway, I find that gendered anti-immigration messages make voters more likely to express anti-immigration preferences and to report voting for the radical right. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how previously unacceptable positions become normalised, and how gender equality rhetoric is used as a powerful legitimising device to this end.

2021	0384	247	The Social Status Hierarchy and Its Cultural and Economic Determinants	This paper applies a conjoint experiment to analyze the cultural and economic sources of social status. The great potential of the concept of social status to capture perceptions of decline is now widely recognized in political science. Phenomena like the increasing success of radical right parties have been traced back to a sense of status loss - not being respected and valued by society anymore - among their voters. However, the multidimensional nature of status has not been sufficiently addressed yet, as economic as well as cultural grievances could drive this sense of status loss. This paper addresses this gap by disentangling economic and cultural dimensions of social status, made possible by an innovative conjoint design. The paper proceeds in two steps: First, it examines the separate influence of socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics on the perceived status hierarchy. Does a sense of societal worth depend solely on socioeconomic factors like income, education and occupation? Or do sociocultural factors like gender, race and sexuality also play a role? Second, it takes into account how both dimensions interact in their influence on status perceptions. For example, do cultural gender norms shape the prestige of occupations in a diverging way for men and women? This paper relies on original survey data from Switzerland, a country with a strong radical right party. The embedded conjoint experiment asked respondents to situate fictive people with randomized characteristics on the societal hierarchy. Overall, the paper lays a foundation for understanding perceptions of decline more closely.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0340	272	Are social media campaigns reaching young people? Mobilising the youth vote in the 2019 UK General Elections	Voter registration among young people is significantly lower and they turn out less than older voters. Moreover, they are hard to reach with conventional registration methods such as canvassing and direct mail. As of late there have been large-scale attempts to register and mobilise young voters via social media campaigns on various platforms, both by partisan and non-partisan actors. However, there is a lot of scepticism regarding whether social media campaigns are effective. The experimental literature suggests that the effect of social media ads on persuasion and mobilisation are positive but small (Bond 2012, Hager 2019). In this field experiment, we worked with a non-partisan organisation to test if their social media registration drive on Instagram and Snapchat was effective at registering young people to vote in the 2019 UK General Election. In a large-scale RCT – the first of its kind - we assigned 879 postcode sectors located within 40 parliamentary constituencies to four groups: control, one group that received voter registration video ads. These messages were targeted towards young people aged 18-35 years. We collected voter registration at the polling district level (polling stations can perfectly be matched to postcode sectors) and from official voter registers to test whether social media campaigns targeted towards young people can increase voter registration and turnout.

We exploit individual data from a large survey of British households to study the significant increase in the support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in Great Britain in the aftermath of the financial crisis. We find that voters are more likely to support UKIP when they identify with their community and, at the same time, a larger number of people in their community experience resentment induced by a worsening of their relative income position. These findings shed new light on the key elements of resentment in communities that are left-behind by the pace of economic development.	Comparative Politics
2021	0388	560	The Effect of Compulsory Civic Duty on Turnout	We study the effects of compulsory civic duty on turnout. We take advantage of a natural experiment provided by the organization of Spanish Elections. In Spain there is a lottery to select individuals that will act as electoral administrators on the election day. Being an electoral administrator is compulsory. We study whether acting as an administrator changes turnout in subsequent elections and attitudes about democracy and elections. We find that compulsory civic duty has a strong short-term and positive effect on electoral participation but has no effect on political attitudes. This is consistent with political theories that argue that voting costs are reduced when voting habits have been developed and with psychological theories that argue that habit formation activates behaviors consistent with individuals’ underlying values without necessary changing those values.

2021	0356	81	Poll Workers and the habit of voting	Does direct participation in the electoral process contribute to increase turn out in future electoral contests? In many countries, polling officers are chosen by lot among all registered voters in the precinct. This fact makes it a perfect natural experiment in order to test the effect of random assignment into direct involvement in electoral procedures. Employing real validated turnout data from elections in Catalonia during the 1930s it is possible towe trace real individual-level data on turnoutconstruct an individual-level panel dataset across all elections that took place during the Spanish Second Republic period and examine whether participating in the organization of the elections increased an individual’s propensity to participate. Employing a novel data set of polling officers in 1933 elections, we employ a Difference-in-differences strategy in order to assess whether these individuals were more likely to turn out to vote after their appointment as polling officers. WeOur expectation is that that the appointment of officers should have a positive effect and increase turnout, especially for low-skilled individuals, women and for individuals living in less-politicized environments.

2021	0372	570	The Effect of Vocational Education on Voter Choice	Past literature has shown that university graduates are a distinct electoral block who are more likely to vote for liberal and green parties as compared to other voters. However, there is little scholarly work examining how different educational training systems affect voter choice. Specifically, how does vocational as opposed to higher education affect voter choice? We utilise the 2010 - 2018 rounds of the European Social Survey to examine the effect of vocational education and differing kinds of vocational education in the case of Germany. For this research, Germany is the appropriate case due to vocational training being widespread across all sectors of the economy. We find that the within-group diversity in terms of voter choice of those who undergo vocational training is lower as compared to those who undergo other forms of education. Second, we find that as a group those who undergo vocational training are overall comparatively more likely to vote for the CDU. These findings are significant because the overall demographic composition of an electorate will shape electoral outcomes. Our contribution therefore brings new light on the effect of vocational training on voter choice.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0357	72	The Meaning of Work: a Mediating Link Between Socioeconomic Status and Economic Policy Preferences	Modern capitalist societies are defined by several important socioeconomic cleavages that shape the political arena. Differing political attitudes are commonly related to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the people that hold them. This study argues that a perspective essential to understanding these cleavages and how they relate to political attitude formation is the meaning people attribute to the act of working – what role work plays in their personal lives, how it is manifested in their social relations and why they engage in such an activity in the first place. Using latent class analysis to examine data from the 2017 European Value Survey (EVS 5) regarding 12 European advanced economies, I inductively identify three distinct classes of people who attach different meanings to work: a traditional work ethic class, a post-productivist class, and an intermediate class. I find that attaching different meanings to work is correlated with important labor market cleavages (gender, age, education, occupation, and insider/outsider status) on the one hand, and with economic policy preferences on the other. These findings imply that while socioeconomic status may determine one's economic interests, and that these interests may predict economic policy preferences, another path may exist – socioeconomic status predicts the meaning one attributes to work, and the meaning attached to work predicts economic policy preferences.

Despite the fundamental role of employment for individual’s livelihoods, little attention has been given to how the workplace impacts employees’ political contributions. I use donations of employees and Political Action Committees (PACs) of 12,737 public companies between 2003 and 2018 to show that 16.7 percent of employee donations go to employer-supported politicians. I investigate the dynamic relationship between employee and PAC donations within firm-politician pairs over time and find that employees contribute 17.4% more dollars to company-supported politicians. Firm-employee alignment is stronger on powerful and ideologically moderate legislators with high value for one’s employer. Results from a difference-in-differences design show that high-ranking employees even change the partisanship of their donations in line with their employer, suggesting investment-related rather than ideological motives for alignment. In sum, corporations and the workplace might be even more important in shaping political contributions than previously thought.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0373	287	Does Industrialization Cause Democratization? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the Norwegian and Swiss Industrial Revolution	Prominent theories of the origins of democracy suggests that industrialization was a driving force for democratization in the 19th and early 20th century. While there is some cross-country evidence on such a link, we know little about whether this effect is causal, and what causal mechanisms may mediate this relationship. We utilize two novel datasets to explore how industrialization drives historical democratization. In Norway, 1879 to 1913, we consider whether MPs from industrializing constituencies were more likely to vote for democratic reforms. In Switzerland, 1860-1920, we study whether more rapidly industrializing cantons were more likely to introduce referenda and other instruments of direct democracy. To support a causal interpretation we exploit that Norwegian municipalities and Swiss cantons with a greater geographical potential for hydropower were significantly more likely to industrialize after the invention of hydroelectricity.

2021	0374	382	Does Party-System Fragmentation Affect the Quality of Democracy?	Given their central role in the process of decision making, party-systems are usually expected to affect a number of democratic outcomes. Research on this topic, however, has suffered from problems of endogeneity stemming from the fact that the characteristics of the party system are endogenous to many other dynamics in a polity. We overcome this issue by putting forward an instrument for the number of parties in a system, based on the level of fragmentation added by parties that narrowly make it to parliament. We then test the effect of party-system fragmentation on the quality of democracy, drawing upon a large battery of outcomes. Running against previous literature, we find that a higher number of parties leads to more fractionalized governments, but it has no impact on other democratic outcomes. The null effect persists after using a large number of different model specifications, operationalizations of the treatment variable and subsamples. Our results cast doubt on the normative implications of party-system fragmentation.	Comparative Politics
2021	0358	135	The effect of social influencers on electoral outcomes: Evidence from a natural experiment	Do social influencers affect election outcomes? Through social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, social influencers can reach millions of people turning them into important opinion leaders in their respective societies. However, research on social influencers is scarce and so far largely limited to marketing research. In this paper, I will therefore address this shortcoming in the literature by analyzing the effect of social media influencers on electoral outcomes. Empirically, I will exploit a natural experiment that occurred during the 2019 European election campaign. 6 days before the 2019 EP election, the German social influencer and YouTube comedian Rezo published a video in which he severely attacks the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) that was watched by over 15 million users. I will identify the causal effect of the Rezo video on the election outcome by relying on a differences-in-differences analysis. More specifically, I will compare the vote share for the CDU among postal votes that are typically cast a number of days before the election (control group) and in-person votes (treatment group) since only the latter have been exposed to the video. The results of this study have major implications for our understanding of the relationship between social media, electoral competition and political representation.	Comparative Politics
2021	0342	132	Information and Perceptions of Election Fraud, Judicial Rulings, and Diffuse Political Support	Consciousness of election fraud has been shown to let individuals withdraw support from candidates allegedly involved in manipulation and to depress citizens’ expressed legitimacy of the elected government that stems out of processes which are perceived to be fraudulent. We outline a theory of attitudinal spillover which argues that information about electoral malpractice will lead individuals to extrapolate legitimacy loss even to political institutions that are unrelated to electoral administration. This theory predicts that consciousness about electoral misconduct won’t let individuals merely detach from the institutions linked to misbehavior and the regime that surged out of an illegitimate election process, but turn their backs on the political system as a whole. Second, we examine if within-system corrections like successful court punishments of alleged fraud perpetrators can moderate decays in diffuse system support. We present empirical evidence from a pre-registered online survey experiment conducted in Mexico and Russia as well as causal estimates from statistical matching techniques based on cross-national survey data. Our findings hold important implications for the study of electoral integrity in new democracies as well as electoral autocracies and its consequences for democratic consolidation and regime stability.

2021	0359	76	The Regional Governance of Immigrant Reception: Mercosur before the presence of Venezuelans in South America	Since the 2000s, MERCOSUR, the Southern Common Market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, established different mechanisms supporting the mobility and protection of intraregional migrants, as in the case of the MERCOSUR Residence Agreement. However, the current socio-political collapse of the post-Hugo Chávez regime in Venezuela represented a major challenge to this approach as millions of Venezuelans emigrated to neighbouring countries in the region. In this context, MERCOSUR has faced important pressures to steer governance arrangements that respond to the migration of Venezuelans based on a human rights approach. Against this backdrop, our paper looks into the role of MERCOSUR in the regional governance by asking how and why has (not) the regional organisation reconciled top-down (i.e. nation-states) and bottom-up (i.e. civil society and sub-national governments) approaches to immigrant reception? By looking into Mercosur, the paper contributes to assessing whether and how the regional level works as an adequate regulatory mechanism where states and constellations of non-state actors and networks cooperate in the response to common regional challenges derived from human mobility. Our question is highly relevant as concerted and multilateral responses to migration based on a human rights approach have been, until the recent approval of the 2018 Global Compacts on Migration and Refugees, elusive at a global scale.

2021	0389	380	Humanitarian Concerns and Acceptance of Syrian Refugees in Turkey	Do humanitarian concerns affect the willingness of the host society to host refugees? Evidence from Western democracies suggests they do, but it is not clear whether they also matter in non-Western societies that host most of the refugees. We conceptualize humanitarianism along three dimensions: referent object, domain of applicability, and referent subject. Using data from a conjoint experiment among over 2,300 respondents in Turkey, we examine how information about torture shapes local population attitudes towards Syrian refugees. We find that while support for profiles of torture victims is higher than for profiles of refugees who were not tortured, the substantive effect of information on torture is relatively modest compared to other drivers of public opinion and compared to findings in the West. Nonetheless, information on torture increases support for all refugees regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender, and education--in line with our expectation about humanitarianism. Among the host population, the information that a refugee suffered from torture equally affects all respondents, except for female respondents who are swayed by such information more than male respondents. Finally, the effect of information on torture is similar across different domains of hosting refugees--social, economic, and political. Overall, we conclude that although humanitarian concerns matter, their effect in Turkey is quite modest in line with breadth-depth tradeoff.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0386	299	The Determinants and Implications of Policy Preferences in Response to South-South Forced Migration: Experimental Evidence from Colombia	What determines individuals’ preferences for different policy responses to forced migration, and what does this imply for promoting greater cohesion and reducing inequalities between host communities and refugees? Migration has been central to electoral shifts in many receiving countries, arguably by eroding trust in governments who are perceived to be ineffective. Yet most existing work examining public preferences for forced migration policies has focused on high-income destination contexts—particularly around the European “migration crisis” of 2015. This presents limitations for developing better theoretical and empirical understanding of how migration policy preferences form and change. We address these problems by considering the case of Venezuelan migration to Colombia, currently one of world’s largest and fastest-growing mixed migratory flows. Using an online conjoint survey experiment, to be fielded in Colombia in January-February 2021, we identify Colombians’ preferences for policy “packages” comprising variations in numerical limits, dispersal, access to welfare and labour markets, and return requirements. We also measure features including respondents’ levels of trust in government, perceptions of how many Venezuelans reside in Colombia, personal contact with Venezuelans, and values such as humanitarianism. Our results have implications for how policymakers think about—and act upon—the issue in the future.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0343	658	Refugee Evictions and the Spread of Refugee-Native Clashes: Evidence from Turkey	When does violence break out between refugees and natives in a host nation? Existing research on this topic is mostly focused on advanced industrial Western countries even though most refugees live in the non-Western developing world. We analyze this question with a new data set on native-refugee clashes between 2014 and 2018 in Turkey, which hosts the largest refugee population in the world. Our main finding is that clashes tend to spread and local authorities' response previous clashes is significantly related to the probability of clash diffusion. We present qualitative and quantitative evidence suggesting that potential rioters observe the outcomes of past clashes and adjust their behavior accordingly. When the state concedes to native rioters in one place by evicting refugees, new riots break out elsewhere aiming to provoke the state into sending more refugees away. Our findings imply that coordinating local responses to native-refugee violence may help lower the overall level of violence. More broadly, this research suggests that local authorities play an important role regarding violence between refugees and natives.	Comparative Politics
2021	0422	602	Aid, Blame, and Backlash: The Political Economy of Unpopular Aid	Not all aid is welcome. Aid targeted at minorities or other marginalized groups in recipient countries is a common donor priority but may generate backlash from majority group constituents jealous of the allocation. If politicians are attributed credit for aid that their locality receives, they may also be attributed blame for the locality's unpopular aid. The logic of credit-claiming in aid implies the existence of blame-attribution for unpopular aid. I develop a theory of how blame-attribution and donor-driven incentives to promote aid for vulnerable populations reduce support for incumbent politicians. A case study of Kosovo illustrates the dynamic of political backlash against elected officials who are in power when aid to an unpopular minority is delivered by international actors. I use a natural experiment based on the random timing of the Life in Transition Survey in relation to the start, implementation, and completion of aid projects to identify the political cost of unpopular aid for recipient incumbent politicians. I find that exposure to aid to marginalized groups negatively affects support for local and national governments and increases support for right-wing parties. Donor attempts to help vulnerable populations may lead to backlash that empowers anti-minority parties, making the political landscape of recipient countries more dangerous for the groups they sought to aid.

2021	0406	221	Rewarding Women's Rights in Dictatorships	How can dictatorships signal democratic progress to international audiences? Cross-national research has documented a correlation between democracy, foreign aid, and other international benefits, but we have as yet little understanding of how different policies are received by the international professionals tasked with actually making decisions about development programs. We theorize women's rights as a policy area in which autocrats can signal democracy without risking their political survival, in contrast to other more costly reforms to the electoral sphere. To test our hypotheses, we implement a conjoint survey experiment on an international ``elite' sample of 108 professionals in the development field. Our design allows us to assess how policies related to (a) electoral competition, (b) women's economic rights, and (c) women's political representation influence perceptions of democracy and willingness to provide foreign aid. We find that reforms related to opposition parties have a large impact on perceptions of democracy and on foreign aid provision, but, strikingly, that increasing women's economic rights is also a highly effective signal. Legislative gender quotas exhibit a significant (though smaller) effect on perceived democracy, but do not increase the likelihood of receiving a foreign aid package. Taken together, our findings support the idea that autocrats enjoy considerable leeway in how they may choose to signal democratic progress to international audiences, but that the signaling `power' of gender quotas may be weakening in light of their prevalence in both democracies and dictatorships around the world.

2021	0438	565	'Reversed favoritism'' -- Resolving the puzzle of discriminatory taxation in African agriculture	The political economy literature highlights the redistribution of resources to political support groups -- often along regional or ethnic lines -- as a dominant feature of political systems. Against this assumption, Kasara (2007) documents a puzzling result of discriminatory rent extraction by political leaders from farmers in their ethnic home region.Linking a new database on ethnic and regional affiliation of political leaders to fine-grained survey data, I disentangle ethnic and regional affiliations and show that their intersection explains the phenomenon which I will label in the following ``reversed favoritism.'' More specifically, I provide evidence that agricultural price hikes indeed do not reduce poverty among co-ethnic farmers in the leader birth region. Results indicate that farmers are aware about the unfavorable taxation as they express lower tax support. Yet, leaders seem to act politically rational as they only apply this treatment in regions where they enjoy high trust. An exploratory analysis suggests that the counter-intuitive support of discriminatory policies can be explained by transfers in other arenas, namely development aid.

We quantitatively investigate the explanatory power of main domestic variables (government ideology, prevalence of socialdemocratic culture, political elites' intrinsic commitment to aid) and international factors (political and economic interests, emulation, EU pressure), which represents an effort to analyse development aid in a comprehensive conceptual framework. We draw on the existing theoretical and empirical research but also innovate. Different categories of recipient countries are possibly subject to dissimilar influences, which remains unaccounted for in empirical studies predominantly using aggregate levels of development assistance. This may compromise empirically-based recipes for reducing aid volatility and increasing aid effectiveness, in particular in the least developed countries. Our analysis, which takes into consideration methodologically-sensitive aspects of the data structure, yields results pointing to relatively different but also some similar effects between the three recipient categories.

2021	0408	421	The Electoral Consequences of New Political Actors: Progressive Party Success and Conservative Backlash	What are the consequences of new actors in the political arena? Recent research suggests that the emergence of radical right parties (RRPs) can defy long established democratic norms, with consequences for the behavior of both voters and political elites. We study whether that is part of a broader pattern by which new actors challenge the political establishment, provoke electoral backlash and increase polarization. With radical policy positions and new forms of organizing, Green parties were the first disruptors of post-war European party systems. However, little is known about the consequences of their emergence. We argue that Green party success threatens established norms of politics and thus provokes a backlash effect among conservative constituents. Whenever Green parties enter politics, conservatives are mobilized and subsequently turn out in higher numbers, which contributes to electoral polarization. We identify this effect with a difference-in-differences design on a newly compiled dataset based on voting records from Germany. While plenty of research emphasizes the role of the emergence of RRPs, our results suggest a more general pattern when new political actors emerge. Our findings become particularly relevant in a time of polarization and fragmentation across Western democracies.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0440	378	Putting on the Brakes: Radical Right Parties and Government Formation	Do radical right parties delay government formation? Right-wing populist and far right parties are on the rise across Europe. While established parties suffer dramatic electoral losses, right-wing parties enter one parliament after another. Recent research has studied the effect of parliamentary entry of right wing challenger parties on voter attitudes, polarization and party competition. However, despite the central importance of timely government formation for the stability and performance of political systems, we know very little about how the increasing electoral success of far right parties affects timely cabinet formation. Building on the literature on coalition formation, we argue that it is not sufficient to merely enter a parliament, but that right-wing populist and far right parties can only delay government formation when they have sufficient bargaining power. In order to test our argument, we compiled a new dataset covering 190 government formations in 22 West and East European countries from 1975 until 2019. Based on a regression discontinuity design complemented with an event history analysis, we show that the mere entry of a radical right party into parliament has no effect on government formation, but that radical right parties can significantly delay the formation of a cabinet when they are pivotal for a legislative majority. Our findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between party competition, polarization and government formation.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0424	523	Are Distant Voters More Likely to Reject the Establishment? The Effects of Perceived Ideological Congruence on Support for Challenger Parties	Voters across democracies have become increasingly likely to vote for challenger parties and to reject establishment parties. We argue that the degree of ideological congruence that voters perceive between themselves and their elected governments can affect their decision of whether to support a challenger party in the next election. When voters perceive themselves to be ideologically further away from their governments, we expect the probability of supporting a challenger party in the next election to increase. We expect this relationship to hold to varying degrees across three sets of voters: those who voted for a governing party in the last election, those who voted for an opposition establishment party in the last election, and those who supported a challenger party in the last election. The effect of perceived ideological congruence on support for challenger parties should also be stronger when elections are held under more proportional electoral rules. We draw on data from 54 elections held in 23 democracies included in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) to test these expectations. Our findings generally support our expectations and suggest that the probability of supporting a challenger party increases as the perceived ideological distance between a voter and the government grows.

2021	0392	80	Right Party Competition in Europe: The Electoral Strategies of the Far Right during Crises	Far-right parties appear to be updating their electoral strategies throughout the series of crises from the 2008-2013 economic crisis, the 2015-2018 refugee crisis, and on to the 2020-present COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst a focus on the key issue dimension of immigration as an electoral strategy continues to serve as the raison d’etre of far-right politics, newer strategies are being introduced to mobilise supporters, such as the post-materialist issue of environmentalism (i.e.: eco-nationalism/eco-fascism), with increasing success. We therefore ask: to what extent are far-right party strategies in Europe being updated across these crises and does this translate into electoral success for far-right parties? Using both qualitative case studies and quantitative analysis, we examine far-right parties’ electoral strategies in Western Europe (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom) and Central-Eastern Europe (Hungary and Poland). Our preliminary evidence identifies both the evolving strategies of modern far-right parties in three different crisis situations and that these crises create distinct and unique political opportunities for the far-right party family to benefit from electorally.

Understanding the consequences of a ban on corporate contributions: evidence from Brazil	We study the effects of the 2015 ban on corporate contributions in Brazil on the allocation of procurement contracts and the frequency of large personal contributions of corporate members, a channel to circumvent the ban. We use difference in differences regression models that compare outcomes of contributing and non-contributing firms before and after the ban. We document three findings. First, before the ban, contributing firms won 20 to 25% more procurement tenders per year than non-contributing firms. Second, the ban on corporate contributions significantly decreased the number of national procurement contracts won by contributing firms by 2 to 11 percentage points, a magnitude that only partially offset their previous advantage. Third, firms previously making large contributions circumvent the ban in both national and local elections with donations from owners and board members. Together, our findings suggest that a ban on corporate contributions have limited effects on the average influence of contributing firms when there are mechanisms to circumvent the ban.

2021	0409	566	Evidence of In-group and Out-group Dynamics in Subcentral Benchmarking	There is an open debate in the literature about whether voters in a democracy benchmark policy outcomes against those elsewhere, punishing (rewarding) incumbents for national outcomes that underperform (outperform) an international or regional comparison. In this paper we argue that the effect of benchmarking upon incumbents’ accountability is contingent on the specific region against which outcomes are compared. Historical developments within nations may separate regions into rival communities. A rival community may turn into out-group community when its members persistently prompt negative emotions and sentiments among the members of the in-group. Our main hypothesis is that the effect of benchmarking will more prominent when benchmarking is against an out-group community as compared to non-out-group communities. We test this hypothesis using a benchmarking experiment conducted separately in three Spanish regions - Catalonia, Madrid and Valencia - that vary in their rivalry connections. We treat individuals in each region with information that compares negatively the capacity of their region in fighting the COVID pandemic against: a) the national average; b) a non-out-group region; c) an out-group region. We then test whether regional incumbents are more severely punished when the negative comparison is against the out-group region.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour

The Roles of Political Affiliation, Value Systems, Experience, and Bureaucratic Performance	What determines American citizens’ views of the administrative state? For decades, the political discourse in the US has revolved around the question of what the role of government in society should be. A crucial component of this discourse is how American citizens perceive the administrative state, with views ranging from very positive attitudes to complete opposition and open hostility. In this study, based on an original survey with more than 1,100 participants, we present a comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence Americans’ attitudes toward the bureaucracy. Among others, we explore the roles that value systems, political affiliation, personal experience, and information about bureaucratic performance play. We empirically compare and contrast the relative influence of these factors in shaping individual perceptions of governmental institutions.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0393	323	Clientelism, Credibility, and Context	Voters often express mistrust in elected officials’ stated desires to help their constituents. They argue that politicians come bringing gifts and promises during elections, never to be seen until the next election comes. But how widespread are these sentiments? And, do perceptions of candidates vary depending on how closely knit their community is? This paper examines these questions, employing a conjoint experiment embedded in a unique survey in Malawi and Zambia, where a heavily clustered sampling strategy allowed for the collection of village- and individual-level data. It finds evidence that candidate characteristics, clientelistic offers and community characteristics all affect citizens’ expectations of services. Specifically, individuals in communities that are tightly knit are more skeptical that candidates will make good on their promises. Still, they are more likely to prefer candidates who reward communities that vote together than candidates who do not. These findings highlight the importance of considering how communities’ experiences with clientelism affect expectations regarding service provision. In communities where individuals know each other, the information flow that supports clientelism is stronger, and clientelistic offers may be more likely. Candidates find it both easier and more reliable to mobilize blocs of votes in these areas. However, once elected, politicians are not necessarily more likely to follow through with electoral promises. The result is that voters may be less likely to perceive such candidates as distributing resources in the future.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0451	416	Signal of Strength? Clientelism and Voters’ Expectations of Politicians’ Performance in Malawi and Zambia	How do clientelistic appeals affect voters' expectations of politicians' future performance? This paper examines this question, focusing on three dimensions of clientelism: the existence of cash or other goods at election time (often termed 'vote-buying'), the promise of future targeted benefits, and the degree of contingency involved. It employs a conjoint experiment, embedded in a unique survey of over 12,000 respondents in Malawi and Zambia, focus group discussions and observational data. We find that clientelistic behaviors during an election campaign have a greater impact on voters' perceptions of the candidates' future performance than it does on their willingness to support the candidate at the polls. Voters are less likely to have confidence in candidates offering handouts, seeing them as more likely to be corrupt, less likely to provide services, and less likely to mobilize resources; they prefer future promises of targeted future assistance over club goods, but they do not believe that candidates are likely to actually follow through on this promise; and they dislike explicitly contingent offers of service provision in exchange for political support. These findings draw into question expectations that handouts signal future service provision (e.g., the 'big man' hypothesis) and suggest that clientelism affects not only election outcomes, but citizens' confidence in their elected officials.

2021	0455	405	NIMBYism and mass public preferences in public goods provision – evidence from mobile phone antenna placement in Switzerland	When public good provision entails site placement decisions, public goods can become a private bad. In these cases, public goods have locally concentrated (subjective) costs caused by geographic proximity to sites. Prominent examples include the locations of wind turbines or hazardous waste disposals. We study whether this challenge extends to 5G mobile network expansion, a hotly contested issue in many Western democracies. Is opposition to 5G network expansion driven by “not in my backyard” (NIMBY)-effects? Can the widespread exposure to such local bads affect aggregate public policy preferences? We study these questions based on original public opinion data for Switzerland, a global frontrunner in 5G network expansion. Notably, public opposition to this expansion has picked up recently, both nationally (initiatives calling for a moratorium on new antennas) and locally (contestation of existing projects by residents). Combining conjoint and vignette survey experiments, we seek to understand public preferences on the 5G-rollout, and the extent to which it depends on geographic proximity to antennas. Drawing on a survey with geo-coded respondent locations, we randomly reveal actual 5G antenna placement to survey respondents and assess policy preferences when the “veil of ignorance” on the geographic distribution of antennas is lifted. We find that respondents are sceptical overall, and prefer a cautious rollout. Geographic proximity increases opposition to a 5G rollout ex ante, but decreases opposition once an antenna has already been placed close to respondents. Our research has implications for how the distribution of costs and benefits affects public good provision in democracies.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0441	571	Ownership of telecom companies and internet disruptions	Internet disruptions–the temporary halt of access to (specific) internet services–have become a popular tool in African countries to control the flow of digital information and communication, especially in autocracies during times of elections and mass protests. Ownership of the internet infrastructure, in particular internet service providers (ISP) is critical to understanding a state’s capacity to control such flow since most direct forms of control require ISP to comply with government requests. We propose to explore the relationship between ISP ownership and internet disruptions at times of political contestation in sub-Sahara and North Africa from 2016 until today, where countries show varying degrees of authoritarianism, economic development, and internet penetration. We seek to make at least two scientific contributions. First, we propose a more realistic understanding of the societal, political and economic implications of internet provision and its disruption in authoritarian-developing contexts, taking into account the role of telecommunication companies. Second, we develop a tool that allows to infer variance in ISP behavior at times of political contestation based on abnormal trends in the use of popular circumvention services.	Comparative Politics
2021	0426	167	Under Pressure? Parties, Voters, and Legislator Ideology Reconsidered	For years, countless scholars have posited the role of constituency and party pressure on legislators’ roll call voting records. Indeed, though popular estimates of legislators’ preferences come from roll call data (e.g., NOMINATE or ADA scores), most scholars are careful to note that these are not necessarily measures of ideology per se but rather of legislators’ revealed preferences—that is, they reflect both legislators’ ideological commitments as well as the influence of party and constituency. In this paper, we offer robust evidence that legislators’ roll call records may be closer to their preferences than once thought. Using a novel survey of former members of the House of Representatives, we leverage the severing of the electoral connection and lack of institutional party pressure to show that legislators’ preferences as measured by NOMINATE scores (Poole and Rosenthal, 1997) closely mirror their own perceptions of themselves. Additionally, employing the Aldrich and McKelvey (1977) perceptual scaling algorithm, we demonstrate legislators’ sophistication in their ability to identify the ideology of important American political actors.

2021	0410	373	Designing Electoral Districts. How Electoral Geography and Partisan Politics Constrain Proportionality and Create Bias	Proportional representation (PR) electoral systems are supposed to ensure the representation of interests with small or geographically inefficiently distributed voter bases. Yet, in reality, most PR systems consist of a large number of districts that vary strongly in size and some have surprisingly low magnitude. Research shows that such differences matter for partisan outcomes and the effective proportionality of PR systems. We argue that the design of electoral districts in newly adopted PR systems is systematically linked to electoral geography and partisan politics. If parties with concentrated voter bases influence the design of the new electoral system, we expect to observe the creation of PR systems with a significant number of low magnitude districts. In general, parties involved in designing districts benefit from electoral disproportionalities under the new PR rules. Empirically, we use newly collected data for electoral reforms in ten European countries at the turn to the 20th century.	Comparative Politics
2021	0394	294	When Do Elections Help Autocrats?: The Plight of Tribes under SNTV in Jordan	In Jordan, tribes behave much like political parties during elections. They hold tribal primaries, nominate candidates, and mobilize voters. Tribal affiliation also functions much like party affiliation with most voters supporting candidates from their own tribe. But when facing strategic dilemmas, do tribes act in the same manner as political parties? Using the case of Jordan, I examine tribal coordination under the single non-transferable electoral system (SNTV). SNTV is well-known for causing coordination problems across parties, especially for those with enough electoral support to win more than one seat in a district. I demonstrate that coordination failures also occur amongst tribes in Jordan and explore the main causes of variation in intra-tribal coordination. Finally, I offer some conclusions as to whether SNTV privileges pro-regime tribes over opposition tribes with regard to electoral coordination.	Comparative Politics
2021	0427	235	Walking the line: Electoral cycles and the shift in legislative priorities among German Parliamentarians	In this paper, we argue that members of parliament (MPs) balance vote-seeking and policy-seeking incentives over the electoral cycle. We ask how and why MPs change the priorities of their legislative activities during legislative terms. To answer this question, we study a unique longitudinal dataset on committee membership and parliamentary questions in the German Bundestag together with survey data on issue salience in the German public. We argue that, as elections approach, they increasingly take issues of particular salience for the population into account. However, issue ownership and party competition moderate this relationship. While most previous research understand MPs' responsiveness as a static concept, we reveal that it varies over time. The results have important implications for political representation and the capacity of parliamentary elections to secure the responsiveness of elected officials.

2021	0452	129	Cultivating a Personal Vote can Increase Legislative Cohesion: Evidence from Clientelistic Parties in Mexico	Most research on legislative cohesion suggests that electoral systems that incentivize legislators to cultivate a personal vote generate less cohesive parties. Scholars expect reelection incentives to undercut legislative cohesion because deviating from the party helps legislators enhance their personal reputations. In contrast, this article posits that reelection incentives can increase legislative cohesion in places with clientelistic parties. It can do so, because party leaders are able to condition legislators' access to particularistic benefits on legislators' loyalty to the party's agenda. To test this hypothesis, I estimate the ideological placement of Mexican local legislators by applying correspondence analysis to a new dataset of over half a million individual speeches given by legislators to their respective local congresses in 20 Mexican states from 2012 to 2018. Conducting a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the staggered implementation of the 2014 Mexican Electoral Reform, which lifted a constitutional ban on reelection established in 1933, I find that the introduction of reelection incentives increases legislative cohesion and that the effect is driven by SSD-elected legislators.

2021	0442	345	Risk Preferences and Outcome Bias in the Delegation Process	As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, many political decisions involve a high level of uncertainty. Policy outcomes are thus subject to chance. However, when evaluating the past performance of politicians, voters tend to focus on policy outcomes rather than on the political decisions and the circumstances under which they were taken, leading to less than optimal voting decisions. In this study, we examine this so-called outcome bias and its effect on the delegation process. In an online experiment, subjects assigned the role of a politician decide how much to invest in a risky policy, whereas subjects assigned the role of a voter decide whether to re-elect the politicians based on the politicians’ decision and the outcome. The treatments, which vary potential reward and risk of the policy, allow us to derive causally whether the probability of success affects (I) voters’ preferences for political delegates or trustees in decisions taken under uncertainty, (II) the magnitude of voters’ outcome bias, and (III) politicians’ responsiveness to voters’ risk preferences and biases. Considering the outcome bias, in some instances it may be better for politicians to disregard voters’ risk preferences and focus on the sheer probability of policy success. In this manner, the study provides novel insights into the role of risk and risk preferences in representative democracies.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0411	659	Political (self-)selection and competition: Evidence from U.S. Congressional elections	How does competition affect the entry and selection of politicians? I use data on U.S. Congressional primary and general elections for the years 1998-2014 to study this question. I measure quality using previous legislative experience and the novel “identity match” quantifying how well candidates demographically represent their district. To identify causal effects, I rely on variation in competition caused by demographic changes resulting from decennial redistricting. Difference-in-difference estimates reveal differences between the electorally dominant and weak party. They show that experienced candidates avoid competition in primary elections in the strong party. As opposed to this, experienced candidates and candidates with a good identity match run relatively more frequently in primary elections in the weak party as competition increases. The effects of competition and entry overall cancel each other out so that there are no effects on the quality and identity match of the eventual winner of the general election.

2021	0395	32	How Does Constituency-Level Partisan Dealignment Affect Parliamentary Behaviour?	Recent work has suggested that when voters are less partisan, legislators engage in more personal vote-seeking. This has potentially important implications, given the widespread decline of partisanship in many countries, and the well-noted consequences of personal vote-seeking for policy-making, election results, and accountability. However, existing tests of this argument use either aggregate-level measures of partisanship, or constituency-level proxy measures. We thus lack direct evidence linking constituency-level partisan dealignment to MPs’ parliamentary behaviour. To address this lacuna, this paper uses multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to produce new estimates of constituency-level partisan dealignment in the UK between 2010 and 2017. I then test the relationship between these estimates and – as an indicator of personal vote-seeking – MPs’ constituency focus in parliamentary speeches. I find that when MPs represent a less partisan constituency, they talk more about that constituency in parliament. This offers new evidence that local voters’ attitudes to political parties shape the way their elected representatives behave.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0412	187	Party Institutions and Social Welfare	It is widely acknowledged that democracy affects economic growth and social welfare. The existing political economy literature, however, rarely disaggregates political institutions in ways that generate testable propositions about causal mechanisms. Our project seeks to advance this important strand of research by reconceptualizing both the independent and dependent variables. Specifically, we argue that stronger party systems, characterized by electoral competition between few disciplined parties, are more likely to implement effective government policies that generate inclusive economic growth than weaker systems with undisciplined or multiple coalition parties. We then show that government investments in early childhood education and care (ECEC) and family in-kind benefits are especially good at promoting long-term social welfare. To test our argument, we estimate the effect of party institutions on such future-oriented government spending by exploiting the timing of major changes to party discipline and fragmentation in an original dataset covering the last forty years in OECD countries. Overall, we show that political systems in which parties are large and disciplined are more likely to spend on effective public policies.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics

It is therefore not surprising that a majority of workers in the private pension scheme pay for advice, while many entitled to public benefits leave money on the table by not applying. This decision making impasse can have negative impact on retiree welfare. Delegating pension decisions to someone that `knows best' does not ensure one will get the best offer available, in fact during 2018-19 only 50\% of retirees choose one of the three best alternatives available to them (Duch et al 2020). Not applying to public benefits, when eligible, is a clear welfare loss, however disagreeable it is to deal with bureaucracy if there is a risk of getting left for not meeting inncome requirement. We argue that one way to address this is by reducing the effort needed to access information and we do this by experimentally measuring the impact of changing the structure and format of pension websites on the willingness to engage in decision making tasks. Baseline websites have a Frequently Asked Questions (a.k.a. Product oriented) structure with information in text, while the experimental innovations change to a Profile oriented structure with videos in a 2*2 treatment design. The robustness of the innovation is compared across with and without access to public benefits and information is tailored to specific requirements.

2021	0428	134	European social democracy and the trade-offs of party competition in post-industrial societies	In this paper we investigate the programmatic determinants of support for social democratic parties in Western Europe. Social democratic parties have seen a strong electoral decline in the past 20 years. This development has been linked to the structural transformations of post-industrial societies and the programmatic choices of social democratic parties in a transforming political space. While much debate exists about how specific strategic choices of social democratic parties have affected their support, empirical research on this question is scarce. The observational studies that do exist face the fundamental challenge that party positions (for example measured through manifestos) and electoral performance are likely endogenous. In order to address this issue, we have fielded conjoint experiments in 5 Western European countries (AT, DE, DK, ES, SE) in which respondents can choose between social democratic programs that vary on a number of issue dimensions. The findings allow us to show the potentials of different programmatic appeals to different societal groups. They indicate that social democratic parties indeed face a fundamental trade-off when it comes to their positional choices. These findings provide an important contribution not only to the study of social democratic decline but also to questions of representation in a changing political space more generally.

2021	0397	488	Strategic alignment in times of crisis: Voting at the dawn of a global pandemic	Natural disasters are likely to increase in the near future. How does the anticipation of such events influence voting behavior? We study the effect of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral choice. We combine a case study of a local election in Bavaria, Germany, with original survey data. The election took place at the beginning of the pandemic, when only some parts of Bavaria had recorded cases. We find that local outbreaks favored candidates from the political party that was governing at the state level, and show that established theories of voting behavior cannot easily explain this effect. We theorize that our findings are driven instead by a `strategic alignment' mechanism, whereby voters choose the party or candidate they believe is best placed to help them through the crisis. We confirm the validity of our mechanism with a survey experiment fielded during the pandemic.	Comparative Politics
2021	0429	385	Blame and credit attribution for economic shocks	Economic shocks occur regularly across European democracies. Despite the prevalence and electoral relevance of such shocks, the overall results on their impact on voting behavior have been inconclusive. I test this conclusion with a new dataset of sub-national (NUTS-2 level) European and legislative elections results and labor market shocks for 27 European democracies for the 2003 – 2020 period. The panel data estimations confirm the mixed findings, irrespective of type of shock (e.g. positive vs. negative) and outcome (incumbent support vs. change in the incumbent support). I posit that attribution of responsibility could explain the mixed findings. I argue that attribution of political responsibility for sociotropic shocks (e.g. plant closure) is contingent on contextual factors (the type of restructuring event; the affected industry; the number of impacted workers; the sex of workers; the institutional set-up) and individual predispositions (personal job insecurity, nationalism, partisanship). As Central and Eastern Europe is a fertile ground for offshoring and automation, I focus on the Romanian case, for which economic shocks also have an ambiguous effect on incumbent support. The key test involves a conjoint experiment conducted on a sample recruited through Facebook. I expose voters to hypothetical scenarios triggered by negative restructuring events (e.g. offshoring, automation) and ask them to evaluate the effect of the scenarios on political attribution and voting behavior. I also analyze positive shocks (e.g. job creation due to technological progress). To validate my conjoint analysis, I employ a vignette experiment both in the Facebook survey and a nationally representative sample.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0443	449	Perceptions of Local Economic Decline: who perceives decline, and why does it matter?	Recent research shows that localised economic decline drives important political outcomes, in particular support for populism. Economic decline is measured using long-term administrative data to generate average treatment effects. In this paper, we ask: who can judge economic decline? Using new survey-based measures of localised economics together with a range of contextual data, we reveal the individual-level determinants of economic decline perceptions and the degree to which accuracy is determined by geographic units and types of economic measurement. Using these insights, we reveal the heterogeneous effects of economic decline perceptions on support for Britain’s exit from the European Union (Brexit). The implications of this paper are important for the conclusions we draw about the electoral importance of localised economic decline and inequalities, and the limitations and important scope conditions of those effects.

2021	0413	36	Austerity, Economic Vulnerability, and Populism	Governments have repeatedly adjusted fiscal policy during the past decades. We examine the political effects of these adjustments in Western countries since the early 1990s using both district-level election outcomes and individual-level voting data. We expect that austerity increases populist votes, but only among economically vulnerable voters who are hit most by austerity. Following the political economy literature, we identify economically vulnerable regions looking at the share of low-skilled workers, share of manufacturing production, and share of workers in routine jobs. The results from a difference-in-differences analysis show that austerity increases support for populist parties in economically vulnerable regions, but austerity has little effect on voting in economically less vulnerable regions. These findings are confirmed by the analysis at the individual level. Our results suggest that the success of populist parties across Europe critically hinges on the government's failure to protect the losers of structural economic change. The economic origins of populism, therefore, are not purely external, but the populist backlash is triggered by internal factors, notably public policies.

2021	0453	104	Exploring preference prioritization under austerity	To what extent does a party-wide austerity consensus systematically change voters’ preference prioritizations? Recent literature shows that policy preferences are not static and unidimensional, but rather changeable and multidimensional. With a specific focus on spending and taxation preferences, I expect that these characteristics increasingly materialize under austerity. When there is a cross-party consensus that government deficit spending is not an option anymore, I expect, voters will accept this paradigm and change their priorities accordingly. Middle-income voters in particular, who I expect to favour high levels of spending and low levels of taxation, are under a balanced budget forced into choosing. Either they will align with the rich, prioritizing low taxation and willing to give up high spending or the align with lower income groups, prioritizing high spending and are willing to pay higher taxation for that. The paper combines three waves of ISSP data from 1996-2016 in combination with party manifesto data on parties’ policy position on austerity from the CMP to explore how austerity affects the trade-offs that middle-income voters face.

2021	0414	329	How to pay for Covid? The impact of the pandemic on preferences for taxes and spending	The Covid-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented economic crisis in many advanced democracies. GDP growth has plummeted and unemployment has sharply risen. Governments have supported massive job retention packages and other economic measures. Income inequality is likely to rise for the next few years. One of the key challenges in the post-Covid world will be to get the public finances in balance again. As we know from previous research, wide public support is needed in order to raise taxes and/or pay for social benefit programs. In this paper we investigate how different frames and aspects of the current Covid crisis affect public attitudes towards taxing and spending. On the basis of income-maximising and risk-based theories of redistribution preferences, we assess whether an exogenous shock like the Covid crisis can generate a new coalition in support for different forms of taxation and spending: progressive income taxation and wealth taxes on the one hand, as well as spending on health and employment. The hypotheses are tested using original survey experiments in the US and the UK, two countries particularly affected by the pandemic.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0444	518	Trust, Information and Redistributive Preferences in Pandemic Italy	The paper examines how information on collective action affects the social welfare preferences of voters, in the context of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. What happens to the social welfare preferences of voters when their expectations concerning collective behavior are met, or even exceeded? And what conversely occurs when these expectations are unmet, and their trust is thereby breached? To explore these questions, we design a quasi-experimental survey directed to a representative sample of the Italian voting age population. In it, a randomly assigned subset of respondents is exposed to real-world information on lockdown compliance rates during the peak of the first Italian COVID-19 lockdown (April 2020). Leveraging this (pre-registered) design, we can then examine the extent to which information on compliance rates affects the social policy preferences of voters, conditional on pre-treatment levels of displayed community trust. We examine voter attitudes toward a broad range of welfare policy dimensions, as our main outcomes of interest: these include social policy generosity, conditionality, and universalism, as well as tax financing and tax progressivity. In addition, we perform several mechanism tests to ascertain the potential causes of uncovered causal effects.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0430	463	COVID-19 and Inter-Generational Conflict	OECD countries are going through a demographic change which has no precedent in human history and the COVID-19 pandemic has made age and how different policies benefit a given age group at the expense of another more salient. The political implications of the growing size of the elderly vis-à-vis the rest of the adult population have been understudied in political science. In this study, we analyze the conditions under which a society's old-age structure affects political conflict. We present evidence from two studies. In our first study, we rely on a novel dataset to show that the old-age structure of European countries correlates with inter-generational conflict. Specifically, inter-generational conflict is lower in those countries that have a lop-sided age distribution, either skewed towards the young or towards the old. In a second study, we present evidence from pre-registered and well-powered survey experiments in Italy and the Netherlands to examine the extent to which COVID-19 pandemic fuels inter-generational conflict. Our evidence suggests that exposing respondents to the intergenerational trade-offs associated with non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the pandemic increases inter-generational conflict, but only in the context where the age distribution was skewed towards the elderly (Italy). This evidence has important implications for societal and scientific debates about inter-generational solidarity and policy-making aimed at different generations. It suggests that the pandemic when certain conditions are present may have long-lasting disruptive effects on the social fabric of our societies.	Comparative Politics

As the UK’s response to COVID-19 continues to unfold, some occupations have become more visible and valued by virtue of them being considered ‘essential’ or ‘key’ to the country’s ability to deal with the crisis. Large proportions of workers in these occupations and sectors are foreign-born, yet current immigration requirements based on salary and education would prevent them from qualifying for permanent residency or publicly-funded benefits. Has the pandemic changed public attitudes and welfare policy preferences towards these groups? We report findings from an ongoing three-wave panel study (initial wave N = 5,022) which tracks how British respondents have been economically impacted by COVID-19 alongside an embedded conjoint experiment. The experiment measures preferences towards immigrant profiles that vary by national origins (comprising a variety of EU and non-EU countries) and occupations (essential and non-essential jobs). We investigate whether and how immigrants’ occupational essentialness—moderated by respondents’ own economic situations during the pandemic—impacts three outcomes: admission preferences; perceptions of economic impact; and willingness to extend access to a variety of welfare benefits including housing assistance, primary medical care, and Universal Credit (a form of payment for living costs). We also explore whether these patterns vary regionally, as different parts of the country continue to experience the pandemic and subsequent interventions differently. Our results not only speak theoretically and empirically to the dynamics of immigration attitudes during crises, but also to ongoing discussions about how governments should develop future immigration policies.

2021	0445	383	Affective polarization and elections. How do (strong) partisans react?	Polarization is a major factor in democratic decay. While ideological polarization is relatively stable, affective polarization, the process of feeling close to one’s partisan in-group and distant from partisan out-groups, has globally increased. Despite the focus on the United States, many questions are left unanswered for both developed and developing democracies. Is affective polarization an issue for strong partisans or the general population? Who is the target of out-party animus, is it the out-party elites, members or voters? How can we mitigate affective polarization? Does contact between strong partisans foster less polarization? Using an original and unique three-wave panel of party members and supporters of a new political party in Romania, just before and after legislative elections, our pre-registered investigation targets three questions: 1) Does contact with strong partisans of an out-party in a precinct during election day decrease affective polarization; 2) Which agent of the out-party is polarization mostly directed toward; 3) How strong is affective polarization in a post-communist democracy, with a communist successor party. We argue that: 1) sustained contact should reduce polarization towards equal status members of the least liked party (members and voters), but not for opposed party’s leaders; and 2) initial polarization should be mainly targeted toward the out-party elites. This research provides a deeper understanding of affective polarization in developing democracies, offers a new database of party members and delegates in polling stations and is a seminal investigation of the effects contact between strong partisans might have on polarization.

A growing literature recognizes that political polarization partially stems from changes in the media landscape. While a range of countries have experienced marked declines in the number of local news outlets as well as news readership, there is little work that explores how local news exits affect polarization. To study this relationship, we draw on a novel panel data set of the coverage areas of all German newspapers between 1979 and 2009. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that newspaper exits increase electoral polarization, as measured by a common polarization scale as well as by the vote share of parties further from the center. We propose that voters consume more national news when local news outlets exit. As a result, voters are increasingly exposed to politics at the national level, where decision making is more ideologically charged and less consensual than at the local level.

2021	0431	340	Affective polarization and support for populist parties	Partisan affective polarization broadly refers to the extent that individuals feel sympathy towards their preferred parties and their supporters and antagonism towards the other parties and their voters. At the same time, populist parties are able to mobilize voters through a rhetoric that differentiates between, on the one hand, the “pure” people and, on the other hand, the “corrupt” elite or minority groups that are seen as excluded from the people. This paper aims to explore the relationship between affective polarization and support for populist parties at the individual level: Are those individuals holding higher levels of affective polarization more likely to support populist parties, even when ideological polarization is held constant? Is this relationship different for populist right parties and populist left parties? Affective polarization and populist party support reinforce each other over time? I address these questions through two different types of analysis. First, a comparative cross-sectional analysis is implemented based on the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) and the Comparative National Elections Project (CNEP) datasets. Second, I take advantage of a panel dataset (The E-Dem Panel Survey Dataset) conducted between October 2018 and May 2019 in Spain that provides crucial information on affective polarization and political behavior. Spain constitutes a suitable case study for the purposes of this paper due to the presence of a strong populist radical left party (Unidas Podemos) together with a new populist radical right party (Vox) that surged during the implementation of the panel survey.

2021	0399	128	When Policies Become Irrelevant: The Effect of Polarized Attitudes on Vote Switching	Behavioral consequences of political polarization have recently started to attract scholarly attention. Despite high and growing polarization in many democracies in recent decades, scholarly research on polarization’s effects on voting behavior, however, has been rather limited. In this paper, we evaluate how voters’ non-policy and policy considerations interactively affect their calculi of voting and their decision to remain loyal to their parties or to defect. Informing our theoretical expectations from the vast literatures on spatial and behavioral theories of voting behavior, we hypothesize that the effects of policy evaluations on the propensity of switching votes between consecutive elections for individuals with higher levels of affective polarization is of lower magnitude than that for those with less polarized attitudes. We argue, with increasing polarization, the mass public's responsiveness to parties' policy offerings decreases because the issues at stake become more of a matter of `us vs. them' than mere policy preferences. Employing the CSES data, a series of logistic regressions provide evidence for that polarized attitudes decrease the effects of policy preferences on economy, health, and business and industry on the propensity of vote switching. By demonstrating that non-policy considerations may make the policy considerations of those with polarized attitudes less salient, we present a more nuanced theoretical account of voting behavior and try to present a solution for an important puzzle in literature. The implications of our findings are discussed from the perspectives of not only economic and issue voting, but also democratic representation and accountability.

2021	0446	626	Housing, Assets and the Populist Radical Right	Support for populist radical right (PRR) parties and politicians has considerably increased across advanced industrialized democracies in recent years. However, the causes of their rising popularity continue to be widely debated. One stream of scholarship attributes the PRR’s rise to economic factors, arguing that these parties primarily cater to the economically insecure, low-skilled losers of modernization and globalization. Yet, previous research has failed to establish a strong connection between modest or deteriorating economic conditions and PRR support at the individual- level. Given this lack of strong evidence, many prominent narratives have downplayed the role of economic factors and instead argued that rising PRR support is primarily a cultural backlash against rising immigration or long-term social change. We build on, and move beyond, these debates by bringing to light novel, thus far overlooked dimensions of political behaviour related to housing and assets. To causally identify how changes in housing prices and assets influence PRR support, we draw on individual-level panel data from multiple advanced democracies. In so doing, our study sheds light on the conditions under which economic factors play a role in influencing PRR support and uncovers the importance of relative economic conditions rather than absolute economic deprivation as central for understanding it.

2021	0432	471	The Populist Zeitgeist and Parliamentary Discourse	The recent emergence of right-wing populists proved to be a tremendous challenge for political systems across Western Europe. This should also apply to legislative institutions. Growing polarization between parliamentary party groups and ignorance towards representative democracy are likely to be accompanied by a more aggressive tone, also among established parties. Furthermore, challenger parties should moderate once they enter parliament, as they are included not only in public speech, but also legislative processes and parliamentary committees. There is little systematic research on how right-wing populists have affected debates, processes, and norms within legislatures. This contribution presents a new corpus of more than 900,000 speeches held in 16 German state parliaments over 30 years that allows comparative analysis inside the same political system. We measure the incivility of political discourse using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, measuring the changes in tone over time. To capture populism, we develop and validate a dictionary for populist speech using word embeddings. We find that right-wing populists approach parliamentary discourse as expected. They communicate more populist and negative – which, however, does not affect other parties’ behaviour significantly. Instead, we observe a generally positive trend in sentiment. Interestingly, tone seems to be mainly determined by the opposition-government cleavage.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0416	317	The normalization of radical politics: Polling, electoral performance, and reported vote switching	The normalization of radical politics has had decisive transformative impact on Western party systems over the course of the past 50 years. Radical parties, which typically campaign on messages initially considered outside the range of acceptability, have increasingly cast off the stigma of societal and political ostracism and have come to enjoy sizable and overt electoral support. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this process of normalization and legitimization. We argue that the initial exceedance of expected electoral support legitimizes radical parties in the eyes of their supporters. As a result, voters will be more likely to disclose their support for radical parties and treat them as viable alternatives to established parties. Specifically, we hypothesize that radical parties’ electoral overperformance relative to the average pre-election polls sends a strong signal of increasing legitimacy, which will lead to lower levels of underreporting in vote choice for these parties and higher levels of disclosed vote switching from established mainstream parties to radical challengers parties in post-election surveys. These mechanisms of dynamic normalization will be most pronounced when radical parties first break through into national party systems. We test our arguments using a newly compiled data set that marries a large collection of post-election surveys with pre-election polls and official election results.

2021	0400	150	Going Mainstream: Does Mainstream Media Platforming Legitimize Radical Right Views?	Does the willingness of mainstream media to provide platforms to radical actors radicalize citizens, or are media platforms just reflecting the increasing radicalization of the electorate? Existing research on the media's potential role in affecting audiences' political beliefs is inconclusive. While some studies show that media coverage increases the electoral appeal of far-right actors, other suggest that it can undermine support or lead to polarisation. Our study tests competing theoretical expectations about whether exposure to radical right views should increase or decrease support for these views via a survey experiment (N=3000), which we plan to field in Australia. Employing a 2x2 factorial design, the experiment uses a recent audio recording from a mainstream Australian network's interview with a far-right activist to test if exposing subjects to the audio legitimizes the activist's views, and whether the platform confers legitimacy. The first experimental arm varies whether subjects are exposed to the audio of the interview or to a weather report, and the second arm varies whether the network which broadcast the interview/forecast is mainstream (Sky News) or extreme (Youtube Channel). In this paper, we outline the research design, and perform design diagnostics. We hope that this experiment will be able to contribute to our understanding of the media's role in legitimizing radical views.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour

For men born in regions featuring a strong regional identity, we find that being assigned to military service in a different region substantially increases self-identification as Spanish, increases the likelihood of voting in national elections and reduces the probability of voting for a regionalist party. Moreover, in support of intergroup contact as the main mechanism behind these results, we find that movers are more likely to have friends from other regions than nonmovers.

2021	0042	279	Interregional Contact and National Identity	We study the long-run effects of contact with individuals from other regions on beliefs, preferences and national identity. We combine a natural experiment, the random assignment of male conscripts to different locations throughout Spain, with tailored survey data. Being randomly assigned to complete military service outside of one's region of residence fosters contact with conscripts from other regions, and increases sympathy towards people from the region of service, measured several decades later. We also observe an increase in identification with Spain for individuals originating from regions with peripheral nationalism. Our evidence suggests that intergroup exposure in early adulthood can have long-lasting effects on individual preferences and national identity.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0003	411	Trading Wealth for Political Control? The Political Economy of Territorial Reforms	Under which circumstances do political jurisdictions engage in territorial reforms? Existing research on international, regional, and local integration and secession reforms has highlighted the pivotal relevance of jurisdictions' size and wealth. However, we lack quantitative and comparative evidence on the relative importance of these two factors as well as on their interaction. This paper analyzes referendum decisions on territorial reforms in Switzerland to answer this question. Using data from municipal merger referenda in 1477 municipalities that were involved in 418 merger projects since 2000, I examine how relative wealth and size are linked to the acceptance or rejection of a merger project. The results show that both having a lower tax rate than merger partners -- indicative of higher wealth -- and a small population share in the merger coalition -- indicating a lack of political control -- reduce voters' acceptance of merger projects in referendum decisions. Yet, a positive interaction effect between tax rate difference and relative size suggests that large municipalities are willing to trade wealth for political control by incorporating small and poor municipalities. The latter, by contrast, are willing to trade political control for wealth. These results have important implications for the design of politically feasible territorial reform coalitions.

2021	0049	94	Geopolitical constraints? Explaining Geography and Potential in International Politics	The realist theoretical tradition and the (neo)classical geopolitical approach equally departure from the examination of the international systemic constraints to explain the external behavior of states. This paper is an attempt to gain insight into these international systemic constraints – or the distribution of capabilities – which exist in the international arena and which are considered as an independent variable, thus influencing the dependent variable (state’s behavior). Geopolitical studies, and their theoretical principles, in addition to the author’s pioneering definition of geopolitics, provide the angle of observation of the problem. The objectives help in structuring the research by (a) contextualizing potential and geography as pillars of the independent variable of the model of neoclassical geopolitics, (b) defining potential and explaining how potential can become a predictive tool of state’s behavior, (c) distinguishing potential from power, and (d) offering introductory traces on how to evaluate state’s potential through six geopolitical factors, at the same time, listing a set of difficulties that such a task carries. The objectives are, consequently, conceptual and operational. One of the innovative contributions of this paper is to place geography as, simultaneously, a set of factors of potential and a determinant of systemic constraints – the latter is concerned with the limitations imposed by geography, whereas the incentives open the possibilities for the intervening variables of the neoclassical geopolitics’ model (the geopolitical agent’s perceptions and capacities).

2021	0016	158	Political Geography: Class VS. Ethnicity in a Contested City	The dominant stream of political geography research links ethnic or racial marginalization and class-based marginalization resulting from gentrification processes. This study presents a new phenomenon of 'Arab gentrification'; Gentrification led by Arab entrepreneurs and business owners in the contested city of Acre, which challenges the dominant research narrative and emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between class and ethno-national identity. Based on a qualitative research method that included in-depth interviews with Arab business owners and lower-income tenants, and analysis of policy documents and press articles, this study offers the term “stratified marginalization” to describe the relative advantage of Arab and business owners over lower-income Arab tenants. Simultaneously, it describes the trap in which they find themselves between their ethno-national and class identities and the justifications they provide for the gentrification process. Finally, the study describes the tension between Arabs from different classes as a result of gentrification. The research findings contribute to a re-evaluation of class and ethno-nationalism intersectionality in a way that recognizes the benefits of gentrification for the middle-class ethnic group on the one hand, and the multiple margins of the lower-class ethnic group on the other.

2021	0417	137	The Istanbul Convention and Gender Politics: A Comparative Analysis of Bulgaria and Poland	The Istanbul Convention is the first European treaty specifically targeting all forms of gender-based violence and, thus, it is a very significant development (McQuigg 2011; Niemi et al 2020). States that ratified the Convention have an obligation to protect and support survivors of such violence and establish services such as hotlines, shelters, medical services, counselling and legal aid. Although 45 states and the EU have signed the Istanbul Convention, several states did not ratify it. Why? The article will examine the ratification process of the Istanbul Convention in Bulgaria and Poland. Whereas Poland ratified the convention, Bulgaria’s Constitutional Tribunal rejected it. However, in both countries, contestation over the Convention is ongoing in the context of democratic backsliding. This article contributes to the scholarly literature for several reasons. First, it disentangles the complexity of political ideology to demonstrate how gender relations constitute an integral aspect of it. Instead of looking at the role of feminist movements (Htun and Weldon 2018), this research focuses on political ideology. Second, this project investigates how and to what extent anti-gender groups influence policy choices and a neoconservative social agenda. Third, understanding the interaction of international and domestic norms can shed light on policy responses to violence against women. Finally, the use of comparative politics and policy adds a new dimension to existing studies on domestic violence in psychology, anthropology, public health and criminology. This new lens is needed (e.g. Elman 2013; Celis et 2013). This article utilises the most similar systems design (Landman 2008).	Comparative Politics
2021	0447	499	Internal Divisions within Governments and International Cooperation	How can international cooperation be maintained when faced with actors outside the regime? I analyze this question in the context of the Export Credit Agreement. This agreement aims to limit price competition among Export-Import Banks of OECD governments by establishing minimum price levels. Since 2010, member governments have complained about unfair competition by Chinese state-subsidized export credits. Consequently, members have tried to incorporate China into the agreement. Interestingly, China is not the first instance of outside competitors threatening to undermine cooperation: In the 1980s, Japan also offered subsidized export credits to stimulate their export industries. The US and European countries were able to incorporate Japan into the regime in the 1980s, but appear unable to do the same with China today. I analyze this difference in outcomes. I suggest that the interplay between domestic politics within the hegemon as well as the challenger determine the international dynamics of cooperation. Incorporation of an outsider is possible if divisions among the various ministries of the challenger government can be exploited to incentivize collaboration. Conversely, when member governments are internally divided, the challenger cannot be co-opted. Extensive archival evidence of internal government documents offers strong support for my theory.

A Conjoint Experiment on Popular Support for Institutional Design Principles	The specific institutional design features used for building international alliances for producing and distributing COVID19 vaccines are likely to be crucial for citizens’ subsequent acceptance of, and cooperation with, vaccination policies. This study explores German citizens’ preferences for the building blocks of such international vaccine alliances. In a conjoint experiment, respondents are asked to compare two hypothetical vaccine alliances and to decide which of these Germany should join. The international alliance profiles vary with respect to four building blocks, each composed of two attributes: (1) alliance composition (size; Europeanness), (2) solidary distribution rules (allocation of costs; vaccine allocation), (3) vaccine nationalism (cost per German household; coverage in Germany), and (4) vaccine confidence (country of origin; producer type). We find that support for joining an international vaccine alliance depends on both attributes of vaccine nationalism and on vaccine origin, but not on solidary distribution rules or vaccine producer type.

2021	0401	384	Who cares about IOs? Exploring worldwide visibility of international organizations in media	This paper uses large-scale automated text analysis to explore the patterns of online media visibility international organizations (IOs). I develop a theoretical framework in which IOs’ visibility in media is driven by relative interest of countries in the IOs’ work and operations. Most IOs are primarily financed by great powers and high-income countries, and these exercise formal and informal control over them. But I argue that IOs’ media visibility is particularly high in countries in which they actually operate, typically low-income countries and LDCs. A mismatch between de facto control and public information within mechanisms of IOs’ accountability ensues. To evaluate the validity of the framework, I present a first truly global empirical account of the worldwide online media coverage of more than 50 IOs, including most major ones. This account is based on an automated analysis of news text from across almost all states of the world, and a wide variety of more than 30,000 online media outlets, in the years 2019-2020. The uniquely rich new dataset enables me to test the core theoretical propositions of the paper but also, for the first time, to relate the public visibility of such a large number of diverse IOs to their important features, including their delegated authority.

2021	0418	175	Tweeting out loud. Coalition signals in social media	As coalition governments are the norm in most proportional systems, parties typically signal their coalition preferences before elections. Yet, there are proportional systems where coalition governments are uncommon and where parties do not send clear coalition signals to their electorate. When facing an election in which polls indicate that no single party will gain a majority and in which a coalition government will become necessary, parties in those systems are then in a situation in which they should announce their coalition preferences in order to enable voters to make an informed decision. The way in which parties signal their preferences concerning future alliances in systems with little experience with coalition governments is an understudied topic despite its utmost relevance. Will they follow typical patterns of coalition signaling, or will they signal more unusual preferences? We analyze the patterns of these inexperienced parties’ coalition signals and compare them to the patterns that we find in systems where coalition governments are the norm. The content of parties’ social media accounts provides us with the necessary information as parties might want to use these platforms to broadcast who their preferred partners are. We therefore assess Spanish and German parties’ and party leaders’ tweets before an election and extract their coalition preferences from there. Our findings hold important implications for representative democracy and provide valuable insights into parties’ communication patterns.	Political Communications
2021	0434	341	Who wants to go with whom? Identifying coalition signals in newspaper articles using supervised machine learning	During election campaigns party elites often communicate which coalition they might or might not be willing to enter after the election. These public statements about prospects of future governments are often picked up by media outlets. In this paper, we present a supervised learning model to classify coalition signals in newspaper articles. The method identifies segments of text in which an affiliate of one party rules out or promotes a coalition with another party. We evaluate our approach based on hand-coded newspaper articles in Germany and Austria and validate the method based on pre-electoral coalitions in state elections. Both applications reveal the advantages of our method over existing dictionary approaches. Research can use our approach when interested in identifying targeted party elite communication about a specific subject in newspaper articles.	Political Communications
2021	0448	467	Explaining the Variation in Individuals' Conspiratorial Beliefs: The Effect of Exposure to Emotive Conspiratorial Messaging in the Media	Why do some people believe in political conspiracy theories and others do not? Why, for instance, do 60 per cent of Americans believe that the CIA killed President John F. Kennedy while 25 per cent believe that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States? What factors contribute to some theories becoming popular and others not? To date, the literature has largely focused on the demographic and psychological characteristics that explain individuals' belief in political conspiracy theories. This paper proposes that an important yet overlooked factor influencing individuals’ perceptions of political conspiracy theories is their exposure to these theories through negative emotive frames. The use of negative emotive language in conspiratorial messaging is noted in the literature. However, a thorough investigation into the effect that emotive language has in the development of conspiratorial beliefs has yet to be undertaken. Thus, an understanding of the presence of these emotions and their impact is lacking. Through the use of a framing experiment, this paper demonstrates that exposure to a conspiracy increases an individual's likelihood to believe that theory. Further, if this exposure is through a negative emotive frame this relationship is strengthened.	Political Communications
2021	0402	38	Repost and Like: Securitization Theory in the Digital Age	Securitization theory has long aimed to explain how security problems come into existence. Yet, limited by the notion that security is only articulated in an institutional voice by the elites (Wæver 1995:57), the modern processes of securitization encouraged by the proliferation of social media have been understudied. Contending that securitization develops in non-institutional online spheres like Twitter, this article develops a processual refinement that reconceptualizes the production of (in)security as an activity of connecting (Mützel 2009) and depicts securitization as the process of constructing networked structures of meaning. The study explores this puzzle using a text-as-data approach to analyse over 10 million Twitter messages shared by five actor groups in the months leading up to the 45th G7 summit: politicians and governmental institutions, the media, advocates, politicians' Twitter friends, and citizens on Twitter. After developing a securitization-desecuritization dictionary, the study employs a semi-supervised semantic scaling model to position each tweet on a unidimensional scale and identify the securitizing moves and agents. The study then traces the chain of associations between securitizing actors and performs social network analyses to discover the evolutional steps of the formation process of (in)security. The results demonstrate that securitization develops on Twitter as networks of repeated, mundane, routinized, and banal securitizing acts produced by elite and non-elite actors. Moreover, the study reveals that quantitative text analysis and social network analysis tools are instrumental in producing reliable indicators of securitization.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0403	594	When are blame games effective? How blame and source effects shape citizens’ acceptance of EU sanctions against democratic backsliding	Although democracy and the rule of law belong to the basic criteria for accession to the European Union, democratic norms have recently been eroding in several member states. In reaction, many politicians and scholars demand more effective instruments to sanction the violation of democratic standards. However, others argue that such measures could lead to unintended backlash effects, when governments in the affected countries convince their domestic audiences that EU actions are an illegitimate intervention into domestic affairs. In this paper, therefore, we shed light on whether and under what conditions domestic audiences would support EU sanctions against their own country for failing to comply with norms of democracy and the rule of law. First, we argue that citizens should become less likely to support EU sanctions if their government defends itself, especially so if it seeks to shift the blame to the EU (blame effect). Second, this effect may be moderated by which actor identifies and claims the norm violation (source effect). The more citizens perceive the actor who makes the allegations as independent and legitimate, the more likely they are to accept sanctions against their own country and the less influential the blame effect should become. We test our expectations by conducting a survey experiment in the six EU member states Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Hungary, and Poland (n=12,000). Our preliminary results corroborate our theoretical expectations. The findings imply that the EU should work towards a sanctioning mechanism that anticipates the blaming strategies of affected member state governments.	EU Politics
2021	0435	200	Defenders of democracy? How democratic attitudes relate to political participation	Recent incidents of democratic backsliding have brought renewed attention to the significance of citizens’ views of and attitudes towards democracy for the stability of democratic regimes. Yet, while political-culture research typically places great importance on citizens’ democratic attitudes, we know little about how democratic attitudes contribute to protecting democracy. Although the protection of democracy may rest on citizens actually acting upon their (democratic) attitudes, few studies have examined how democratic attitudes relate to political behavior. Our contribution is therefore interested in examining the relationship between democratic attitudes and political behavior. Prior research has shown that democratic attitudes typically relate to increased political participation, but these studies have not taken into account the regime context: how do variations in democratic quality affect the relationship between democratic attitudes and political behavior? Distinguishing between institutionalized and non-institutionalized political participation, we suggest diverging effects: On the one hand, in high-quality democracies, we expect citizens to express their democratic attitudes primarily through formal political participation as they conceive the democratic process as the primary means to participate in politics. In contrast, in low-quality democracies, we expect citizens with more democratic attitudes to engage primarily in informal political participation as they may find formal political participation to be a less and less viable venue to express their political preferences and to increasingly see the need for protest action. Combining survey data from the World Values Survey and European Values Study (2017-2020) with data from the V-Dem project, we test these hypotheses for democracies around the world.

2021	0449	246	The Activation of Norms – Revisiting the Link between Citizenship Norms and Participation	Liberal democracies are under pressure around the globe. They are challenged by populist and authoritarian actors and movements who question and erode democratic norms. Against this backdrop, democracies depend particularly on the support and the actual participation of citizens in democratic and societal processes. To explain participation, this paper focuses on the role of citizenship norms. It asks under which circumstances citizens act upon their normative conceptions of a ‘good citizen’. I argue that it matters how strongly and how uniformly this norm is shared in the context. Strong prevalence and strong consensus about the norm to vote are expected to activate this norm and to promote actual participation in elections. In these circumstances, citizens will feel social pressure to show conforming behavior. This argument is empirically tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) 2014 and applying hierarchical modelling techniques. The results lend support to the theoretical expectations: higher norm prevalence strengthens the link between the individual norm and participation while a higher variance weakens it. This informs us about ways to promote political participation as normatively desirable behavior.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0419	160	Who cares? Conceptions of what democracy means and acquisition to democratic backsliding in Germany and Poland	Recent literature has highlighted a particular challenge to the stability of democracy: While citizens in democracies rarely vote ‘against democracy’, they often acquiesce to anti-democratic policies due to long-established loyalties, their satisfaction with the government and its policies or identity-based double standards. However, research has also shown widespread support for democracy among the citizenry of the same democracies. We wonder, why do citizens acquiesce to democratic backsliding, even though they claim that democracy is important to them? To answer this question, we conduct a nationally representative online survey experiment with 700 respondents from Germany and Poland, each. We show that citizens are most likely to acquiesce to democratic backsliding that affects features of democracy which are not crucial to their conception of what democracy means. We furthermore assess the impact of citizens' satisfaction with democracy on their willingness to tolerate democratic backsliding by their preferred governments. Our research has implications for both practitioners who want to increase the stability of democracies as well as researchers who are working on democratic backsliding and political support in democratic systems.

2021	0404	654	Asylum and Policy Response in the UK and Germany	(I am sorry for my late submission, I noticed today that I even missed the extended deadline, but I would be very grateful if you would consider my paper for inclusion in your conference) The relationship between public opinion and immigration policy remains unclear. Despite increasing supranational constraints, government responsiveness is apparent at the national level, though previous research on this subject has often failed to account for seasonality or the ways in which preferences interact with salience. To investigate the drivers of these national variations, I turn to the specific case of asylum seekers in EU countries. As the number of displaced people continues to rise globally, this form of immigration is likely to be a contentious area of policymaking for years to come. Using asylum data together with preference and salience surveys, I apply time series methods to compare the opinion-policy link in the UK and Germany from 2002 to the present. Initial results show signs of responsiveness in both countries, largely positive in Germany and negative in the UK, with each indicating something of a thermostatic relationship between opinion and policy. By comparing the two countries and disaggregating the data according to group characteristics, I also examine the role of specific public preferences, institutional variations, and interest groups as possible explanatory factors for these different outcomes.

2021	0450	442	Prejudice, the Rule of Law and Support for Immigration Enforcement	In the last decade, Western liberal democracies have displayed an appetite for openly draconian immigration enforcement. Supporters of such policies maintain that they are keen to welcome legal migrants, regardless or their background or origin, but that strict enforcement measures are necessary to deter lawbreaking and maintain justice. And yet, it is also plausible that such policies are implicitly tolerated because racial minorities - rather than White or wealthy migrants -- bear the brunt of the costs. There is an extensive body of research on the role of prejudice in anti-immigrant attitudes, and there is empirical evidence that individuals place a great deal of emphasis of a migrant's legal status. Yet, empirical literature has never tested whether or not the legal justification for enforcement holds water against the backdrop of prejudice. We test the extent to which deference to authority and racism drive enforcement preferences in the United Kingdom. We examine preferences on the targets of enforcement through an original conjoint experiment and then analyze how racism and deference to authority shape the ethical concessions individuals are willing to make in the name of enforcement. We find that, in the absence of prejudice, the values of obedience and deference to authority will not drive individuals to support excessive or unfair enforcement tactics. Rather, such harshness -- while often justified in terms of justice and legality -- is fundamentally driven by prejudice.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0420	195	Global norms, regional practices: Taste-based vs. statistical discrimination in German asylum decision making	Macro-political studies have uncovered vast spatial differences in the acceptance ratios of asylum-seekers in the European Union, the United States and within countries such as Germany or Switzerland. Although discrimination is a likely cause of this inequity, we do not know whether prejudice against certain applicant groups or insufficient information about the individual requests explain the troubling patterns. Distinguishing between two classic models of discrimination, this article examines based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP-Survey of Refugees in Germany the individual chance of asylum-seekers to receive the status of a refugee or to obtain other forms of protection. Theories of taste-based discrimination suggest that extra-legal factors such as public opinion or the ethnic identity of an asylum-seeker influence the decision on an application. The concept of statistical discrimination, conversely, advances the belief that increased information on an application helps the decision makers to overcome their tendency to rely on ethnic markers or other stereotypes when evaluating a file. We evaluate in this vein whether the reasons given for the asylum application or a desperate political situation in the country of origin increase the chance of protection. The empirical examination lends support to both claims and shows that extra-legal factors affect the initial decision to grant protection as well as appeals against these rulings. Our results raise concerns regarding Germany’s self-conception as a state under the rule of law as its asylum enforcement is largely determined by regional interests, thereby systematically violating the principle of equality before the law.

2021	0436	407	After the arrivals: How responses to asylum seekers differ in rural and urban areas	Research has increasingly attempted to uncover the mechanisms of hostility and hospitality towards refugees in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. There seems to have emerged a unanimity that mere exposure to asylum seekers and refugees increases hostility in natives, but more and more research points in the direction that prolonged contact between natives and refugees increases hospitality, in line with the contact hypothesis. However, the literature is inconclusive about when and where contact happens. I argue that levels of urban density are an important confounder when it comes to measuring contact: refugee arrivals are more visible in a village than in a city, and this fact is likely to determine the level of exposure to refugees among natives. This paper tests this assumption by running an original block sampled survey in Finland among rural and urban dwellers who as-if-randomly either witnessed or did not witness asylum seekers' arrivals in their municipality. Results show that reactions to asylum seekers are more favorable in rural areas than in cities and this spills over to favorable attitudes to immigration in general. Contact, economic interests, and lower levels of crime in rural areas all contribute to these differences.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0421	333	The State-First Argument: Novel Evidence with a Novel Measure of State Capacity	State capacity has become an important concept in many social science subfields and comparative quantitative cross-national literature on the topic is proliferating especially in studies at the intersection of political and economic research. A large body of literature has analysed the role of state capacity for democratisation and democratic development, but an effective empirical testing of various theories on the topic requires better quantifications of state capacity. In fact, scholars have plenty of measurements to choose from, but most of them lack in validity and analytical ability. Poor measurements stand in the way of accumulating knowledge on state capacity. This paper presents a novel cross-national measurement of state capacity and provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between state capacity and democracy. Hence, the paper contributes both to the so called “sequencing literature” and to the literature on measurement issues regarding state capacity. Through a comparison with other measurements, this study shows that the novel measurement is more valid than many established measurements of state capacity, providing more robustness to the following longitudinal analysis on the relationship between state capacity and democracy. The findings on the latter show that state capacity is an important and positive predictor of democracy, promoting the “state first argument”. The establishment of successful democracies can be enhanced by building up more capable state institutions.	Comparative Politics
2021	0405	154	Measuring Political Ideology – A Meta-scientific account	Political ideologies are foundational to a broad range of social science fields such as Political Science, and Social and Political Psychology. Ideologies aid individuals navigate the complex socio-political world by offering an organization of values, justifying social arrangements, and explaining power relations. While scholars use diverse and wide-ranging approaches, all have in common the measurement of an individual’s political ideology. We sought to investigate this practice for which we conducted an exhaustive literature review of over 400 scientific articles, spanning from the 1930s to 2020s, across a wide range of social sciences’ subfields. We found and catalogued more than 60 unique ideological instruments measuring the same construct: ideology. However, validity evidence such as statistical/psychometric technique, extraction and rotation method were sparingly reported, with only a few studies reporting more than one type of criteria.We found a high frequency of incomplete reporting of the items used, and substantial variance in scoring and scale type -even within seemingly identical scales (e.g., Wilson & Patterson's C-scale).About half of published ideological instruments failed to provide any validation evidence in its favor, and from the remaining, only a third had reported being developed or validated.Results show that most ideological instruments were either on-the-fly measures or an ad-hoc combination of items present in existing, publicly available surveys. Our research suggests the literature isn't transparent about the measures it uses, and it's not conducive to replication attempts.These characteristics preclude the accumulation of scientific knowledge, and likely pose a serious threat to the comparability and generalizability of published findings.

2021	0437	646	Measurement Error and Bias in the Study of Intergovernmental Organizations	Research on intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) has progressed considerably over the past twenty years. Much of this progress was enabled by what has become one of the most widely used datasets on IGOs, the Correlates of War (COW) Project’s data on IGOs. Like most large-n datasets, the COW IGO data is not without limitations. It includes organizations that do not meet the requirements for inclusion as cases of IGOs in light of the dataset’s stipulated criteria. In addition, basic IGO characteristics, such as start and end dates, as well as whether IGOs are independent of other organizations, and thus unique observations, are often coded inconsistently and in ways not supported by available evidence. These inaccuracies introduce measurement error and potential bias in analyses that use these data to generate dependent and independent variables of interest, such as IGO creation, state membership in IGOs, and co-membership of two states in IGOs. In this paper, we introduce new data that allows researchers to identify and correct several coding inaccuracies in the COW IGO data. We identify the most common inaccuracies and relate them to theoretical debates in the study of IGOs, including IGO death and informal governance. We also indicate the utility of the new data by demonstrating how established results are affected when using the new data. Overall, the data is intended to complement, not replace, the COW IGO data and, in doing so, contribute to a more accurate understanding of IGOs and how they shape world politics.

2021	0504	319	When the State and Church Clash: Political Legacies of Religious Repression in Nazi Germany	There is a burgeoning literature across the social sciences examining the legacy of violence on political behavior. Most studies are focused on the long-term effects of individual or family victimization. In this paper, we examine the legacy of violence that selectively targets community elites. Inspired by theoretical literature on identity formation and transmission we hypothesize that elites play an important independent role in shaping political values and beliefs. To empirically test this argument we study the aftereffects of Nazi-era repression of Catholic parish priests in Germany's Bavaria. We construct a dataset of priest repression and, hypothesizing that especially activist priests were ones that had been targeted by state authorities, ask whether repression of activist priests in the 1930s is associated with higher vote for the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavaria's Catholic party, in post-war elections. We find a strong and persistent association between Nazi-era repression of Catholic clergy and post-war vote for the CSU. Nazi repression signaled the quality of activist priests who forged beliefs consistent with political Catholicism and also catalyzed priest activism by juxtaposing authoritarian Nazi ideology against the Catholic value-system. Our findings suggest that violence shapes political behavior via mechanisms other than only direct victimization.	Comparative Politics
2021	0457	110	Elite Control of Religious Institutions: Evidence from Denmark	We study whether elite ownership of religious property had an effect on electoral power of the conservative elites. We use the case of Denmark, where church buildings were private property, usually of local landed estate owners, until a reform in 1903. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we show that after the 1903 reform, where traditional estate owners lost control of Church property, the conservative party lost electoral support in constituencies that formerly had many estate-owned churches. These findings suggest that religious legitimacy and control of religious institutions played an important role in shoring up support for the old elite in the early days of competitive elections.

2021	0473	278	The Transformation of Religious Cleavages in European Democracies: A Comparative Analysis	Of all socio-demographic factors, religion is one of the most important determinants of voting behavior. The secularization of Western societies, however, has changed impact of religion on electoral behavior. While secularization limits the political relevance of religion it also affects the nature of religious cleavages. As evidence from the United States suggests, a decrease of denominational differences goes hand in hand with an increased relevance of religiosity. As a result, a divide between the secular sections of the society and a cross-denominational “coalition of the religious” has emerged (Putnam and Campbell 2012). In this paper, we examine whether this change also occurs in Europe. Our analysis relies on survey data from all currently available nine waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) covering the period from 2002 to 2018. We compare the explanatory power of different measures of religion in models of vote choice, with a focus on the contrast between religious denomination and religiosity, where we consider both subjective measures, such as self-reported religiosity, and measures based on overt behavior, such as church attendance. Combining ESS data with data on parties’ political positions from the Manifesto Project and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), allows us to go beyond conventional approaches that rely on a pre-determined classification of parties into party families and to take into account the dynamics of party competition instead.

2021	0488	470	The dialogue paradox: Assessing interfaith and intercultural dialogue as a policy tool in Europe	Interfaith and intercultural dialogue has emerged as an important policy tool in many European countries. Policy-makers have attempted to make use of dialogue as a way of increasing social cohesion. But in spite of the prevalence of such initiatives, there have been few empirical investigations of these policies. This study looks into when dialogue acitivities can have an effect, and when they can backfire. The main claim is that dialogue can indeed lead to a deeper change than other forms of interaction. Dialogue allows participants to change their thinking, without this being felt as a threat to one's self-image or autonomy. But if dialogue becomes too instrumentalized as a policy tool the participants may feel that the dialogue is done with the aim of controlling them, and the dialogue will no longer work. This is the dialogue paradox. These claims are tested by looking at the Norwegian case, and the dialogue between The Islamic Council of Norway and other actors in society. The Islamic Council of Norway is the main representative umbrella organization for mosques in Norway, and has been involved in dialogue activities since the early 1990s. It has also been involved in controversies, where it was asked by outside actors to take stands on contested issues. Using within-case comparison, I show that dialogue often made the Islamic Council change their stances, whereas debate from the outside did not achieve this. But in the latest period, dialogue became perceived as a governing tool, and therefore stopped having an effect.	Comparative Politics
2021	0489	402	Legislative Informational Lobbying	Whom should an interest group lobby in a legislature? I develop a model of informational lobbying in which a legislature must decide on the allocation of district-specific goods and projects. An interest group chooses sequentially to search and provide information on districts' valuations of the goods. The setting is one of distributive politics with a legislative allocation proposal which is endogeneous to the information provided by the interest group. I characterize the equilibrium search sequence of the interest group, and identify two empirical and institutional implications of the analysis. First, the model rationalizes both friendly and confrontational lobbying, predicting circumstances in which friendly lobbying prevails over confrontational lobbying. Second, the model establishes a relationship between information provision and legislative majority requirement, offering a contrast between the optimal majority requirement if legislators seek to maximize the information they receive versus the monetary contributions they receive.

2021	0458	207	Strategic and Sequential Links between Campaign Donations and Lobbying	We offer the first large-scale analysis of the direct link between campaign donations and lobbying — two distinct political activities that have been mostly studied separately. Using over 75 million U.S. federal lobbying reports and campaign contribution filings since 1999, we show that interest group donations are directly related to their subsequent lobbying efforts and the legislative activities of the targeted politicians. To analyze this sequential link, we use difference-in-differences estimation combined with matching, comparing firms that donate to a politician against a set of comparable firms with no donation history to the same politician. We find that donations result in an 8.5 to 10 percentage point increase in the probability that the targeted politician engages in legislative activities related to the bills lobbied by the donating firm. The estimated effects are large, short-term, and particularly pronounced for committeerelated activities. Our findings question the common perception of donations as driven either by ideology or long-term investment strategy of interest groups.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0474	508	Ask, And You Shall Receive - Strategic Information Transmission in the Public Consultation Procedure of the European Commission	The European Commission heavily depends on information from different interest groups when drafting policies. A major tool to get information about policy consequences are public consultations. However, interest groups can choose how much information to provide in their consultation submissions. Building on interviews with members of different directorate generals and interest groups, I developed a formal model to show that interest groups condition the amount of information they provide in consultations on the prior knowledge of the Commission. When the Commission has precise knowledge about possible consequences of policies, information barely affects the final policy proposal, and interest groups decide to invest less in information provision. Therefore, interest coalitions, interest groups with similar preferences, decide to send less informative signals to the Commission. When the commission has less precise beliefs, new information is an effective lobbying tool. Interest groups individually invest in providing new information, leading to more informative signals and more information aggregation in consultations. Using quantitative text analysis, I show that the similarity of submissions by different interest groups from the same lobbying coalition depends on the amount of information that the Commission has prior to the consultation. The less prior information the Commission has, the more information can be aggregated in consultations.	EU Politics
2021	0515	237	When do voters learn from foreign experiences? Evidence from Brexit	In the last decades a backlash against the institutions of international cooperation has challenged the liberal world order. While most scholars have analyzed the sources of such a backlash, we do not much about the responses it has generated among the public. This is an important question to understand whether instances of international disintegration generate reinforcing dynamics or pushbacks. This paper analyzes how German voters have responded to the Brexit negotiations, and in particular it asks whether and under what conditions Eurosceptic voters have moderated their support for an EU-exit in light of the struggles of the British government. First, based on a diff-in-diff design that exploits random variation in exposure to information, we provide causal evidence of the existence of cross-national learning. Second, based on the analysis of two panel surveys, we study variation in learning effects. We focus on the interaction between two sources of resistance to discordant information, strength of prior beliefs and strength of partisanship, and we show that the prevalence of one source of resistance over the other provides different incentives for party strategies. Our findings expand theories of public opinion on international affairs, contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of voter learning, and have implications for the study of party behavior in a changing environment.

2021	0476	353	Mind the Gap: Why Wealthy Voters Support Brexit	Wealth provides a cushion against financial risk. We argue that wealth-based insurance can therefore alter status quo support beyond what a simple cost-benefit calculation would suggest. We test our theory in the case of Brexit, which has been widely characterized as a vote by economically left-behind voters. Our results show that individuals who preferred Brexit -- but who also lacked individual wealth -- are less likely to support leaving the EU. We corroborate our theory using two large independent surveys with similar wealth measures, accounting for unobserved individual level heterogeneity, and using a survey experiment. The findings have important implications for the role of wealth-as-insurance in electoral behavior, as well as for understanding the Brexit case.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0490	426	Divorcing the European Union? Examining the Use of Metaphors in Public Debate about Brexit	News headlines on the 24th of June, 2016, announced of a ‘historic divorce’ set to happen when reporting on the Brexit referendum results. Since then, media references to divorce negotiations, divorce proceedings and divorce settlement have become part of the common discourse. Family metaphors, however, are nothing new in political language: there are ‘founding fathers’, ‘brotherly nations’, ‘party families’, ‘Mutter Merkel’ to name a few. Yet, there is little research on how and why these metaphors are used in the public debate. This article aims to address the gap in the literature by collecting novel data on the use of divorce-metaphor in relation to Brexit in British and international news sources, following the Brexit referendum. We apply a mixed-method approach to investigate how frequently divorce references are made in different types of sources, who are making these references and what is the broader meaning as well as implication of discussing Brexit as a ‘divorce’.

2021	0459	274	Learning from Precedent: How the British Brexit Experience Counteracts Nationalism outside the UK	Following the rising popularity of nationalist parties in Western democracies, international institutions have witnessed an increase in animosities and withdrawals. Brexit arguably marks the most significant instance of this phenomenon to date. A growing literature examines the origins of nationalist successes such as the Brexit vote and explores if similar economic, social, and political conditions could fuel equivalent disintegration processes elsewhere. However, less is known about the extent to which such withdrawal episodes themselves affect nationalist demands for reducing their countries’ international commitments in other countries. In this paper, we argue that large-scale disintegration episodes such as Brexit provide new information about the feasibility and desirability of nationalist policies. Hence, these episodes are likely to affect partisan discourse about similar nationalist projects in other countries: Depending on the success of such precedents, nationalists abroad will either be encouraged or deterred to follow a similar disintegration path. Thus, we expect nationalists in other countries to learn from these precedents. We explore this argument based on a quantitative text analyses of media reports in selected European countries. Our results show that nationalists in Europe significantly moderated their demands as the Brexit-drama unfolded, especially as the difficulties associated with leaving the EU became increasingly obvious. This suggests that Brexit indeed provides a reality check for nationalist pro-Leave arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for Western democracies and international institutions more generally.	EU Politics
2021	0506	539	Brexit, Critical Junctures, and Endogenous Institutional Change	It is well established that European Union (EU) membership and European integration produce path-dependent dynamics. In path dependence (PD) with increasing returns, change is triggered by an external crisis that destroys the existing institutional structure. This exogenous shock opens a critical juncture (CJ), during which a new institutional arrangement is adopted. In light of the historical institutionalist (HI) literature on institutional change, Brexit presents a puzzle: Why would a Member State leave the EU if membership engenders path-dependent dynamics? How can a Member State extricate itself from such complex and long-standing institutional structure in the absence of an exogenous shock? This article examines Brexit through the historical institutionalist literature on institutional change, focusing especially on the critical juncture scholarship. It uses process tracing to analyze Brexit as a temporal process unfolding between 2009 and 2020. The article makes two theoretical contributions. First, it generates new theoretical insights about institutional reform and advances the critical juncture concept. Second, by linking the literature on institutional change with the emerging Brexit scholarship, it also adds theoretical rigor to the latter.	EU Politics
2021	0475	572	Let them eat pie: addressing the partial contestation problem in multiparty electoral contests	Although most scholars acknowledge that district-level election results are compositional variables, few model them as such. Instead, they tend to model the shares of single parties across districts, because of partial contestation (situations where not all parties field candidates in every electoral district). We advance the current framework on the compositional modelling of electoral contestation to include a sample-selection approach similar to Heckman’s and an intuitive approach that involves explicitly controlling for whether a party contests a particular district. We test these approaches against established compositional approaches using both simulated and real-world data.	Political Methodology
2021	0491	153	A Systematic Assessment of Ideological Measures: An empirical analyses	Measures of political ideologies are foundational to a broad range of scholarship in social sciences. Ensuring an accurate measurement of an individual’s political proclivities is of utmost importance to the credibility of published results within Political Psychology. However, as political psychological phenomena are mostly latent – in that the constructs of interest are not directly observable – its measurement requires appropriate psychometric development and validation. The lack thereof may affect the verity of reported findings as well as its replicability. With the recent surge in interest in politico-psychological research, instruments intending to gauge one’s location on the ideological space abound in the marketplace. But while producing multiple instruments for the same construct may be convenient, it is unlikely that they are all equally valid indicators of ideological content. Also, the vast majority of appraised studies utilized on the fly measures, small N, and student or convenient samples. Importantly, it is a standard practice to assume ideological inventories can be used interchangeably. This untested assumption, if shown not to hold, may pose a threat to the comparability and generalizability of findings. Despite these drawbacks, there is not as of yet a study assessing the comparability, replicability and validity of ideological instruments, and this study aims to fill this gap.	Political Methodology
2021	0514	73	Challenging the predominant measurement approach: presenting new measurement instruments for both nationalism and patriotism	In empirical scholarship, measurement scales for both nationalism and patriotism built on pride-item-batteries are broadly established. Despite their widespread usage, they are marked by several empirical shortcomings. Pride, so the tenor of criticism, is a highly ambiguous and therefore problematic concept when measuring national attitudes. However, systematically developing and testing new indicators has received considerably little attention in previous scholarship. The merit of this contribution lies in filling this gap by presenting new measurement instruments for both patriotism and nationalism. In contrast to the prevailing research tradition, these measures do not adhere to the contested pride-item-concept and seek to properly tap the complexity of both nationalism and patriotism. Elements that have largely been missing in the previous approach such as the divergent primary objects of allegiance both kinds of national attitude are defined by are explicitly taken into account. Based on an online survey in Germany starting in autumn 2020, the new items are evaluated by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The paper thus provides a new approach that better reflects these national attitudes currently dominating the political landscape in Europe but also in other Western countries.	Political Methodology
2021	0505	214	The (real) need for a human touch: Testing a human-machine hybrid topic classification workflow on a New York Times corpus	The classification of the items of ever-increasing textual databases has become an important goal for a number of research groups active in the field of comparative politics (see, for instance, the Comparative Agendas Project – CAP). Although trained human classifiers are still the gold standard for most policy topic labelling projects such as CAP, there is a growing number of use-cases where the initial effort of human classifiers was successfully augmented through the use of supervised machine learning (SML) based classification. In this paper we investigate such a hybrid workflow solution classifying the lead paragraphs of New York Times front page articles from 1996 to 2006 according to the CAP policy categories. We find that using human coding and validation combined with an ensemble SML hybrid approach can reduce the need for human coding while maintaining very high precision rates, and offering a modest to good level of recall. The modularity of this hybrid workflow allows for various setups to address the idiosyncratic resource bottlenecks that a large-scale text classification project might face.	Political Methodology
2021	0460	263	The Core of the Party System	A core party is undefeated in pair-wise majority preference comparisons against all other political parties. We use CSES survey self-reported voter preferences data and moment inequalities testing methods to identify potential core and Condorcet winner parties. We carry out tests for 1,168 parties over 195 election surveys. We cannot reject the hypothesis of a core party in nearly half the tests, while we cannot reject the hypothesis that a party is a Condorcet winner in only about 7.36% of tests. We relate the incidence of apparent core parties to party-specific observables; and find that parties that pass the core test are over 25% more likely to participate in a post-election government, even when controlling for common predictors of inclusion in the cabinet.

2021	0477	420	Can I stay or must I go? Cabinet replacement in Africa	In African states, there is a lot of fluctuation in cabinets. Large structural changes such as leader changes or changes in ethnic representation only explain a fraction of those. Why do leaders decide to replace ministers so frequently? The literature on authoritarian regimes assumes that autocratic leaders need to strategically balance their ruling coalitions. African leaders use cabinet placement to co-opt potential rivals. We argue that once new threats emerge, leaders need to decide which of the current ministers are least important for regime survival and can be replaced. We test whether ministers from overrepresented ethnic groups, ministers that serve only since a short time and women are most likely to be considered replaceable to make space for the co-optation of new potential rivals. To do so, we use monthly data on cabinet composition in 23 African countries between 1996 and 2017.	Comparative Politics
2021	0461	338	The Spurious Relationship between Party Leader Resignations and their Votes	In the literature, party leadership changes have been treated as a binary measure. The classic story is a party leader steps down following poor electoral performance as a means to realign the party with voters. We challenge this assumption that party leadership is binary and argue that it is not always preceded by electoral loss. For instance, Olof Palme, the leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, was assassinated in 1986, which could not have been predicted by the 1985 election. On the other hand, Ed Miliband, leader of the UK Labour Party, resigned shortly after the 2015 election as a result of Labour’s poor performance. In the case of Palme, there is no apparent link between the previous election and his end of leadership whereas in the case of Miliband, there is a strong link. We look at the relationship between electoral loss and party leadership change by using a novel dataset of leadership changes in advanced industrial democracies from 1960-2020. We find that electoral loss should only precede leadership resignations for reasons of electoral loss or intra-party factionalization, not for natural transitions, such as health reasons or caretakers. We conclude that leadership change is indeed not a binary concept- it is multifaceted and has a spurious relationship with previous electoral loss.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0492	224	Cabinet reshuffles: how bad are they for expertise and policy?	An unresolved debate in the literature is whether and how cabinet reshuffles affect policy. On the one hand, ministerial changes allow the prime minister to control her/his cabinet ministers reducing agency losses. In this case, more frequent reshuffles could lead to fewer ministers treating their departments as personal fiefdoms and therefore, to lower departmental spending and government deficit. On the other hand, ministerial changes, that can serve multiple political and non-policy related reasons, could prevent the accumulation of ministerial policy expertise leading to either poor policy outcomes or the dominance of civil servants over the government. In this case, depending on the quality of the bureaucracy, we might find that higher frequency in cabinet reshuffles leads to lower economic growth and higher deficits. Using data on the political and educational profiles of cabinet ministers in key economic portfolios and data on bureaucratic quality, we test these competing hypotheses in a sample of 18 parliamentary democracies over 60 years. With the aid of these data, we are able to directly test the effect of ministerial tenure in core economic portfolios on economic growth and government debt and deficit, controlling for ministerial expertise and government duration. Our findings have important implications regarding the role of ministerial reshuffles on economic governance.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration

The empirical evidence concerning the populist contagion has remained inconclusive, however, and the burgeoning literature has so far focused predominantly on electoral performance as the focus of inquiry, political parties as the unit of analysis, election manifestos as the data source, and a priori identification of cases.This study sets out to revisit the theoretical arguments on populist contagion beyond the party-political sphere while questioning the alleged linear (continuously growing) and one-directional (from populist towards non-populist) pattern of contagion. Instead of portraying the alleged populists as the doer and the non-populists as the done-to and postulating a linear increase of populism, it asserts that the complex processes, which eventually lead to more populism in the parliament, might be reciprocal or even symbiotic.The study takes on the ideational conceptual approach and depicts populism as a thin-centered ideology with two fundamental constitutive components: people-centrism and anti-elitism. Following a case study design and using the textual data from the Prime Minister’s Questions sessions, it measures the level of populist discourse at individual and aggregate levels. Doing so, the study generates a novel data-set that provides insights into the establishment or consolidation of populist sentiments among the members of parliament and reveals the temporal trends in the House of Commons for over a twenty-year period.

2021	0516	315	The electoral implications of minority cabinets	Does supporting a minority cabinet hurt a party electorally? Even though minority governments have become more and more frequent in recent years, little is known about the electoral implications of parties under minority cabinets. We argue that acting as a support party of a minority government allows parties to achieve important policy goals while not having to suffer from electoral losses that typically come with joining cabinets as junior coalition partners. While support parties obtain policy payoffs in selected policy areas in exchange for their parliamentary support, they can avoid electoral punishment as they are not formally part of the government. In order to test our theoretical argument, we have compiled a novel and comprehensive dataset on the electoral performance of more than 200 political parties running in 196 elections in 27 countries from 1980 until 2019. Using a differences-in-differences estimation strategy, we estimate the causal effect of minority support party status on subsequent electoral performance. Our findings shed important light on the relationship between minority governments and electoral competition in times of increasing party system fragmentation.	Comparative Politics
2021	0030	544	De-Commemoration Policies and the Formation of Public Opinion	Monuments and symbols are often employed to legitimize political systems. Consequently, authoritarian symbology is a frequent target after democratic transitions, whose removal represents a break with a past that is not anymore deemed as acceptable. How do these de-commemoration policies affect public opinion? We take advantage of the Spanish Historical Memory Law 52/2007 to assess the effects of removing authoritarian symbology from public spaces due to policy prescription on the process of political socialization. Our particular case exploits the de-commemoration of the main pre-democratic symbol during Franco dictatorship—fascist Spain’s coat of arms—from an urban public high school. To do so, we will survey its approx. Three-hundred students aged over fifteen before and after the public works end. We will estimate the effect of the de-commemoration using a Difference-in-Differences setup by replicating the same fieldwork in two public high schools located in the same city. We further explore the mechanisms by observing whether consequences come from the de-commemoration itself or by informing subjects that this process is executed according to the Spanish Historical Memory law—policy prescription. We do so by incorporating a survey experiment in the second wave. This paper deepens to our understanding of the socialization dynamics in post-authoritarian democracies and provides empirical evidence to the debate of the consequences of de-commemoration policies.

2021	0004	179	Visual Europeanization? European Union Membership and Political Party Logos	Socialization to international norms has a symbolic and visual dimension. Even if Europeanization has long been understood as a process of norm diffusion, scholars have largely overlooked its visual dimension. In this article, we fill this gap by analysing the effect of EU membership on the most visible symbol of political parties: their logos. To that end, we analyse 747 party logos in three groups of countries: member states that joined the EU in or after 2004, candidate members, and Eastern Partnership (EP) states. Specifically, we looked at logos in four different moments: the two national elections before and after the membership, or the issuing of the candidate status, or 2004 for countries in the EP group. Then, we coded all logos for the presence/absence of nationalist, European, extreme ideologies and religious symbols, the country flag, and the colours of the flag. By employing logit and difference-in-differences models, we show that parties in countries that joined the EU often removed nationalist symbols from their logos after the membership, an effect largely absent for parties in candidate and EP countries. We demonstrate that this Visual Europeanization effect does not depend on other factors such as democratization or economic growth, and that descends from both population effects, namely the disappearance of old parties and the creation of new ones, and from existing parties’ rebranding strategies. Our findings contribute to the scholarship on visuality and norms, the domestic implications of European integration, party politics in Eastern Europe, and images-as-data approaches in Political Science.

2021	0017	579	The Power of Political Portraits: Evidence from a Chinese Survey Experiment	It is long argued that some people look more like leaders than others. But it is not systematically examined, nor is it clear whether such facial cues matter in real politics. We collected more than five thousand photos of local political consultative legislature members in China and then matched them into anonymous pairs that consisted of a politician and a nonpolitician, controlling for location, age, gender, smile, glass-wearing, etc. By doing several online survey experiments, we discover that: i) Chinese respondents are able to tell politicians from nonpoliticians by just looking at photo pairs. ii) Respondents trust and vote for politicians more than nonpoliticians. iii) Politicians are more likely to deter respondents from rebellious collective action or to induce them to accept an unfavorable offer. Further analyses demonstrate that our findings are stronger for local politicians with more detectable cues for politicians; such local politicians look more like senior Chinese leaders from the ruling communist party’s central committee. Our findings are robust to whether we use manually selected photo pairs or pairs that are selected with the help of AI-based image analysis techniques. Our research demonstrates that leader-like facial cues exist and matter in real politics.	Comparative Politics
2021	0493	393	Gendered Political Institutions: Understanding Female Legislators’ Experience of the Parliamentary Space and Their Behavioural Strategies	The descriptive representation of women in democracies has improved significantly in recent decades, however it varies between countries. Such representation was expected to contribute to greater societal gender equality, though it is unclear whether this is indeed the case. Part of the reason for this discrepancy is that in most established democracies the political system is still a patriarchal, male-dominated system characterized by the under-representation of women. In this context, female representatives are disadvantaged and need to adopt coping mechanisms and behavioural strategies to maximise their power and influence within gendered environment.Many studies focus on the behavioural outcomes of female representation in parliament, they often pay little attention to the underlying mechanisms explaining such behaviour. While there is some theorization regarding it, most studies do not focus on this issue. This study aims to uncover the behavioural strategies female legislators adopt in order to handle the unique challenges they face. Our data is based on in-depth interviews with approximately 25 past and present Israeli female legislators and employs a mixed-method approach. First, we will conduct a content analysis, followed by a qualitative interpretive reading of the interviews. This analytical strategy allows us to define and portray the power relations female legislators confront, and to map the practices and behavioural strategies they use. As a result it will contribute to our understanding of the way representative democracy operates in practice and identify the pitfalls hampering female legislators from bringing true gains for women.

2021	0462	229	When Do Women Voters See Themselves in Female Representatives?: Examining the Class Effects of Gender Gender Representation	Legislatures are dominated by wealthy, white-collar individuals, while the vast majority of the electorate are working-class. In particular, remarkably few women representatives in the US come from working-class backgrounds (less than 1%) while about 12\% of male representatives have working-class backgrounds. The severe underrepresentation of working-class women is because working-class women face double barriers, gender and class, to the development of political career. Working-class women are less endowed with financial resources and networks that enable their candidacy, compared to elite women. At the same time, differences in social roles give women, particularly working-class women, greater caregiving responsibilities, imposing greater constraints than working-class men. Why is it important to have more working-class women in political office? How can we improve the democratic norms and practices by electing more working-class women in office? Using survey experiments, this project answers these questions by (1) explaining how working-class women candidates might mobilize a broader support from the electorate thereby contributing to women's political power and (2) identifying electoral opportunities for working-class women candidates.

2021	0508	438	Mapping the policy space of public stakeholder consultations: Evidence from the European Union.	Public consultations with stakeholders have become a rich and important source of political and policy information that helps bureaucracies to strengthen their informational advantage and enhance their public reputation and legitimacy. Their informational quality depends however on the extent to which they provide useful and usable input. The complexity emerging from the number and diversity of participating stakeholders and issues can easily translate into cacophonous policy input with limited informational value. The structure of the policy space describing the aggregate patterns of stakeholders’ preferences is key to how consultations perform their function as channels of information transmission and venues of preference aggregation. We ask: what is the dimensionality of the policy space of stakeholder consultations and what explains it? We examine forty-two EC consultations organised with the help of online surveys. We find that despite a high variation in the number of stakeholders and issues included in consultations, most events are characterised by a low, two-dimensional policy space. Some consultations also present more than two dimensions. Across most consultations a knowledge dimension coexists with one or more policy substantive dimensions. We find mixed evidence about the effects of consultation design and stakeholders’ participation on the revealed dimensionality of the policy spaces. Our preliminary findings highlight the importance of better understanding the dimensionality of the policy space describing stakeholders’ participation in public policymaking in Europe and beyond. They have important implications for the role performed by public consultations as channels linking citizens, interest groups and bureaucratic decision-makers in public policymaking.	EU Politics

Prior theoretical research indicates that political elites and the Red Guards lost control of the social movement, and it evolved into sheer verbal violence and physical skirmishes across all provinces in the end (MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006; Walder 2009; Wang 1995). We show that in this political chaos, the Red Guards were conflicted internally and bi-polarizedly divided, attacking each other in self-printed propaganda, such as big-character posters (大字报 dazibao), tabloids (小报 xiao bao), and so on. Particularly, this paper analyzes the texts in the collection of these prints archived in Chinese Cultural Revolution Database. In this paper, we combine TextRank algorithm to extract key Chinese phrases, and the Poisson scaling model (Wordfish) as in Slapin and Proksch (2008) and Proksch and Slapin (2009) to estimate the differences of spatial positions using the extracted textual data covering the revolution. Results empirically extrapolate the inability of political elites to control mass movements, in alignment with the literature.	Comparative Politics
2021	0478	608	What's in a Dimension? The Western European Political Space from a Comparative Perspective	The structure of political conflict varies across Western Europe. Although the same general ideological dimensions structure politics in different contexts, which concrete policy issues are politicized relative to these dimensions—and in what degree—differs. We examine the associations between parties’ issue preferences and the underlying latent dimensions to assess how (dis)similar the meanings of political spaces are across Western European democracies. We do so by drawing on the expert-level responses of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) and a novel hierarchical Bayesian item response model that introduces variation across space in item parameters. Substantively, this allows us to (1) describe how similar countries’ political spaces are and how well specific issues travel across contexts, and (2) explore both structural and agent-based explanations for the (dis)similarity of Western European political spaces. This study has fundamental implications for our understanding of political ideology and party competition.	Comparative Politics
2021	0494	66	Does Intra-District Polarization Cause Party Polarization in Congress?	Does intra-district ideological heterogeneity cause party polarization in Congress? Instead of analyzing elite polarization and mass polarization separately, this study investigates the role of representational linkages between legislators and voters at the congressional district level. Specically, I examine how ideological distributions of district-level voters' preferences (the median voter's ideology and ideological heterogeneity) affect congressional candidates' policy position strategies during the election by using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). To demonstrate this, several scaling methods are used in combination. First, I utilize Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey (BAM) Scaling in order to recover common ideological space and to estimate the ideological positions of all congressional candidates from voters' perceptual data, which are comparable across districts. Second, item response theory (IRT) analysis on policy issues enables the recovery of constituencies' latent ideological dimensions. Third, representative values on district voters' ideological distributions are obtained in order to identify the characteristics of the geographic distribution of constituency preferences. Empirical results reveal that district ideological heterogeneity interacted with district median ideology, leading to ideologically extreme positioning and suggesting that the uncertainty regarding the voters' ideological preferences heightens polarization.

2021	0509	509	Participation or information? The who, what and why of the EU’s new ‘ubiquitous’ consultation regime	Faced with concerns about its democratic legitimacy and accountability, the European Commission recently expanded its stakeholder consultation regime to engage the public at every stage of its policy formulation and policy implementation processes, from roadmaps and inception impact assessments to legislative proposals and delegated and implementing acts. This procedural overhaul sought to increase the accessibility, transparency and interactivity of stakeholder consultations, while marshalling the information provided as feedback to improve the quality of decision-making. In this study, we unpick the heterogeneous aims of the EC’s new ‘ubiquitous’ consultation regime and ask whether the expansion of participation equates to the ideals of democratic fora or evidence-based policymaking. We develop a theoretical argument explaining how stakeholder consultations act as channels of participation and information provision in the context of bureaucratic policymaking. We employ a new dataset constructed from over 60,000 feedback responses provided by stakeholders between 2016 and 2019, across all EU policy areas to approximately 1,500 consultation events. We examine the patterns of stakeholder participation and using quantitative text analysis we estimate the informational value of stakeholders’ submission at consultation-event level. We construct two indexes capturing the participatory and informational quality of individual consultation events and with the help of cluster analysis we identify clusters of consultations based on the observed levels of stakeholder participation and the informational quality of their policy input. Our study provides valuable insights to key debates in the literatures on regulatory governance, democratic innovations and EU politics.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0495	252	Constraining the agency to please the public: the new mode of responsiveness in the EU.	Studies of the EU responsiveness often focus on the legislative output of the Union and its fluctuations in response to the changes in the support for the policy among various stakeholders. This paper takes a different route and analyses whether the demands of the domestic stakeholders affect the process of policy implementation. The EU decision-makers may respond to growing disillusionment with the EU by maintaining a tighter grip over policy implementation and constraining the discretionary power of the agency in charge. By constraining the extent of power delegated to the agency, the EU decision-makers minimize the prospective deviations from the policy measures agreed upon during the earlier stages of the policy-making process. The politicization of the policy area further strengthens the motivation of the principles to constrain the power of the agent to avoid the costs associated with the uncertainty of implementation within a contentious policy domain. The influence of politicization on the agency’s powers is accentuated when the supranational agent takes charge of the implementation process. The results of the paper may point towards a new mode of institutional responsiveness within the EU and flesh out how the domestic demands shape EU politics beyond the approval stage of the policymaking process. To test the expectations the paper relies on the novel dataset on the agency discretion in the EU and the data from the Eurobarometer surveys.	EU Politics
2021	0464	69	How Do European Citizens Form Their Views of the EU Public Administration? Exploring the Role of Heuristics	Complex multi-level governance systems face a variety of challenges. As one of the most prominent multi-level administrative systems, the EU has experienced a legitimacy crisis for several years, with many citizens displaying skeptical or even hostile views of European integration in general and the EU's central bureaucracy specifically. Although citizens often hold such negative views of the EU public administration, they have almost no direct interactions with or substantive knowledge of this institution. Given these circumstances, we ask: How do individual citizens form their views of the EU bureaucracy? Our theory suggests that citizens frequently use mental shortcuts, specifically the “representativeness heuristic,” to make inferences about the EU's administrative institutions. Empirically, we focus on the case of Romania and show that perceptions of domestic central and local bureaucracies are a significant predictor of perceptions of EU bureaucracies. These findings have wide-ranging academic and practical-political implications.	EU Politics
2021	0479	218	Polity, politics or policies? Voters’ political news preferences during European Parliament election campaigns	European Parliament elections are considered second-order elections, not least because participation and voting behaviour is often based on evaluations of the European Union (EU) polity, and seldom influenced by policy considerations. Prior research links these considerations to the availability of information during EU elections. This paper takes a step back and asks about what kind of information European voters prefer prior to Election Day. To investigate this, the paper conducts a secondary analysis of experimental data that were collected among 1,191 German respondents at the height of 2019 European Parliament election campaigns. The initial purpose of this survey was to study news preferences with respect to the personalization of politics. The study was pre-registered as such, which is why the present paper only engages in exploratory research. The survey was set up as a conjoint experiment, in which respondents were randomly exposed to several binary choice-sets of headlines featuring either the polity, politics, or policies. In addition, the headlines also varied in terms of subject (politicians/ parties/ institutions) and focus (national/ EU-level/ other European actors). The results suggest that news about politics was least preferred by respondents, while there were hardly any differences concerning the polity or policies. Yet, some respondent characteristics, including EU attitudes, left-right positions, political knowledge, and media trust, also influence preferences. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for scholarly debates concerning the role of information for political behaviour in EU politics.	EU Politics
2021	0465	413	From Parties to Leaders (and Back): Voting Behavior Patterns 60s-2020s	Elections are the core of the political process in democratic systems. How do people vote? The study of voting behavior has seen a shift from theories centered on social groups to theories centered on individuals. One of the most prominent expectations has been the individualization of politics, for which individuals (leaders) increased their importance for vote choice at the expense of groups (parties). However, empirical results provide little support for it. In this paper, I assemble the largest dataset ever used to analyze the relative importance of parties and leaders for voting behavior, spanning from 1961 to 2019 with more than 230,000 unique respondents. Furthermore, I propose a statistical model that controls for observed and unobserved heterogeneity at the country, election, and party levels.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0496	370	Electoral closeness and voter turnout: New evidence from European presidential elections	The closeness of electoral races has consistently been argued to increase voter turnout. Several studies have confirmed this finding by using double-ballot contests as a measure of ‘actual’ closeness between candidates or parties; yet, research has so far largely been limited to legislative elections and single country-studies. In this paper, we analyse the effects of electoral closeness on turnout differences in presidential elections and provide one of the first cross-national studies of this kind. We develop a modified model of turnout in presidential elections based on voter awareness and learning and test its propositions on a new data set covering all popular presidential elections in 16 European democracies, 1965-2020. Overall, we find that the first-round margin of closeness between leading candidates is associated with a significant increase in turnout; however, incumbents as frontrunners, presidential powers, and non-concurrent legislative elections prove to be more important predictors. Thereby, the results are stable for different operationalisations of the dependent and independent variables. We furthermore compare our findings with estimations based on pre-electoral polls; surprisingly, actual closeness between frontrunners in the first round performs better and inclusion of polling data into a combined model only marginally improves model fit. Our results offer new perspectives on voter turnout in semi-presidential democracies and contribute to scholarship on the political and institutional determinants of electoral behaviour.

2021	0480	19	Legislator Dissent and Electoral Outcomes	Voters seem to prefer having independent-minded legislative representatives in parliament. Indeed, an increasing number of studies report that people express significantly higher levels of support for legislators who vote against their party line. If this preference is reflected in voters' electoral behaviour, it could have important implications for modern democracies, where political parties need discipline to play their central role in delegation and accountability. This paper will provide a test for the hyphothesis that voters reward legislative dissent in elections. Specifically, we will test the effect of legislator dissent in the House of Commons on the UK general elections, on both aggregate- and individual-level outcomes. The former will draw on a dataset that covers the period between 1997 and 2019, bringing together observations from (a) MPs’ votes in six parliamentary terms and (b) electoral results in their constituency before and after these terms. We will complement this dataset with panel survey data on (c) their constituents’ electoral behaviour, which limits the beginning of the period to 2005 for individual-level analysis. Simple comparisons of electoral outcomes between those who do and do not dissent from their party line are likely to be misleading. There might be systematic differences between these two groups of people, and these differences might affect both legislative dissent and electoral outcomes. We will address these concerns with fixed-effect regression models, limiting the analysis to within-MP and, for individual-level analysis, within-respondent comparisons. This will provide us with a clear identification strategy, with credible claims of causes and effects.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0497	151	Is the Green New Deal a vote-winner? Evidence from the effect of Spain’s transición ecológica policy on national election results	Recent proposals from the US and European left have used the urgent need for climate change action as an opportunity for a “Green New Deal” (GND), involving large-scale public investment into energy, transport and housing systems, with an explicit focus on improving the lives of the working class. Advocates of GND-style policies argue that they are likely to be much more politically popular than conventional climate policies, such as carbon taxes. Yet, little is known about how GND-style policies fare electorally. We hypothesise that they are likely to (re)unite educated, socially and environmentally progressive, urban voters with the traditional working class, increasing the vote share of left-wing parties. We test our hypothesis with the case of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE), which won the general election in April 2019 on a GND-style platform, transición ecológica platform. The incumbent PSOE negotiated deals in 2018 within stakeholders in coalmining municipalities in which the regulated closure of the coalmining industry by 2020 was combined with national government investment in coal regions, worker retraining and social welfare assistance. Combining electoral census data at the municipality level and geo-coded data of coalmines slated for closure, we find that mining municipalities have increased their PSOE support between the 2016 and 2019 general elections. Our paper provides evidence that combining state-driven climate action with a progressive socio-economic agenda can be a winning electoral strategy.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0466	443	How do policy positions of candidates affect vote choice under OLPR? Survey-experimental evidence using real candidates from Switzerland	Recent survey experiments show that information on singular policy positions of (fictional) candidates can affect candidate and party choice under open-list PR systems (Blumenau et al. 2017, Bräuninger et al. 2020). This broadens our view on intra-party competition, which has mostly been studied from the perspective of non-policy representation by individual politicians. We investigate whether these findings travel to a setting with real candidates, where voters may have existing preconceptions of candidates and have to balance information on multiple policies. We draw on the context of the Swiss National Parliament election of 2019. In a 2x2-design, we provide survey respondents with ballots of real candidates that vary by information on candidate’s policy stance in zero, one or two policy dimensions. We focus on the two most salient policy fields in this election, and additionally exploit the fact that a large share of the voting population relied on a comprehensive voting advice application that made candidate positioning transparent to voters. This setting allows us to examine whether candidate information under OLPR can actually allow voters to align their own policy preferences with the preferences of candidates, and which factors may prevent such congruence. The setting also allows us to investigate whether parties with higher intra-party variation on one or several policy dimensions can be more attractive to voters under OLPR on aggregate. Our results inform the debate to which extent preference voting may facilitate policy representation by individual candidates; they also speak to the validity of survey-experiments using hypothetical candidates.

2021	0510	520	Voter Turnout and Party Responsiveness	Numerous studies conclude that declining turnout is harmful for democracy. However, we uncover the arguably positive effect that political parties become more responsive to the median voter in the election after turnout has decreased. We assume that parties are vote-seeking and that moderate voters are responsible for changes in turnout (consistent with Rodon 2017), and we argue that declining turnout in an election sends a clear signal to political parties that there is an opportunity to mobilize voters in the following election by responding to changes in public opinion. We report the results of statistical analyses on data from thirteen democracies from 1977 to 2017 that provide evidence that declining voter turnout in one inter-election period is associated with increasing party responsiveness to public opinion in the following period. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of voter turnout, political representation, and parties’ election strategies.	Comparative Politics
2021	0481	55	Can the Accommodation Strategy be Effective? An Examination of Mainstream Party Shifts in Europe	This paper aims to contribute to recent literature exploring whether the accommodation strategy is beneficial for mainstream political parties. The main theoretical proposition of the paper is that the effectiveness of the accommodation strategy is conditional on where in the policy space a mainstream party shifts to. In addition, I distinguish between two different types of shift. The first is when the mainstream party shifts to a position that is more ideologically extreme than the niche party, or an ‘over shift.’ The second is when the mainstream party shifts to a position that is less ideologically extreme than the niche party, or an ‘under shift.’ To test my argument, I analyze 64 mainstream political parties in 15 European countries from 1981-2018. My results indicate that over shifting increases mainstream party vote share but has no effect on niche party vote share, and under shifting has no effect on either mainstream party vote share nor niche party vote share. My findings have implications for how mainstream parties should compete with their niche party rivals.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour

Does deliberation in random groups affect the composition and ultimate development of a constitution? Here, we test deliberative theories of citizens assemblies in a legislative context. National policy was deliberated in randomly assigned groups of legislators, creating the 1849 June Constitution in Denmark. Using a panel of legislators and roll call votes, we find evidence for substantial and significant deliberative effects, but these go in different directions in different groups. Lottery-based procedures encouraged deliberation during a period of democratization without developed parties, resulting in the constitution that governs Denmark to this day. Our results highlight the need to better understand promising deliberative mechanisms driving behaviour in random assemblies, before transplanting randomisation to national arenas where the stakes are high.

2021	0498	108	The Long-Run Impact of the Viking Settlements in Medieval England	Do inclusive institutions promote long-run development? In this paper, I use the Viking settlements in medieval England to explore the economic consequences of an early transition to inclusive institutions. The Viking settlements in medieval England originated from the Danish conquest of eastern England in 886. With the conquest followed several waves of Viking immigration to the new Danish territory in England. Most Viking settlers were given the right of freemen, a position that ensured political independence from the feudal lords and exclusive property rights over their own farmland. These new institutions laid the foundation for long-run development because they created incentives to work, save and invest. Using a measure of Viking settlements and detailed data on over 16.000 medieval manors, I document an economic legacy of the Viking settlements on various measures of development in 1086 and provide evidence for my proposed mechanism.

2021	0511	536	State-Church Synergies in Colonial Empires: Longitudinal Evidence on Missionary Expansion in Africa	Christian missionaries played an essential role in the colonization of Africa, often entering territories before European powers officially claimed control. While interactions between governmental and religious actors and their long-term consequences have been subject to earlier studies, little is known about the temporal dynamics of colonization. This paper uses new historical data (1800-1925) to explore the timing of mission entries on the African continent as well as their geographic distribution. It is found that formal colonization through a European power increased the number of missions entering a territory. This effect is largely limited to missions from the colonizer's metropole. These aligned missions also become more likely to set up stations in locations close to urban centers and with access to transportation. The findings attest to State-Church synergies in colonies and demonstrate the importance of national networks. These findings improve our understanding of historical processes and have important implications for the study of colonial and missionary legacies of contemporary outcomes. Future research avenues are discussed.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0482	95	Candidate Exit and Voter Loyalty during Early Democratization	Fluctuations of political power might come with widespread consequences for economic development as they may hinder governments from carrying out long-term policies. We ask if such electoral volatility could be a result of voters reacting to changes in the candidate supply in an environment with clientelistic ties between politicians and voters. We use voter-level register data from the 19th-century poll books from nine English parliamentary constituencies. Prior to the Secret Ballot Act of 1872, voting in the United Kingdom was public. These data allow us to track individual voters over time and explore how they react to changes in the candidate supply, conditional on their past voting behavior. We document some persistence in vote choices using such data over the years 1832-1868 despite the weak party system. Yet, almost one third of voters in our data change their vote choice between two consecutive elections. We find that voters who voted for an exiting candidate in the previous election are around 2 percentage points more likely to change their partisan voting behavior in the subsequent election than those voters whose previously chosen candidates reran. While the effect is moderate, our results indicate that candidate turnover explains part of the electoral volatility observed at the aggregate level in the era.	Political Methodology
2021	0517	257	Who gets to play? A typology of the dynamics behind enfranchisement across Europe	What are the historical origins of inter-party competition? Previous work on European political development stresses the importance of a fully enfranchised and mobilized male electorate. Yet, the variable processes by which voters were enfranchised during the pre-democratic era is grossly understudied. Using newly digitized historical data from a cross-section of twenty-four European states, this paper proposes a conceptual typology of the paths to universal male suffrage. The pathway to universal male enfranchisement varies along two dimensions; the timing of inclusion dimension -- or when in the sequence of political development universal male enfranchisement took place, and along the cause dimension -- or what alliance or struggle for power led to enfranchisment. Specifically, universal male suffrage was a result of socialist agitation, a regional compromise, or offensive nationalism. I show that each of the pathways to a fully mobilized male electorate led to a different form of pre-democratic party competition for newly emerging states in the European pre-war period. Pathways to enfranchisement range from states that liberalized access to the vote early on the basis of national identity, to states that were late to liberalize access to the vote and did so as a result of a broad cross-class alliance. I argue and show that who initially played the political game is as important for understanding the development of party competition as understanding how the political game is played.

2021	0468	44	Support for What? Economic Insecurity and Multidimensional Social Policy Preferences	According to decades of political behavior research, economic or labor-market risk should motivate support for social welfare policy, especially social insurance (e.g. Compton & Lipsmeyer 2019; Cusack, Iversen, & Rehm 2006; Rehm 2009). Public policy research, on the other hand, has focused on policy design and the impacts of different policy features on social and economic outcomes (e.g., Jacobs & Mettler 2018; Laenen 2018; Rosenthal 2019). Complex social programs transferring cash benefits to households, such as unemployment insurance, exhibit notable variation in benefit entitlements, duration of eligibility, and stringency of qualification criteria. We ask whether individuals hold distinct preferences over these multiple dimensions of social policy design. Do individuals have multidimensional policy preferences? Further, how does labor-market risk shape these preferences? Drawing from behavioral economics (﻿e.g., Frederick, Loewenstein, and O’Donoghue 2002; Carvalho, Meier & Wang 2016), we argue that economic risk shapes individual time preferences by promoting present-biased decision making. Preferences for temporal policy dimensions, such as duration of eligibility, should therefore be more sensitive to economic insecurity. We test our expectations using a survey experiment in the nationally representative 2020 Cooperative Congressional Election Study in the US, where we manipulate labor market risk to determine multidimensional preferences for unemployment insurance.

2021	0499	194	Office-Holding Premia and Representative Democracy	I show that in a representative democracy, the predominance of high-income citizens in the legislature may imply that no legislator supports the redistribution policy low-income citizens prefer. Provided redistribution is a salient policy issue, the predominance of high-income citizens cannot arise if low-income citizens still support more redistribution once in office—they have to join high-income citizens in opposing it. I formalize the underlying logic using office-holding premia. High-income citizens can only predominate the legislature if high premia induce low-income citizens to oppose more redistribution once in office. The office-holding premium the predominance of high-income citizens requires increases with income inequality.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0483	510	Does Proportional Representation Increase Redistribution? Evidence from Early 20th Century Norwegian Municipalities	Countries that use proportional representation (PR) tend to have higher levels of redistribution. At the same time, countries do not choose their electoral systems at random, which means that PR countries are likely to have different background conditions than non-PR countries. We therefore ask if the strong empirical relationship between the use of PR and higher redistribution is due to these background factors or to PR electoral rules. We take advantage of an electoral reform to early 20th century Norwegian local elections to gain traction on this question. We find that municipalities that were mandated to use PR increased tax rates and resources spent on the poor but also redistributed less in the first place. We further show that the reform did not increase left-wing party seat shares but did increase political mobilization. This evidence is consistent with moderate parties increasing redistribution in order to preempt left-wing party gains.	Comparative Politics
2021	0484	600	When repression signals bad policy	Even in authoritarian states, dissent is not always repressed and repression occasionally seems to backfire and is followed by an increase in dissent. I propose a simple explanation: When a population is uncertain whether it is facing a government whose interest in conducting a certain policy is aligned or misaligned with its own, repression may signal misaligned interest as the government then has more to lose from policy change, thus having more to gain from repression. The population then expects to gain more from dissent. In a game between a government and a population, I show that also a government whose interest is misaligned with the population’s may not always repress, simply because the signalling effect of not repressing decreases the expected gain of dissent for the population. This holds even when repression quells dissent completely. When repression cannot hinder dissent, but instead increases the cost of dissent to the population and reduces its ability to induce policy change, at intermediate levels of costs vs. gains for the government, signalling misalignment means that only NE in which repression is always followed by dissent are PBNE. The game highlights the importance of factors such as institutions that influence the cost of repression. An extension shows that a government who is uncertain about the population’s valuation of policy change is willing to pay for bulk surveillance.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0500	58	The duration of political imprisonment: Evidence from China	The Chinese regime is notorious for the large-scale detention of dissidents and ethnic minorities, however, little is known about the fates of Chinese political prisoners. This study investigates determinants of the duration of political imprisonment and the likelihood of surviving imprisonment in China. Since the length of prison sentences is a function of preceding actions, I categorize Chinese political prisoners according to the crimes they were accused of. Political prisoners are further distinguished on the basis of their religious and ethnic identities, their occupations, and legal processes. I argue that political prisoners that were accused of founding dissident groups and those from ethnic minorities experience the harshest punishment. Drawing on the Chinese Political Prisoners Database, I study the duration of political imprisonment with survival models accounting for cross-national variation between provinces (N=2,128). I investigate the likelihood of dying in prison with logistic regression models controlling for prisoners' ages. Preliminary findings suggest that ethnic Uyghurs are significantly longer imprisoned and more likely to die in prison. The results hold in subgroup analyses of political prisoners that were accused of the same crimes. The findings suggest that ethnic Uyghurs are not only imprisoned in larger numbers but also systematically discriminated within prison walls.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0469	324	Does Banning Extremism Work? Evidence from Employment Bans in Germany	How can states counter growing political extremism? We look at the effect of states persecuting radical individuals by studying the case of the radical decree in Germany. Implemented in 1972, this policy allowed individuals with connections to extremist groups to be banned from working in the public sector. We argue that this policy might have backfired, increasing extremist behavior and reducing voting for the incumbent. Drawing upon a newly collected dataset of individuals targeted by the bans, we run difference-in-differences models to estimate the effect of such bans on the political behavior of German citizens. We also look at the long term effects of the bans by looking at its effects on the subsequent estbalishment of the Green party -- who were the only party campaigning against the ban. In future iterations of the paper, we intend to enrich our findings by contacting and interviewing individuals targeted by the bans. Our findings have implications for the repertoire of policies that states can implement to deter extremist behavior and safeguard democracy.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0512	619	Violations across borders: The impacts of American racial discrimination on support for minority rights around the world	What is the impact of high-profile violations of liberal and democratic norms on support for human rights around the world? The literature on the spread of human rights norms focusses on why some norms are more likely to be accepted than others, but pays little attention to how prominent international violations of those norms might affect their acceptance. This study uses three survey experiments, in China, India, and the United Kingdom, to explore how ethnic and religious discrimination in the United States affects public preferences towards minority rights in other countries. Do American violations encourage people to follow the United States’ example and disavow those norms? This study finds that American human rights violations are widely reported in both open and authoritarian countries' media. However, the impacts of those violations varies widely. For respondents in India, where ethnic tensions are a common feature of the news cycle, exposure to news of American violations did substantially decrease their concern for minority rights at home. However, survey respondents in China and the United Kingdom, with relatively little mainstream day-to-day coverage of ethnic tensions in their country, became, surprisingly, significantly more concerned about minority rights at home when exposed to news of American violations of minority rights. The study demonstrates that when ‘critical states’ like the United States respect or violate well-established human rights norms at home, these actions may have unintended and heterogeneous impacts on human rights across the globe.

2021	0485	52	Praise from Peers Promotes Empathetic Behavior	Empathy can be a powerful and positive tool for shaping and changing policy preferences, encouraging cooperative or inclusionary behavior, and warming attitudes towards others. Yet, recent work has shown that engaging in empathy is costly. We investigate what those costs are --- whether they are emotional or cognitive --- and propose and test an intervention designed to lower the barriers to empathy. In our first study, we verify the cognitive costs of empathy and further harness an incentive-compatible reservation wage design to estimate a monetary price to the cost. We then propose peer praise as an effective and light-touch approach to overcoming such costs and promoting empathetic behavior, developing a second study with an intervention that generates naturalistic peer praise. In a third study, we employ a randomized experiment with natural peer praise (elicited in Study 2) and demonstrate that some of the costs of empathy can be overcome by receiving praise for empathetic behavior from peers. Finally, we propose and test potential emotional mechanisms that might be at play in making peer praise an effective empathy promoter and offer preliminary empirical evidence of such.

2021	0501	423	Which interests? An experimental study of gender differences in political interest	One of the most regular findings drawn from public opinion survey data is that women are less interested in politics than men. Recent studies have started to challenge this common view, by showing that there are significant differences in the political topics women and men are interested in. Allegedly, the classic indicator of political interest (‘In general, how interested are you in politics?’) does not capture equally well women and men’s political interests. As a consequence, part of the gender gap repeatedly identified over time and across countries might be – at least partially – an artifact of the measurement instruments used in surveys. Departing from these late findings, in this article we put the classic indicator of political interest to the test. Using a mixed-methods approach, we unravel latent stimuli implicit in the measurement of political interest. Firstly, we conducted an online cognitive interview to uncover women and men’s potential differences in the understanding and interpretation of the classic survey indicator. Secondly, based on these initial findings, we conducted a series of survey experiments whereby we offered different sets of stimuli to the respondents that connect to different notions of the political. These studies do not only allow for a rigorous test of the gender differences in political interest, but do also open the ground for potential recommendations on the measurement of political interest.

2021	0518	239	The issue basis of citizens’ left-right orientations: Differences across cohorts in Europe	What do citizens make of ‘left’ and ‘right’ when new conflictual issues emerge, rendering the issue space increasingly complex? Previous research shows that the issue basis of citizens’ left-right identification can shift over time in response to the politicization of new issues (de Vries et al. 2013, Knutsen 1995, Rekker 2016). In the Netherlands, the relevance of attitudes towards immigration for left-right self-placement has increased over time (de Vries et al. 2013) and for younger cohorts (Rekker 2016), whereas the relevance of attitudes towards redistribution has weakened over time. I extend this line of research to a comparative setting, studying how associations between citizens’ issue positions and their left-right self-identification vary across generational cohorts in contemporary Europe. I argue that the issue basis of citizens’ left-right positions varies with the salience and politicization of issues during their periods of political socialization. Attitudes on new contested issues, especially immigration but also protection of the environment, should, thus, be more closely associated with left-right positions within younger generations. The empirical analysis draws on cumulative data from the European Social Survey (ESS, round 1-8, 2002-2016) from 30 European countries. I find that, overall, caring for the environment and especially immigration attitudes are stronger predictors of left-right positions among (post-)millennials than among older cohorts. In contrast, attitudes towards redistribution are somewhat less relevant within younger cohorts. Yet, the exact shape of these generational differences varies across countries, apparently in line with the (evolving) structure of domestic party competition.

2021	0470	320	Political Culture(s) Under Threat? How Language Influences Public Attitudes toward Multilevel Governance	Does the way we talk affect what we think about how the state should provide public policies? Language carries with it a history and tradition of a certain territorial scale and communty, not stopping at borders and thought to matter for political culture, too. Yet the notion of political culture is as elusive as it seems important to explain public attitudes. Knowing the extent and import of deep-seated, widely shared attitudes appears all the more urgent for multicultural societies with territorially delimited communities, where cultural differences may fuel inter-governmental conflicts. This paper presents the results of an original survey run in October 2020 in Switzerland, Belgium, Canada and France to better understand inter- and intra-state differences in political attitudes towards multilevel governance. We also included a conjoint experiment to trace cultural preferences for particular forms of multilevel governance, notably with regards to de/centralisation and the involvement of health experts vs. ordinary citizens in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.

2021	0513	276	Voters, elites and punishment of moral transgressions	Are there differences between voters and elected elites in thier view on how severely moral transgressions should be punished? To answer this quesion we admistered four survey experiments to a representative sample of elected elites (n= 1232) and to a representative sample of voters (n=2354). The expeirments vary whether a moral transgression was guided by narrow self-interested or by negligence as well as the gender of moral agent. We hypothesize that personality measured by the big five inventory (60 items battery) is an important moderator of how severly trangressions should be punished. Individuals scoring high on concientiousness are expected to be wiling to punish moral transgressions harder irrespective of the underlying motivation for the transgression. Individuals scoring high on openness are expected to punish transgression motivated by narrow self-intertest harder than transgressions due to negligence. We also expect elected elites to punish moral transgression less hard than the general public. Finally, we expect that women are punished more severely than men by elites as well as by the genreal public. Surprisingly, we do not find support for the hypotheses related to personality. Interestingly, we find that there are not significant differences between how hard elites and the public punish moral transgression. Elites as well as the general public find that moral transgression motivated by self-interest should be punished much harder than transgression due to negligence. Consequently our paper adds to the litterarue on representation by suggesting that difference between elected elites and the general public are mininal.

2021	0026	535	The Territorial Variance of Contamination Effects in Mixed-Member Electoral Systems	The two electoral arenas that co-habit mixed electoral systems interact, producing contamination effects. These raise the number of parties in the nominal arena above what Duverger’s Law suggests. However, the is a surprising assumption that contamination effects are an exclusively national phenomenon. This study highlights the intersection of two important literatures: contamination effects in mixed-member systems and party system nationalization. It assumes that if national parties compete symmetrically in one district, but districts are heterogenous, then it is likely that they compete asymmetrically in other districts. In this sense, it assumes that the strength of contamination effects may vary in countries with heterogenous districts. Specifically, in countries with ethnicically dissimilar districts. It relies on a large-N (cross-country) analysis that shows how contamination effects are higher in countries with low levels of party system nationalization, and that contamination effects are lower in countries with higher levels of party system nationalization.

2021	0047	461	Who gets to speak for the party? How parliamentary party groups assign spokespersonships	Parliamentary debate is key to both representation and policymaking in democracies. However, in many parliamentary systems, access to the floor is controlled and restricted and MPs become spokesperson of a specific policy portfolio. They speak only on that issue and are primarily responsible for formulating and articulating their party’s position on that issue in parliament. This study examines what criteria political party groups use to decide which MPs serve as designated spokesperson on an issue. The key concept in our paper is specialization: the assignment of spokespersonships is the outcome of a process of careful consideration for the party because they distribute and delegate decision-making and policymaking power on day-to-day business in parliament. We build on the literature on committee assignments, which points to informational, distributional and partisan rationales behind legislator’s specialization. The informational rationale suggests that MPs become spokesperson on the issues that they have specialist knowledge of. The distributional rationale predicts MPs to be spokesperson on those issues for which they have ties to relevant groups outside parliament, such as voters and interest groups. Finally, according to the partisan rationale, parties will assign issue portfolios that the party leadership prioritizes to the more prominent MPs in the parliamentary party group. We analyse a database of the parliamentary and pre-parliamentary careers of all Danish MPs (2011 – 2020), while observing who holds each spokespersonship in each party. Our analysis sheds important light on how parliamentary party groups function, in particular how they divide labour within their ranks.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0013	111	Ideological Positions and Committee Chair Appointments	Committee chairs hold crucial positions in the legislative process. With their prerogatives ex officio they can push or quell legislative initiatives and are pivotal in the government's agenda. While previous studies have examined which party receive which committee chair, less is known about committee chair appointment within parties. We examine who ruling parties (principal) appoint to committee chairs (agent) in order to minimize the risk of policy moving away from government positions. Using data on Japanese Members of Parliament from 2003 to 2017 we test theoretical expectations derived from the principal-agent framework. Japan makes an ideal case to study intra-party chair appointment due to its coalitions' office allocation patterns. We find that parties appoint MPs who are ideologically closer to the cabinet's position to chair positions on committees with jurisdiction on high and foreign policy. However, we find no effect of ideological distance on chair appointments on particularistic committees. Our findings are robust across cabinets, parties and variation in committee classifications. These findings contribute to our understanding of political appointments and legislative processes.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0039	459	Electoral system and party moderation in Northern Ireland	This study seeks to empirically measure the moderating impact of PR-STV in ethnically divided societies by comparing levels of moderation in the manifestoes of Northern Irish parties at Northern Ireland Assembly elections, which take place under PR-STV, and U.K. House of Commons elections, which operate using First Past the Post. Northern Ireland presents a unique electoral situation, where ethnic parties regularly contest elections under two different systems: one which is designed to foster moderation, and one which is not. Whereas most studies on the impact of electoral engineering in divided societies compare elections before and after significant constitutional changes, the present study mitigates the confounding impact of social and attitudinal changes that occur over time on party moderation levels by limiting the time-lag between PR-STV and FPTP elections. Because these two electoral systems continue to operate alongside one another in an ethnically divided society, the study compares elections under different electoral systems but in largely similar political contexts, thereby isolating as much as possible the electoral system as the independent variable. In doing so, this study will contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of electoral engineering in divided societies, and specifically the use of PR-STV to foster moderation.

2021	0005	552	Facilitating negotiations on complex, controversial and salient topics: How mediators shape the content of peace agreements	Recent quantitative research has begun to model peace agreement content. However, very few studies examine how mediators shape individual agreement content and peace accord comprehensiveness. The most recent contributions use latent variable models to scale agreements statistically according to their comprehensiveness. Although this research considers mediation as a predictor of comprehensiveness, it comes to the surprising conclusions that mediators seem to reduce the comprehensiveness of agreements. However, it offers no substantive theoretical explanation for this result. We address this gap and develop a theoretical argument, which argues that mediators do far more than “ripen” the conflict and shape agreement comprehensiveness. Additionally, mediators structure negotiations, set the agenda, and prioritize some topics while strategically postponing others. Whether and when an issue is part of the negotiation depends on the ripeness of the negotiation situation and the characteristics of the specific issue. We hypothesize that mediators facilitate compromise on the most difficult and controversial topics and increase the likelihood that these topics are included in the agreement. Hence, mediators shape individual content and not just conflict parties’ ripeness for a comprehensive agreement. We draw on data of the UCDP Peace Agreement Dataset and the PA-X Database to model and test our theory.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0018	119	Manpower Acquisition Institutions and the Battlefield	After decades of being on the decline, conscription is making something of a comeback. Since 2012 more than 20 countries have introduced conscription policies. While debates surrounding the implementation of similar policies have taken place in many more. Although considerable scholarly attention has been paid to the causes and consequences of conscription, important questions remain unanswered. We disaggregate military manpower aqusition systems into three types--selective, unversal, and all volunterer. We contend that the type of manpower system will determine how the costs of war are distributed throughout society. Further, the way the costs are distributed will have an effect the way the war is fought and whether or not a state is victorious. To test our theory, we employ a mixed methods approach. We use orginal data to find the effect of different manpower aquisition schemes on battlefield deaths, intensity, war duration, and war outcomes. On average, states employing selective conscription fight shorter and more intense wars and are more likely to be victorious relative to states using other systems. We gain additional insight into this phenomenon through an in-depth case study of the United State's expericence during the Vietnam War using both secondary and archival sources and synthetic control for counter factual analysis.

2021	0043	100	From subsidizers to co-belligerents: Why foreign sponsors intervene militarily in civil war	In many civil wars, from Vietnam and Afghanistan during the Cold War to Ukraine and Libya today, foreign state sponsors sometimes provide more intrusive and invasive support over the course of the conflict. Surprisingly, this increased level of assistance often happens when the supported side is in disagreement with or under heavy criticism from the sponsor. What explains more invasive foreign intervention in civil conflict? This paper proposes a theory that ascribes foreign support to a strategy of control by the sponsor over the recipient of support and the conflict itself. When foreign sponsors are dissatisfied about the recipient’s performance or are concerned about the latter's preferences, they can address the issue by increasing their level of commitment rather than withdrawing. High costs of withdrawal, high levels of threat, and the absence of alternative recipients increase the likelihood of this outcome. This paper also studies the recipient's preferences for more or less intrusive assistance, and explores how local actors can influence their stronger patrons. I plan to use quantitative analysis of the UCDP External Support Dataset as well as a case study of the Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) to probe the theory.

2021	0031	468	Distance and Military Power: When and How it Matters	The relation between space and conflict is a long-established research agenda. The specific question of the effect of geographic distance on military power recently received much less attention. The relationship was studied but remains undertheorized, with much effort aimed at the question of whether its significance is decreasing with technological advancements. With the return of great power competition and renewed risk of major interstate armed conflicts, it is important to reexamine the degree to which distance presents a barrier to military power and under what condition distance matters. The paper examines the different causal mechanism linking geographic distance with a decrease in military power and conditions under which they gain or lose significance. This is done through a comprehensive review of existing research, incorporating findings of military logistics scholarship and detailed exploration of an extreme case of Falklands war. The paper argues, that while distance is always affecting military operations, it significantly constrains the military power of a state only in specific conditions. Prime of those is time pressure, the scale of the war testing limits of nations material capabilities and ability of the defending state to contest far away areas. These findings help to reconcile diverging findings of the previous research on importance of distance, as it demonstrates why distance was not a major obstacle for many recent wars but also cautions about the importance of distance in a potential major power war.

2021	0027	501	Why are immigrants less likely to engage in politics? -The impact of genes, shared environment and individual experience	Immigrants often report lower rates of political participation compared to native majority members (Bird et al. 2011). In this paper, we synthesize arguments from the literatures on the intergenerational transmission of political participation and behavioral genetics to develop a more encompassing and thorough model explaining this gap in participation. Research using candidate gene studies (5HTT and MAOA) identified a plausible biological pathway by which genetic endowment increases the likelihood of individuals being more or less likely to engage in prosocial behavior such as political participation (Fowler and Dawes 2008; Edlin et al. 2007). At the same time, genetic studies demonstrate that environmental stress moderates gene expression leading to a higher prevalence of antisocial behavior. Immigrants tend to have more frequently stressful experience (Hovey 2000; e.g., due to experience of discrimination, language inadequacy, lack of social and financial resources), which may activate genes linked to antisocial behavior (including lower political participation rates). Hence, we expect that part of the political participation gap will be explained by systematic differences in the stressfulness of environment. Additionally, we argue that biological similarity within families contaminates prior research on intergenerational transmission patterns resulting in an overestimation of the extent to which transmission actually occurs (Jankowski 2007). We use multilevel models for extended family data to account for biological similarity to investigate patterns of intergenerational transmission. Our modeling strategy will focus on the question testing whether the extent to which the family environment is strained or stressful moderates direct transmission effects of parental political participation.

2021	0014	342	Political Context and the Formation of Party Identification in the United States	Party identification (PID) is a central concept for the explanation and prediction not only of electoral choices but also of issue attitudes and political perception. The traditional conception of PID attributes its formation mostly to citizens' primary socialisation by family and primary social groups. While it has often been debated in the literature whether PID really is an 'unmoved mover' or subject to feedback effects from the political performance of party candidates or their issue positions, this discussion has usually focussed on the national level. We complement this perspective in two ways: first, by looking at feedback effects that originate at the level of individual US states, second, by looking at the socialisation effects of the partisanship of presidents and state governments. Using multilevel ordinal logit modelling applied to cumulated American Election Study data from 1958 to 1992, we show that even after controlling for parental PID and other predictors, the party not only of the US president but also of the governor of the state experienced during adolescence and early adulthood affects the formation of PID. Our results confirm the importance of social identity theory for a complete understanding of citizens' partisanship.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0040	618	The psychological roots of negative partisanship. Evidence from Germany.	Analysing the impact of personality traits on voting behaviour, especially for right-wing parties, has a long tradition. Most studies found indirect effects of Big-Five personality traits on vote choice mediated for example by political attitudes, such as partisanship, affective attitudes towards the parties or ideological preferences (e.g. Aidt & Rauh, 2018; Schoen & Schumann, 2007). These studies focussed only on the positive side of the explanation of vote choice such as positive partisanship and leader evaluations. However, more and more studies (e.g. Medeiros and Noel, 2015; Mayer, 2017; Abramowitz & Webster, 2018; Ridge, 2020) showed the importance of negative reasons for voting, namely negative party identification or negative affect towards another party or its leader, for voting behavior - often people are not voting for a party because they prefer it, but because they don't like the other(s) or like the other(s) even less. So far, no one has analysed the psychological bases of such 'negative voting' or individual affective polarization in a multiparty system. Based on the German GESIS Panel I explore the relationship between the Big-Five personality traits as well as the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Concept with different aspects of negative voting.

2021	0439	628	The effects of pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood on the gender gap in political knowledge. A large scale longitudinal survey	There is ample evidence that women know less about politics than men. Recent work has shown that parenthood affects political knowledge so that the gender gap is greater between parents than non-parents. However, little is known about when and how parenthood affects the way individuals acquire political information. We use an original five-wave longitudinal data collection of Swedish parents (N = 6,940) following expecting parents from early pregnancy until the child is two months (the Swedish Pregnancy Panel). Pregnant woman and their partners were recruited in a waiting area of a hospital that receives 96 percent of all pregnant women in the second largest city of Sweden, providing unique coverage of parents from different backgrounds. Participants were asked about political events, and we changed our measures every third week during 18 months and covered events relevant to the population. We provide a unique insight into how parental identity, time constraints, and pregnancy and childbirth-related complications affect women’s and men’s political knowledge. Preliminary results show that knowledge about political events decreases during this time of life, and we see a greater drop for fathers, closing the gender gap somewhat temporarily. For certain topics, most significantly for welfare topics, both mothers and fathers learn more. Furthermore, the hypothesized mechanisms are confirmed where a higher level of parental identity results in a larger gap. Time constraints is also partially confirmed, but mostly for women. We engage in a discussion about a lifelong process of socialization with adult experiences.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0407	184	Political gender gaps across countries and generations: the impact of socioeconomic position over the life course	Modernization theory states that changes to women’s socioeconomic position explains why women in younger cohorts are generally more supportive of the left – the political gender gap. Cross-national differences in the gender gap have been ascribed to differences in labour-force participation, marriage, and divorce rates; but individual-level studies struggle to explain political gender gaps using factors such as labour-force participation, education level, and marital status, especially for younger cohorts. This study attempts to explain this contradiction in the literature on political gender gaps by using longitudinal panel data from different European countries to directly measure the gendered relationship between certain life-course events and political attitudes/behaviours. First, we expect that individual changes in respondents’ socioeconomic position (including work and education) and civil status over the life course impact respondents’ economic attitudes and political preferences more strongly for women than for men. Second, we expect that these effects differ between countries and across generations, depending on the country’s and generations’ female labour-force participation, marriage and divorce rates, and gendered division of care work. These hypotheses are tested using household panel data from Germany (G-SOEP, 1984-2019), Switzerland (SHP, 1999-2019) and the UK (BHPS/UKHLS, 1991-2019), for different generations. The insights of the study contribute to the understanding of the formation of contemporary gender gaps across European countries, the relevance of modernization theory to explain this phenomenon, and how changes in socioeconomic and civil status over the life course impact individuals’ political preferences differently for men and women across different generations.

2021	0390	425	Age Isn't Just a Number: A Comparative Age-Period-Cohort Analysis of Political Beliefs	Age as a determinant of political beliefs can be conceived as capturing one of two broad processes: ageing effects, wherein ageing or changes over the life-cycle produce differences between age groups and cohort effects, wherein generations are ‘socialised’ and retain distinctive features over time. Thus far, comparative analysis of the effects of age and cohort have only been performed for beliefs on European integration. Analysis of left-right and libertarian-authoritarian beliefs have been restricted to national analyses primarily in the UK. This paper therefore fills the gap created by this apparent lack by performing an exploratory comparative age-period-cohort analysis for left-right and libertarian-authoritarian beliefs in Western Europe. It finds that age-related processes matter considerably more for authoritarian-libertarian beliefs. These results imply that as these beliefs become more salient, so too will age differences in political preferences – and therefore perhaps political behaviour.

2021	0423	381	Does University Make you Less Prejudiced? Evidence from a Longitudinal Cohort Study	An individual’s level of education is increasingly significant in explaining their political attitudes and behaviour, but why education should have this effect is not well understood. Competing explanations include selection effects (confounding by pre-adult characteristics such as family background) and allocation effects (confounding by post-treatment covariates such as socio-economic position). This new analysis of 1970 British Cohort Study data uses genetic matching and sequential g-estimation to estimate the absolute controlled direct effect (ACDE) of higher education on racial prejudice, social authoritarianism and economic Left-Right values, adjusting for these selection and allocation effects. It finds that attending university leads to significant reductions in racial prejudice and social authoritarianism, while the effects on economic values are attributed to economic allocation. It further extends knowledge by examining the mechanism through which the change happens: whether this is attributable to cognitive change or educational socialisation, by modelling variation in educational experience through inverse probability weighting techniques. Given the impossibility of operating a randomised field experiment to assign individuals to different educational pathways, the methods employed in this study likely produce the best, most unbiased, estimate of the effect of university on racial prejudice and political values.

2021	0503	547	A Path to Moderate the Extremes? The Impact of Moderate Voters on Euroskeptic Party Policy Positions	As euroskeptic parties have expanded their vote share in national elections, how do they react to a new set of voters representing more varied policy preferences? Do they attempt to moderate on certain policies to keep these voters, or simply continue to play to their traditional base and maintain a more extreme position that may ultimately lead these newly won voters towards a different party in the next election? In this paper, I argue that these new voters represent new groups that could demand moderation by the parties on policies in subsequent electoral cycles. I posit that the parties will engage in a balancing act where they assess on which policies they can moderate towards the average party system position to maintain the support of these new voters without driving away voters from their traditional base as they may view such moderation as a betrayal of the party's identity. This study examines positions on a variety of policies provided by party manifestos in both Western and Eastern European countries from the early 2000s to the present against the voters expressed party preferences and vote in the previous national election using the European Social Survey in addition to national elections surveys such as the German Longitudinal Election Study. The study intends to demonstrate how new voters outside the euroskeptic party's traditional base can function as an unintended moderating component and lead the party to moderate on policies if it hopes to continually attract these voters in subsequent national elections.

2021	0472	363	A blessing and a curse? Examining public preferences for differentiated integration	The EU is a system of differentiated integration (DI). Policy areas have reached different levels of integration (vertical DI), and integrated policies have not been uniformly applied across the EU’s member states (horizontal DI). While we have witnessed an increase in DI as well as scholarly work describing and explaining it, we currently know very little about what the public thinks. In this paper, we aim to map public preferences for DI, and to examine differences between Euroskeptic and pro-EU citizens. To do this, we rely on public opinion data from the Eurobarometer from 2004 to 2018, novel survey data from 2020 and a conjoint experiment from January 2021. Our key finding is that support for DI has increased in recent years, and public preferences on the issue have become more crystallized (less don't know answers). That said, important individual-level differences exist. While Euroskeptic segments of the population support DI, more pro-EU segments prefer deeper and more uniform integration. This suggests that while DI may be a blessing to signal more responsiveness to Euroskeptics, it may simultaneously prove a curse and alienate more pro-EU parts of the population.	EU Politics
2021	0487	576	Normalization of Euroscepticism or normal politicization of European integration: French elites' ambivalence towards the EU in the media	Since the difficult ratification of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 and, even more so, the failure of the Constitutional treaty in 2005, European issues have become more salient in national politics. Simultaneously, popular support for European integration has decreased, while Eurosceptic parties have gained votes. Criticism of the EU has become legitimate and commonplace over the last two decades, spreading even among leaders and parties who declare themselves Europhile. Alongside discourses from anti-EU parties that reject explicitly the European project, pro-EU actors criticize the path the EU is taking more openly. We argue that this 'Euro-alternativism' (FitzGibbon 2013) creates an “ambivalent discursive environment”, that sends mixed signals in the public space. This paper studies the evolution of criticism towards the EU among the elites as reported in the media. Using France as a case study, its aim is to present a proof of concept for an index of 'Euro-Ambivalence', defined as a ratio between different discourse regarding the EU, from strict opposition to full promotion through criticism and alternativism. I use media reports as the main source because we know that most political issues are beyond the range of personal experience. People know mostly about politics indirectly through the media, rather than direct communication from the parties. Therefore, what the media filter matters. This study follows a constructionist approach that focuses on “critical discourse moments” (Gamson 1992) since the last European elections before Maastricht (1989) until December 2020 when the Brexit is acted.

2021	0456	289	When opposites attract: Causes and consequences of different types of Euroscepticism among voters.	The paper analyses the nature, causes and consequences of different types of Euroscepticism among voters. Literature on party positions on European issues has shown that the relationship between left-right ideology and support for the EU has an inverse U-shape, with parties on both extremes of the ideological axis expressing a lower level of support than parties closer to the center. Radical left parties have always been critical about the free-market slant of EU policies, while radical right parties have underscored the threats posed by the integration process to national cultures and sovereignty. However, the Euroscepticism of these two groups of parties is different in nature. Leftist parties are not in principle against the idea of supranational integration and institutions, since they fit with leftist preferences for international cooperation and regulation. Conversely, the nationalistic and traditionalist worldview of right-wing parties is incompatible with the transfer of powers to supranational institutions and its corresponding loss of national sovereignty. The paper uses panel survey data collected in Spain during 2019 to investigate whether, when, and with which consequences these differences exist among voters with different ideologies. The paper aims to assess: (i) whether different types of Euroscepticism exist among voters; (ii) whether and when voters’ Euroscepticism is aligned with the Euroscepticism of their parties; (iii) how (different types of) Euroscepticism affect(s) the likelihood of voting for different radical parties. The results will provide a finer-grained picture of citizens’ preferences and will shed light on the dynamics of the party-voter linkage on EU issues.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0019	31	Between Parochialism and Expertise: Consultative Institutions in Authoritarian Regimes	With the rise of authoritarian regimes globally scholars have increasingly paid attention to how formal institutions such as elections, parties, and legislatures contribute to authoritarian rule. However, what has received less attention so far are consultative institutions that exist in different shapes and their function for authoritarian regimes. Drawing on data from two People’s Provincial Consultative Conferences (PPCC) in China this paper develops a theory of delegates’ participation inside these assemblies. The results show that consultative institutions can serve as an effective channel for local and professional knowledge transmission that are useful for rational policy-making. Specifically, local government officials are particularly active to transmit local knowledge and appeal to the provincial government. Academics as well as professionals are also significantly more active than other delegates. With these alternative knowledge resources, consultative institutions can potentially contribute to a rationalization of policy-making.	Comparative Politics

Television and online aggregators, both controlled by the regime, have been most trusted sources of media consumption in Russia in 2018 – 2020. Drawing on the dataset collected over the period and applying topic modelling text analysis technique, I demonstrate that state-controlled online news are less biased than national television shows. Additionally, drawing on linguistic complexity of the texts, I show that online news are designed for a better educated audience capable of understanding more complex information. I conclude that in the environment where news outlets are state-controlled and trusted by the population, autocratic regime tailors its media manipulation strategies in order to set the agenda most favourable for the regime survival while adjusting the news bias depending on the audience’s education, and hence, tendency to be critical about the information consumed. The article contributes to the literature on contemporary autocratic resilience and media agenda-setting.	Political Communications

The theoretical arguments are tested here in contemporary China. We provide the first systematic evidence of prevalent dynastic succession in China. At the individual level, the princelings enjoyed political favors from national leaders, but they were resisted at more inclusive institutions such as provincial government and the national communist party congress, in particular during dynastic transition. Our findings are robust as we utilize two separate measures of clandestine princeling status: one comes from comprehensive qualitative research, the other comes from a huge database of Chinese given names and our new text-analysis model that exploits the unique style with which the communist revolutionary leaders named their babies. Our research suggests that dictators face a fundamental tradeoff between dynastic succession and institutionalization.	Comparative Politics
2021	0132	663	Political Entrepreneurs and the New Party Challenge in Europe	Party politics is changing. In recent times the once stable party systems of Western Europe have witnessed the emergence of parties challenging the position of previously dominant parties and winning sizeable slices of support at the ballot box. In Central and Eastern Europe fluid party systems have been the norm for longer where the combination of novelty, anti-corruption and celebrity has become a commonly-used recipe for new party success. And yet in both parts of the continent some parties have managed to endure. Drawing on the findings from two books, Political Entrepreneurs: the Rise of Challenger Parties in Europe (De Vries & Hobolt) and The New Party Challenge: Changing Cycles of Party Birth and Death in Central Europe and Beyond (Haughton & Deegan-Krause) this panel examines the causes behind the rise, fall and endurance of parties, and explores whether there are common explanations for the dynamics of party politics across the European continent.

2021	0471	313	Values, Theories and Pragmatism: the Economic Ideas of British and German Politicians	An influential literature in comparative political economy focuses on the role of (changing) ideas in (changing) policy and institutions. In this paper we explore how politicians in Germany and the UK talk reflectively and in private about their economic ideas. From over 40 semi-structured interviews, three distinct dimensions of variation emerge. First, politicians talk readily about their placement on the economic “left” or “right”, but this signals their normative commitments to equality or (market) freedom rather than a coherent economic ideology. Second, politicians vary in the degree to which they are ideological (by Sartori’s definition) as opposed to pragmatic. Finally, they differ in the positive theories they believe about cause-and-effect relationships. Though not independent of their normative views, these are conceptually distinct, especially among the more pragmatic. There are interesting patterns in the joint distributions of these characteristics: those on the left tend to be more ideological, and the ordoliberal theoretical paradigm is rarely combined with high levels of pragmatism. Differentiating the “moving parts” of economic ideas provides important insights into the scope for new re-combinations, and their empirical probability, at a time when the dominant economic paradigm of the past thirty years is under increasing strain.

2021	0502	386	The role of perceived fairness in shaping attitudes toward redistributive policies	This project proposes a theoretical model of support for redistribution in which the perceived fairness of redistributive policy plays a central role. The model builds on the recent body of research in both social psychology and political science, in which an emerging consensus points to the importance of perceived fairness in determining attitudes toward income inequality and redistribution. A key insight in this literature is that people accept inequalities that are seen as fair, and they evaluate fairness by referring to predictable and widely shared normative rules that govern resource allocation. This means that people can and do support substantial inequalities of outcome as fair, even when such inequalities do not serve their personal economic self-interest. I will propose that a theoretical model of inequality-oriented attitudes that centers perceptions of fairness can be both useful and rigorous. To demonstrate the centrality of fairness perceptions in support for redistribution, a survey experiment shows that asking respondents about the fairness of various policies yields the same patterns of response as asking them which policies they support. This constitutes partial evidence that fairness is a key psychological construct through which such policies are evaluated. I then draw on the literature on group-centered democratic politics to explore how group-based stereotypes can systematically influence judgments of fairness, and how we can use insights from this literature to understand well-known patterns in support for redistribution and to create falsifiable predictions regarding such support.

2021	0486	217	Why is it so difficult to tax the rich? Evidence from German policy-makers	Why are rich citizens not taxed more heavily – despite growing inequality (aversion)? Several explanations for this puzzle exist at different analytical levels: voters’ decision-making, party-interest-group linkages or international competition. Crucially, all of them ultimately work through the minds and actions of politicians and, hence, through economic ideas. Taking Germany as a case, we therefore ask which obstacles left-wing politicians perceive in taxing the rich. In 25 semi-structured interviews with actors from parties and interest groups, we tease out subjective accounts for the failure to tax the rich. Overall, tax increases are perceived as unpromising political projects. Organized business interests are described as a major barrier, but in a way that goes beyond most existing accounts: besides classical lobbying, business interests are seen to influence electoral politics through long-term communication strategies that shape public opinion on tax issues. Moreover, the interviews point to a previously unrecognized barrier: organizational dynamics within left-wing parties around the production of tax competence. Left-wing politicians are often overwhelmed by tax issues which results in consequential disadvantages when confronted with resourceful anti-tax actors. They describe how party-internal discourses shape these competence patterns by influencing motivations, feasibility perceptions, and electoral strategies.

2021	0020	171	What factors influence perceptions of a fair election and with what consequences?	It is key for representative democracy not only that elections are objectively free, fair and non-fraudulent but also that they are perceived by the public as such. While the perceived fairness of an election may depend on various factors, today elections are particularly in danger of foreign actors’ efforts to interfere in the election campaign. In several countries, election officials are increasingly taking action to prevent foreign interference with the overarching goal of increasing public confidence in the electoral process. Yet, very little is known about the factors shaping voters’ perceptions of a fair election and the perceived interference by foreign actors. In this paper, we study what factors influence perceptions of a fair election and with what consequences on democratic system support, measured as satisfaction with democracy. We focus on the 2019 elections for the European Parliament (EP), for which European authorities had instituted an electoral package to monitor and enforce rules against election interference by foreign actors. To examine citizens’ perception of a fair election and of external actors’ interference in the election process, we rely on original panel data across ten EU member states. The repeated measurement – at the start of the campaign and after the elections – further allows us to study how and why citizens’ perceptions changed and with what consequences for satisfaction with EU democracy. The comparative data further allows to examine whether the perceptions, changes and consequences are generalizable or whether they depend on specific country contexts.

2021	0033	376	The political geography of satisfaction with democracy	While a substantial literature explores the drivers of satisfaction with democracy, the potential effects of geography on satisfaction with democracy have so far been ignored. Both centre-periphery and urban-rural dynamics have substantial potential for influencing the extent to which voters are satisfied with democratic rule, yet we know little about the functioning and effects of such dynamics. Seeking to overcome this lacuna, in this paper, we combine CSES survey data with measures of geographical centrality in a country to explore how the geography of a respondent’s electoral constituency relative to the national capital influences levels of satisfaction with democracy. Our primary explanatory variable is the distance between the electoral district and the national capital. We expect an interactive relationship between geographical distance and the federal or unitary structure of the state, with distance to the capital having a less negative effect in federal countries. We further explore the effect of political (de-) centralisation on satisfaction with democracy using the Regional Authority Index. Using data covering over twenty countries over a period of 25 years, we find that both federalism and decentralisation lowers the negative effects of distance to the capital on satisfaction with democracy.

2021	0044	288	Complete Conquerors. Government Alternation and Satisfaction with Democracy	The literature on satisfaction with democracy has emphasised the importance of the electoral systems. Recent research on the subject however indicates that electoral systems no longer play the prominent role they once did. This study proposes to reinvigorate the study of political institutions for the importance of satisfaction with democracy. This study adds the difference between wholesale and partial alternation: that is the difference between countries where if the parties supporting the government lose their majority in elections, the opposition comes into power (wholesale alternation where) and countries where if the parties supporting the government lose their majority in elections, some parties leave government, some parties enter government but at least one party stays in government (partial alternation). This variable may form an important missing variable for the study of satisfaction with democracy. The strength of PR systems is that they allow for the representation of the full breadth of citizens’ opinions in parliament. The strength of majoritarian systems is supposed to be that their elections offer citizens a meaningful choice for who will govern them. The literature on the effect of electoral systems on satisfaction with democracy has seen this as a trade-off between two options. Yet, in countries with wholesale alternation the elections effectively decide who gets into power, independent of whether they use proportional and majoritarian electoral systems. The central question of this study is whether wholesale alternation boosts satisfaction with democracy. This question is examined by combining the CSES election surveys with data on government formation.	Comparative Politics
2021	0007	20	Disconfirmed Winning Expectations Decrease Voter Satisfaction with Democracy	Every vote creates winners and losers, opening a satisfaction gap between the two. At a time when concerns are high for democracy, we do not know what exactly leaves substantial proportions of voters—losers—dissatisfied with the system. This paper will provide causal evidence for the cognitive dissonance theory, which points at disconfirmed winning expectations. With a difference-in-differences design around the Brexit referendum, it finds that the result caused an additional 3% decrease in the losers’ satisfaction if they were expecting to win the vote. The gap grows with the strength of expectations, and the losers to whom the result came as a complete surprise experienced almost a three times larger decrease in satisfaction, compared to the losers who were sure they would lose. If winning expectations affect how dissatisfied losers become after votes, then those who set expectations about voting outcomes have responsibilities for the stability of democracy.

2021	0008	435	Discounting Government Debt: Individual attitudes towards debt reduction in Brazil	Government support for debt reduction requires popular support. Yet, there is considerable disagreement about what drives citizens’ support for debt consolidation and how they approach intertemporal dynamics requiring a contemporary investment to avoid future calamity. Do individuals delay consolidation because they discount the future for irrational reason? Or is discouting behavior driven by rational distrust in government? Or are individuals primarily motivated by distributive conflict over who bares the burden of fiscal adjustment? This paper presents the results of a innovative conjoint choice survey that tests how temporal discounting and distributive conflict interact to influence support for debt consolidation. We find that, among our 2,000 Brazilian respondents, distributive pressures are a central reason for the delay in fiscal adjustment. However, this distributive pressure is weakened as the potential for a crisis is more proximate. Importantly, our design also allows us to explore individual variation in response to our treatments. We find that respondents that are more likely to discount future individual welfare payments are also more likely to exhibit discounting behavior towards policy. The findings provide insight into the microfoundations of debt crises in emerging markets but hold relevance for other policy issues, like climate change, that have similar temporal dynamics.

2021	0045	391	Migration, Remittances and the Fiscal Contract	How does the receipt of remittances shape attitudes towards taxation? We argue that receiving remittances weakens the fiscal contract of taxation in return for public services. Those who receive remittances can use the money sent by friends or family overseas to obtain public services like health and education on the private market instead of through tax-funded government schemes. Previous studies of the relationship between remittances and taxation have taken a macro-level view, focusing on how remittance flows affect how much money governments receive from various types of taxation. Our paper is the first to examine this relationship at the individual level, building on recent work examining the micro-foundations of the fiscal contract in developing countries and analysing the connections between family migration and attitudes towards redistribution and public spending. Using survey data from Africa and Latin America, we find that those who receive money from abroad are less supportive of taxation and more likely to approve of tax evasion and avoidance. The evidence suggests that migrant remittances can undermine the development of a robust fiscal contract.	Comparative Politics
2021	0034	498	Selling Sovereignty: International Coercion, Debt Diplomacy, and Land Transactions	What if countries cannot repay their loans to other countries? Existing research concentrates on the decision to default or not. In addition, much work has examined how states restructure debt or seek debt relief. We consider an additional debt management strategy: repaying loans with land. When Sri Lanka found itself unable to repay a loan in 2015, it granted China a 99-year lease for a deep-sea port in return for a significant debt reduction. We examine the political dynamics that lead to such debt-for-land deals. We focus on the trade-offs implicit in the various policy options available. Our theory concerning debtor countries predicts that the political strength of interest groups shape the likelihood that governments consider selling land. Our statistical analysis suggests that an increase in political influence by Finance is associated with an increase likelihood of austerity measures and land deals but reduces the likelihood of default. In contrast, an increase in political influence by Labor lowers the likelihood of austerity measures and land deals, while default becomes more likely. We make three contributions. First, we develop a novel theoretical framework to simultaneously analyze governments' choice among four interdependent debt management strategies (repayment, default, debt relief, and land deals). Second, we assembled a new dataset capturing instances in which governments voluntarily ceded control over land to other countries, totaling over 1,500 of transactions. Third, our study sheds light on how debtor governments attempt to protect political sovereignty in a context of economic pressures.	International Relations and Conflict

China has emerged as the world’s largest official creditor and there is ongoing debate around the nature and impact of its growing financial influence. Chinese lending is unique in that half of its overseas loans are unreported to credit markets, potentially concealing the true financial health of borrowers and China’s role in sovereign debt markets. This paper argues that China’s decision to extend hidden loans is driven by both the interests of the Chinese state and debtor governments. First, China has a geopolitical interest in avoiding international opposition to its lending, particularly to rogue states. Second, borrowing countries stand to benefit from hidden loans when they face domestic opposition to Chinese intervention or fear credit market punishment if they take on excessive debt. I test the determinants of hidden lending using recently released data on China’s reported and unreported overseas lending. I use a seemingly unrelated regression to demonstrate that a country is more likely to receive a hidden loan when it has an existing conflict with a Western power or is at risk of losing access to traditional credit markets. This is the first study of hidden lending on the sovereign debt market and the results have implications for international relations and political economy research into China’s global influence.

2021	0035	181	Who benefits from new issues? The Covid-19 pandemic and the continuity of Green party success in Switzerland	The spectacular electoral gains of the Greens and the Green Liberals at the 2019 Swiss elections have often been explained by the high salience of the climate issue (e.g., Tresch et al., 2020). Such an explanation is in line with issue ownership theory (Budge & Farlie 1983 ; Petrocik 1996), which expects voters to cast their ballot for the party with the best reputation on the most salient issue at the time of the election. Since the elections, however, voters’ problem concerns have changed: the climate issue has lost some of its importance, whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a top priority for many voters. In this paper, we analyze which parties stand to win or to lose from voters’ changing issue priorities. On the one hand, the declining salience of the climate issue should lead to a loss of popularity for the green parties. On the other, as a new, and not previously owned issue, the COVID-19 pandemic might not produce clear winners. If anything, governing parties might benefit, given that the pandemic has generally strengthened the executive. To address these questions, we draw on the 2019 and 2020 panel waves conducted in the framework of the Swiss Election Study (Selects) among a representative sample of Swiss voters.

2021	0009	190	Coalition Policymaking and Opposition Legislative Review: Collaboration, Bill Obstruction, and Issue-Ownership	Conventional perspectives on multiparty policymaking almost exclusively focus on intra-coalition dynamics within legislative institutions and outline how legislative amendments serve as a tool for policing the coalition compromise and for substantive issue differentiation from governing partners. Only recently, research has begun to examine the role of opposition parties in legislative review. Scholars have demonstrated that while coalition partners are bound by informal rules which limit them to adding to or redrafting government policy (constructive review), opposition parties predominantly engage in bill obstruction and reducing the scope of bills by vetoing individual passages (destructive review). This article builds upon this finding and examines variation in the substance of opposition legislative review. Specifically, we argue that issue ownership explains opposition parties' choice between collaboration and obstruction of government bills. The paper argues that opposition parties will turn from destructive to constructive review in their prime issue areas in order to signal substantive engagement in those policy fields that are salient to their voter base. We evaluate this argument using an original dataset of legislative proceedings from two European parliamentary democracies. We rely on automated text analysis to distinguish between constructive and destructive review and adapt conventional measures of text similarity that shed light on the substance of legislative bargaining. The results hold important implications for opposition strategies in multiparty policymaking and the study of legislative review.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0046	230	Let the cobbler stick to his last? Determinants of party-issue saliency in sub-national politics	Elections are at the heart of representative democracies. However, while the study of national election campaigns is a prominent research field in comparative politics, we still know little about sub-national political actors’ behaviour. We start closing this gap by analysing issue salience in sub-national election manifestos in federalised countries. Our main argument revolves around the legally defined distribution of competences and the interdependence between the national and the state level. More specifically, we hypothesize that parties at the sub-national level will put more emphasis on topics for which they have the main legislative competences. Our research design takes the multi-level character of party competition at the regional level into account. We expect that a party’s government status at the national level, as well as the national electoral calendar affect sub-national parties’ issue emphasis in election manifestos. To test our hypotheses, we rely on a dictionary coding approach and analyse parties’ issue-based content of 610 sub-national election manifestos in Germany and Austria between 1990 and 2019. We find descriptive support for our expectation that German parties put more emphasis on regional topics than Austrian parties. The empirical results from our multivariate analyses corroborate this finding. Furthermore, we find support for our expectation that sub-national parties emphasise sub-national topics more when their national party organization is in government. These results have important implications for our understanding of the interdependence in European multi-level political systems.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0022	657	Awakening the Europhile Giant: EU Issue Competition after the Multiple Crises	After the outbreak of the Euro crisis, the study of the EU issue voting has received an increasing attention from scholars. Many works have showed how much the Eurosceptic parties have been more entrepreneurial on the EU dimension, increasing their voting shares on the EU issues. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that subsequent shocks (refugee crisis and the Brexit) had changed popular orientation towards Europe, probably making Euroscepticism less electoral profitable. This work posits a transformation in the direction of the EU issue voting, with the voters becoming more willing to support Europhile parties as compared to Eurosceptic ones along EU dimension (H1), awakening the so-calle Europhile Giant of European integration. Furthermore, the article examines the linkages between the party strategies and voter responses, hypothesising that the EU issue entrepreneurship has become more rewarding the pro-EU parties (H2a), while it has become a strategic hurdle for the anti-EU parties (H2b). This work analyses fifteen Western European democracies, observing the variations in party entrepreneurship and voting preference on the EU issues between 2014 and 2019. The results apitomises a pattern of a Europhile reaction in Western Europe, with the pro-EU parties increasingly realigning voters in their favour, by cueing the citizens the EU issue dimemsionality.

2021	0023	490	A new divide in New Europe: Deepening conflict over globalisation in Central and Eastern Europe	The paper seeks to understand and explain the changing nature of the political conflict in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Globalisation and immigration have emerged as major conflict dimensions all across Europe, structuring political competition and prompting heated debates. Its political consequences include the emergence and electoral success of anti-immigrant parties, polarised public discourse on culture and ethnicity, and restrictive immigration policies. In this context, CEE merits special attention because historically its political conflict structures have developed differently vis-à-vis the West, and because recent crises were experienced in dissimilar ways by Eastern and Western populations. Immigration is the key concern for CEE citizens (European Commission 2018), even though the countries are not major destinations for migrants and asylum seekers. The paper builds on the argument that in CEE, anti-globalisation and anti-immigration sentiments are an expression of defensive nationalism which is characteristic for the region. Rather than economically driven like in other parts of Europe, the globalisation conflict is expected to be culturally motivated. This hypothesis will be tested using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for ten new democracies in CEE. The study contributes towards an improved understanding of the globalisation backlash by offering novel theoretical explanations for the new political conflict in an understudied region in Europe.

2021	0036	390	A Europe of Minorities: Domestic Minority Status and Support for the European Union	The nation-state grants the highest status and the most opportunities to the country's titular nation. European integration challenges this traditional form of statehood. It erodes national boundaries and weakens the relationship between the state and the nation. It therefore possesses a strong normative appeal for national minority groups. In particular, we hypothesize that minority individuals have stronger support for European integration than the 'core nationals.' We test this rather simple, and yet largely overlooked, intuition using multiple rounds of the European Social Survey. Our empirical strategy relies on coarsened exact matching to identify suitable counterfactuals between minority and majority individuals. Results indicate a robust positive effect of minority status -- operationalized along legal, ethnic and linguistic traits -- on support for European integration. We further investigate the microfoundations of this effect and hypothesize that the impact of minority status on EU support works primarily through perceived discrimination. Finally, we analyze majority-minority differences in EU support among two groups of countries with peculiar dynamics of ethnic politics, that is states with large Russian minorities and multinational states with formal power-sharing arrangements. The results are entirely compatible with our theory. Altogether, our contribution demonstrates the importance of accounting for the broader social grouping of individuals in public opinion studies, and of nationalism in EU politics.

2021	0010	209	We are (almost) all internationalists now: How right-wing populism drives support for international economic integration in post-crisis Europe	In the last decade, political parties that are opposed to international economic integration (free trade, European integration, and immigration) have become increasingly electorally successful. However, public opinion surveys suggest that, at the same time, Europeans are becoming more supportive of international economic integration. How can we explain these diverging trends? In this paper, I argue that Europeans have become more internationalist over the last decade because they increasingly associate anti-internationalism with extremism. While right-wing populist parties initially rose to prominence on primarily anti-internationalist platforms in the wake of the eurozone crisis in Western Europe, they have increasingly de-emphasized anti-internationalism in favor of other issue areas, on which their positions are recognized as extreme. Media coverage that has amplified both anti-internationalism and extremism by right-wing populist parties has reinforced the association between them in the minds of individuals. As a result, individuals who reject the extremism associated with right-wing populist parties increasingly come to see anti-internationalism as a hallmark of extremists and therefore reject it as well. To test this argument, I conduct an original media analysis for nine Western European countries using supervised machine learning based on hand-coded newspaper articles. I combine the results from this analysis with Eurobarometer survey data to show the relationship between media discourse and support for international economic integration. This research has important implications for our understanding of public opinion towards international economic integration, as it suggests the need to contextualize individuals’ attitudes within the broader political discourse.

2021	0011	275	Party leaders beyond left-right ideology: How the decentralization dimension affects party leaders’ positions in countries with multilevel institutions.	How do party leaders manage diverse preferences over decentralization among party members’ positions? In countries with multilevel institutions, intra-party groups with different regional identities coexist, and these differences likely hold importance for leaders’ positions. Also, MPs from areas with distinct regional preferences seek to draw the party’s position over decentralization towards their region’s preference. The primary assumption is that national party leaders require support from the MP’s elected from high regional identity territories. Therefore, I predict that leaders adapt their speeches to account for position over decentralization depending on the presence of MPs from these regions to maintain their support. To predict the national party leader position on a territorial scale, I will use data from investiture speeches’ in Spain and the United Kingdom. I predict these positions using automated text analysis method Wordscores. I expect to find that the number of MP’s representing high regional identity territories influences the national party leader position over the issue of decentralization. These results hold new implications due to the inclusion of decentralization in the intra-party discussion. Moreover, I contribute to the study of speeches and quantitative text analysis using manifestos mentions over decentralization to establish the scale limits.	Comparative Politics
2021	0037	53	How Local Decentralization Contributes to Nation-State Building: Rethinking Ethnic Local Autonomy in Post-1949 China	While ethnic local autonomy has been considered as an institution of minority accommodation and conflict resolution, both why political leaders decide to introduce it in the first place and how their presence leads to political stability remain unclear. Drawing from the case of post-1949 China, I consider the granting of ethnic local autonomy in the context of authoritarian delegation. I argue that ethnic local autonomy, as an endeavor of local decentralization, allows the central leader to establish his supremacy over sub-national political elites while countering his inner-circle rivals. Using a novel index of elite connectedness and unique historical data on local political divisions, I find that Beijing is more likely to name EATs when the central leader faces a divided Politburo. EAT designations also tend to take place when the provincial Party secretary shares plenty of common knowledge more with the governor than with the central leader. Using an original dataset of district and county officials, I show that ethnic autonomous prefectures and counties are more likely to have ruling cadres appointed from the local communities than their non-EATs counterparts. Those in charge of sub-provincial EATs are also less likely to have worked with the provincial Party secretary. To extend the scope conditions, I assemble a cross-national dataset to study the presence of ethnic local autonomy in post-WWII authoritarian regimes. I conclude that one can consider ethnic local autonomy as an institution of agent control that can contribute to political centralization in multi-ethnic nation-states.	Comparative Politics
2021	0024	27	Strategic Inefficient Decentralization: Local and Regional Devolution As Substitutes	Decentralization to local governments may be inefficient, but most contemporary decentralization has occurred at the local (municipal) rather than regional (provincial) level. Why? We advance a theory highlighting the political incentives of central authorities to bypass the regional tier of government in favor decentralizing to smaller, more fragmented units. While regional decentralization can better take advantage of economies of scale and scope in public service provision, it also enables regional political opposition to scale more effectively. Central authorities may therefore have an incentive to forego the welfare benefits of regional decentralization in favor of the imperfect substitute of local decentralization, which provides some of the same benefits at less risk. Drawing on cases from Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, we discuss when and how strategic local decentralization can be an effective strategy to maintain political control in divided societies and when it is likely to fail.

2021	0038	290	Asymmetric Policies. Pandering and State-specific Costs of Mismatch in Political Agency	We study the implications of state-specific mismatch costs in a model of political agency with (possibly) biased politicians. We stress the importance of the interaction between the direction of the bias and the direction of the asymmetry in mismatch costs, both in determining the likelihood of a pandering equilibrium and its effect on voters' welfare. Our model builds on the political agency literature. We introduce one important modification, letting the cost of mismatch, i.e. the difference in voters’ payoff between choosing the right and the wrong policy, be state-specific. This allows us to show two sets of results, none of which would apply with symmetric policy mismatch costs. First, we show that pandering equilibria are more likely to be incentive compatible when the biased politician advocates ``high damage'' policies. Up to the point that, in our model, pandering can be ``benevolent'', i.e. an equilibrium even for purely policy motivated politicians, without office rents. Secondly, we show that voters may prefer to face biased politicians supporting the policy producing, if implemented when not appropriate, more extensive damages. We discuss the implications of those results for populism, environmental policies and special interest groups and the equilibrium incentives to over- or under-provide lockdowns or other mitigation measures.

2021	0025	598	Political Support, Cognitive Dissonance and Political Beliefs	Political polarization is one of the most debated topics in the world (Fiorina and Abrams, 2008). It shapes our political identities and the way we view a variety of aspects in life (e.g., the economy, general satisfaction with one’s nation). With the present research, we will answer the following question: 'Does political engagement in the form of expressing support causally impact political beliefs?' The present research addresses the limitations of the existing literature heads on. Firstly, we overcome the identification problem by relying on evidence from a novel, carefully designed experiment. The experiment crucially focuses on two factors that induce polarization via cognitive dissonance: the exerted effort to support a political candidate and the outcome of the election. Secondly, we will recruit a representative sample of citizens from the US via the panel company Dynata to increase the generazability of the results. Moreover, we will contribute to the existing literature conceptually by building a micro-founded model of political beliefs change and polarization with cognitive dissonance theory as its basis. Finally, we will test whether the changes in beliefs, induced by cognitive dissonance, have consequences on real decision by asking participants in the experiment to contribute to charitable organizations affiliated with various political camps. The results of the present research will deliver many important implications for how we organize our societies and how we interpret polarization.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0012	355	Does compulsory vote decreases polarization? Cross-national evidence using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)	Many scholars have analysed compulsory voting effects on inequality of turnout or even policy outcomes. However, its relationship with political polarization has not been addressed yet, despite frequent claims (including by high officials) that where turnout is optional extremists are more prone to vote. This paper fills this gap, providing evidence with survey data, mainly from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), on whether the of proportion of centrist voters (as compared to those that place themselves closer to the bounds of the 0-10 Left-Right scale) is higher in countries with compulsory vote. Although this is not, per se, an evidence of effects of compulsory/facultative vote in the ideological distribution of a country as a whole, understanding if there is an effect on polls could help explaining the vicious circles of polarization (where extremist voters elect extremist representatives, leading to political disaffection, hence more polarization among voters). It is also important to feed the frequent debates in many countries about changing from compulsory to facultative or vice-versa.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0100	35	Who Participates in Military Coups? Evidence from Argentina	Coups oust six times more autocrats than revolutions, while causing three out of four failures of democracy. Conventional wisdom holds that coups are, first and foremost, motivated by macro-organizational interests of the military. In contrast, we argue that personal interests drive individuals' active involvement in illegal power seizures. To explain why and which individuals conspire against their governments, we study the career prospects of individual officers. We expect that officers with little chance for promotion participate in coups to force their way up within the military organization. Using original data on all 7,400 serving officers in Argentina (1950-2007), we analyze biographic differences between all 480 coup plotters across the country's 18 coup attempts and the entire officer corps. We find that officers stuck within the military hierarchy and threatened with retirement were more likely to participate in coup attempts. The study demonstrates how organizational backlogs motivate soldiers to turn against their political leaders. This has implications for understanding the internal dynamics of political conspiracies, bureaucratic sabotage, and regime breakdowns.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0083	486	Who Sits Where? The Parliamentary Power Index and Committee Membership in 19 Countries	Recent advances in the availability of parliamentary data across countries, such as speeches or roll-call votes, have led legislative scholars to increase their focus on the attitudes and behavior of individual Members of Parliament (MPs). This allows us to have a better understanding of topics such as (re)selection, rebellion or compliance with the party line, leadership contests, and substantive representation of women. However, due to data restrictions, the distribution of power within parliamentary parties has often been restricted to a leadership-backbench dichotomy. We propose to go significantly beyond this definition. Parliamentary power is defined by both role and policy area: an MP who chairs the Budget and Taxes committee is certainly more prestigious within parliament and party than a backbencher who is member of the Sports committee. This has important implications for MPs' behavior in areas such as party loyalty, representation, and careers. By collecting original data on committee membership for 19 democracies between 1987 and 2020, and using a hierarchy across policy areas, we propose an index that captures the aggregate level of parliamentary power for each member of parliament in relation to their party: the Parliamentary Power Index. We show that this measure is cross-nationally comparable and demonstrate that the PPI is a valid and reliable measure, which correlates with other indicators of prestige. Moreover, by making available the original dataset with individual MPs' committee assignments across nineteen countries for more than three decades, we also provide researchers with an important tool to study legislators' behavior.

2021	0050	359	Reward or Punishment? Estimating the Distribution of Long-Run Returns to Political Office	What are the returns to a political career? Conditional on running for office, empirical studies have unilaterally found positive average returns to being elected for political office. In this study, we address three shortcomings. First, returns to office are likely heterogeneous where some Members of Parliament may experience negative or no returns although the average effect is positive. Second, the timing of returns can deviate e.g. due to lucrative pension schemes for politicians or future career options. Therefore, we take into account the net present value of life cycle income in order to account for income received after leaving office. Third, previous research has usually identified the returns to office conditional on running by comparing election winners to election losers, which ignores the investments candidates make in order to run for office. Based on administrative data for all candidates for parliamentary elections in Denmark from 1994 to 2015, we compare close winners and losers to find large positive returns to office conditional on running. However, quantile difference-in-difference estimates of returns to office reveals that those with high outside earning potential have no returns to office. Taking the value of long-run returns into account, holding office becomes even more lucrative. To identify the returns to choosing a political career, we use coarsened exact matching to find close matches in the population for each politician. We use a difference-in-difference strategy where we compare those who run for office to their population matches to identify the unconditional returns to a political career.

2021	0067	379	Returns to office among political amateurs	An inherent practical aspect of democratic rule is how politicians are rewarded for serving in office. Remunerations affect political recruitment, as they motivate some citizens to run for office, and recent studies suggest that serving in political office is financially beneficial in the short run and can be in the long run too. The existing studies mostly concern professional, full-time politicians who receive a full-time salary and leave the ordinary labor market while serving in office. Part-time politicians, on the other hand, make up a large share of the elected office-holders at subnational-levels, and are essential for public service provision in modern democracies. Being part-time officeholder take up time and energy, which on one hand might cause sacrifices in their ordinary professional job, but on the other hand provide a stepping stone for a political career and an opportunity for reaping local board memberships. I add knowledge about returns to political office of part-time politicians by studying local councilors in Denmark. I rely on administrative data linked to electoral data of the universe of political candidates in Danish municipality elections from 1993-2013. By comparing marginal winners and losers, I estimate that entering a part-time political position increase annual earnings by about €12.000 - a substantially large income increase, which is persistent for years until vanishing at last. As a second contribution, I link my data to novel administrative data on board memberships to better understand the dynamics and mechanisms underlying the substantially large returns enjoyed by the political amateurs.

2021	0084	649	The Electoral Consequences of Compulsory Voting: New Evidence from a Natural Experiment	Several quasi-experimental studies find evidence that higher voter turnout benefits left-wing parties, suggesting that an institutional fix like the introduction of compulsory voting could have serious political consequences. This study builds on, and moves beyond, this traditional class voting approach by presenting an alternative minimal effects view. It argues that instead of shifting the political power towards the left, compulsory voting helps mainstream parties - both on the left and on the right - to consolidate their power by weakening independent and minor party candidates. To test this theory, my study reanalyzes a critical case - Australia in the early 20th century - frequently cited as a strong demonstration of a clear positive effect of compulsory voting on the electoral success of left-wing parties. It leverages the fact that the introduction of compulsory voting laws at different points in time for state and Commonwealth elections in Australia represents an arguably exogenous shock to voter turnout. It improves on previous quasi-experimental research by using a unique dataset of more fine-grained electoral district election data in combination with a difference-in-differences design to provide a more direct empirical test of the assumed relationship. Findings from this analysis are broadly consistent with the minimal effects view and provide only limited support for the traditional class voting approach. This study sheds new light on the political consequences of an electoral reform that has gained increased traction among both academics and practitioners and represents an important corrective to the dominant class voting approach.

Voting age reductions tend to be implemented in lower-level elections first. If, for instance, a state election with voting age 16 takes place less than two years before a national election with voting age 18, some underage voters eligible for the former will have no right to vote in the latter. Analyzing a panel survey of young citizens from Germany, we find that under-age voters who were eligible in a state election in May 2017 experienced a decrease in external efficacy and satisfaction with democracy after not being eligible to vote in the national election five months later. Even after regaining eligibility in another subsequent election, the net effect of temporary disenfranchisement on external efficacy remains negative.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0101	268	Why does proportional representation benefit left-wing parties?	Electoral systems have an impact on parties and voters’ ideology as well as government policies. Iversen and Soskice (2006) showed that governments elected under proportional representation favour wealth redistribution policies, a connection that Döring and Manow (2017) attributed to the strategic behaviour of the middle class and the inefficient geographic distribution of left-wing voters. However, these two do not exhaust all the possible mechanisms that connect electoral systems to governments’ ideological orientation. In this paper, we argue that left-wing parties maximize votes, policies and offices under proportional representation, particularly when the mean average district is high, and its variance is small. To test these ideas, we introduce measures of alternative explanations such as malapportionment and differential voter mobilization across districts, as well as an explicit measure of voters’ ideology as a control. We rely on a database that combines data from different comparative sources and our own malapportionment measures, including elections from consolidated democracies since 1945.

2021	0068	591	Does new party entry increase electoral turnout? Quasi-experimental evidence from the 2015 local Spanish elections	Models of spatial voting and mobilization theory often imply that a larger number of parties should increase electoral turnout. Even though this hypothesis is well established in the political behaviour subfield, the most-up-to-date evidence arguably fails at identifying a causal effect. Employing time-series cross-sectional data, some studies show that electoral participation is higher when increasing the number of candidatures while others justify the opposite, i.e., that higher participation rates foster new party entry instead. To solve this endogeneity puzzle, I leverage a unique real-world setting that approximate the experimental ideal: the 2015 Spanish local elections. In those elections, the two newcomers Podemos and Ciudadanos run candidatures for the first time. However, they could not compete in many municipalities due to their lack of organizational roots. I, therefore, compare official participation records across these localities after matching them by a series of time-variant covariates within a difference-in-differences approach. The results provide a causal estimate of the effect of new party entry close to a 1% average increase on electoral turnout, robust to different specifications. This finding advises against the use of electoral participation rates as an explanatory variable in studies of new party entry, while it confirms previous findings on new party entry effects. More broadly, it contributes to the growing literature on the effects of supply-side changes on political behaviour. From a normative perspective, it also defies the conventional wisdom that increasing party system fragmentation and volatility have mostly a negative impact on indicators of democratic quality.

2021	0085	377	IMF Conditionality and Ownership: A Causal Mediation Analysis	The shifting emphasis on performance evaluation and accountability in the context of external conditionality programs has brought to the fore the question of local ownership of reforms. On the demand side of conditionality, a standard argument in the literature is that contracting governments often resort to external assistance in order to deflect the political costs of painful liberalization reforms and also to restore the country’s international image and credibility. On the supply side, the design of conditionality programs is either dictated by the foreign policy interests of the major donor countries (especially the US) or the policy agenda of international bureaucrats. However, the scope of conditionality, both with respect to the level of specificity, pace, and sequence of required reforms, conveys an informational content to the target government and thus influences the level of local ownership. In this paper, we first propose a counterfactual-based empirical operationalization and measurement of the concept of ownership using the synthetic control method (SCM) and then provide illustrative evidence on ownership over sector-specific reforms drawn from current databases on the design of IMF conditionality and de jure measures of economic globalization. Finally, we perform a causal mediation analysis to idenitfy the average causal mediating effect of ownership on policy implementation outcomes of de facto liberalization.

2021	0069	563	Trade Effects of Environmental Agreements: Uncovering De Facto Environmental Clubs	The creation of environmental clubs is a prominent policy proposal for addressing global environmental problems. By generating exclusive “club goods” for their members, environmental clubs provide an incentive to join them and accept their environmental obligations. Yet, the existing literature often considers intergovernmental environmental clubs as a promising theoretical idea that has still to be put into practice. This paper asks whether, in fact, the numerous International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) containing trade-related provisions provide club goods to their parties. This is the first study to investigate the effect of these provisions on trade flows among parties to an IEA compared to flows among non-parties. Making use of a novel dataset on the trade provisions of IEAs and a panel of worldwide bilateral trade flows, it finds that de facto environmental clubs are more prevalent than previously thought. The positive effect of certain trade provisions in an IEA can turn the trade-decreasing effect of the agreement into an overall trade-increasing effect. The paper also identifies specific trade provisions that show particular potential to contribute to the creation of a club good for the parties to the IEA. Studying the actual effects of IEA trade provisions is an important step in assessing the possibility of generating additional environmental clubs through trade incentives.

2021	0052	242	Do authoritarian regimes and democracies cooperate differently? Evidence from WTO negotiations.	Countries seem unable to agree on how international trade should be reformed. International trade negotiations are making headlines across the world in Europe, the United States and China. In this paper we are seeking to explain what makes countries more likely to cooperate in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Specifically, we investigate how the democratic status of two countries in a dyad, as well as their trade relationship influence how closely they cooperate, and whether the interaction between these two explanatory factors is able to provide more insights. In order to investigate this question, we analyse documents submitted by individuals or groups of WTO members between 2000 and 2012 in the Doha rounds negotiations. We code 1567 documents submitted on eight negotiation issues: agriculture, development, environment, intellectual property, non-agricultural market access, services, trade facilitation, and WTO rules. We then run hurdle models for overall cooperation and the eight issues, with the first stage (selection stage) capturing who cooperates with whom, and the second stage (allocation stage) modelling the amount of cooperation observed between dyads. We expect countries with similar regime types and dyads with higher trade flows to be more cooperative, and that these two effects reinforce each other.

2021	0102	484	Surveil and Advise: Do Article IV Consultations Improve Natural Resource Governance?	Can international organizations improve natural resource governance? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is most noted for its role in crisis lending, where it can wield the 'teeth'' of loan suspensions to push for reforms. But IMF officials also spend a large amount of time conducting routine surveillance through Article IV consultations, which assess a country's economic developments and provide non-binding recommendations. Do governments follow this 'toothless'' advice? We argue yes, though countries are more likely to take up the IMF’s advice when they rely on external finance and when they wish to remain in the IMF’s 'good graces.' In an analysis of all Article IV consultations published between 2004 and 2019, we find that when Article IV reports place more emphasis on natural resource governance resource-rich developing countries are more likely to adopt legislation to reform the oil, gas, and mining sectors. Our results suggest that technocratic consultation can lead to the adoption of policies that ameliorate the resource curse.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration

2021	0070	306	The Consequences of Model Misspecification for the Estimation of Non-Linear Interaction Effects	Recent research has shown that interaction effects may often be non-linear. As standard interaction effect specifications assume a linear interaction effect, i.e. the moderator conditions the effect at a constant rate, this can lead to bias. However, allowing non-linear interaction effects, without accounting for non-linear effects of other (control) variables, can also lead to biased estimates. Specifically, researchers can infer non-linear interaction effects, even though the true interaction effect is linear, when variables correlated with the moderator have a non-linear effect upon the outcome of interest. We illustrate this bias with Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical replication. We also provide guidance for researchers by assessing the performance of more fully specified models, estimated using regularised estimators to avoid overfitting, that can mitigate this bias. Doing so allows for more robust estimation of interaction effects, whether they be linear or non-linear in nature.	Political Methodology
2021	0053	284	Spatial Eigenfunction Modeling of Geo-Referenced Data in the Social Sciences	Many phenomenon of interest to social scientists exhibit some non-random spatial patterning, possibly at different spatial scales. While the geographic distribution of variables can reveal valuable information about underlying mechanisms of substantive interest, unaccounted spatial autocorrelation simultaneously causes severe problems for common econometric methods as it may lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. In order to safeguard against false inferences and to utilize the spatial information contained in a variable, it is imperative for quantitative social scientists to apply appropriate techniques. Against this background, this study introduces spatial eigenfunction analysis - particularly Moran eigenvector maps (MEM) - as a simple yet powerful tool to analyze cross-sectional data structures to political science. Based on the spectral decomposition of a transformed spatial connectivity matrix, this approach describes the spatial relationship in geo-referenced data based on eigenvectors which depict the full range of possible map patterns at different spatial resolutions. Simulation exercises demonstrate the utility and flexibility of spatial eigenfunctions for exploratory and inferential spatial analysis. More precisely, it facilitates the identification and visualization of multi-scale spatial patterns as well as the specification, estimation, and interpretation of inferential models involving spatial autocorrelation. This study concludes that spatial eigenfunction analysis broadens the spatial toolbox available to political scientists and allows practitioners to leverage the full range of statistical techniques suitable to appropriately analyze spatial data structures.

2021	0087	507	Framing Threat: The role of threat perception and online media in support for political violence in the US.	The effects of threat frames in media reports have been observed across numerous contexts such as civil war, crime, international relations, and race relations. These studies have largely focused on the more simplistic role of media producers and how audiences receive and decode the information. I take a more complicated approach by analyzing the relationship between media threat framings and calls for violence in comments sections which may influence other readers. This analysis considers the various forms of online media reporting including mainstream, alternative and social media depictions of both left and rightwing protests in the United States between 2016-2020. I do not attempt to make a causal link between threat frames, calls for violence and actual violence – however this research helps to explain how violence becomes normalized as part of political discourse. I create a large dataset by gathering online media reports related to high-profile political protests and their comments sections with custom Python 3 scripts. I then carry out a quantitative text analysis of this corpus using supervised machine-learning approaches. A variety of algorithms are used to classify reports based on the ideological position of the source, the group or cause behind the protest, the presence of threat framings, and calls for violence in the comments sections. I then analyze how calls for violence are influenced by the format of the media report (i.e., mainstream, alternative or social media), the ideological bias of the media source, and the protest’s cause.

2021	0071	447	More Electors, More Violence? Evidence from the Second Reform Act	How does an increase in the size of the electorate affect the use of violence during election campaigns? On the one hand, expanding the electorate might reduce violence by enabling citizens to vote rather than having to engage in contentious forms of politics. On the other hand, expanding the electorate increases its heterogeneity, which undermines clientelist networks and increases the total costs of bribery, making violence relatively more attractive. We investigate this theoretical puzzle in the context of the British Second Reform Act, which extended the franchise to the unskilled urban population in 1867 and thereby significantly increased the electorate in borough constituencies. Exploiting the sharp change in the size of the electorate, we isolate the effect of franchise extension from underlying constituency level traits correlated with the voting population, enabling us to get a better-identified estimate of the causal effect of franchise extension on election violence. Using an original dataset on election-related violent events in each parliamentary constituency at each general election between 1859 and 1880, drawn from historical newspaper and parliamentary committee reports, we find that the reform resulted in an increase rather than a decrease in electoral violence in the subsequent election. Looking at the subsequent two general elections, we observe that this increase in violence is sustained, suggesting that franchise extension has contributed to a new more violent electoral equilibrium. Our findings contribute to debates within the electoral violence, democratization, and the electoral reform literature.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0103	254	Party Development and Election Violence: Evidence from Nineteenth Century England and Wales	How does the development of political parties impact the chances of elections becoming violent? Despite increasing recognition of the deleterious consequences of election violence, and increasing research on the causes of such violence, there is limited research on the role of party development in limiting or encouraging it. Leveraging new, comprehensive and constituency-level data on election violence in nineteenth-century England and Wales, we highlight how the initial development of political parties can, in certain political and institutional contexts, increase election violence. We focus on the impact of party slates – campaign coalitions between candidates from the same party – in the plurality double-member districts that prevailed in England and Wales during this period. We theorise that when candidates entered these local party slates, which formed a stepping stone toward nationally organised parties, election violence became a more attractive campaign tactic because its costs could be split without its electoral benefits to each slate-member being diminished. In support of this argument, we show that, controlling for national trends and constituency characteristics, the formation of party slates tended to be associated with increased pre-election violence, particularly of types likely to be the product of elite strategic direction. In further mechanism tests, we show that this relationship is unlikely to be driven by a growth in mass partisanship, and find some evidence that, consistent with our argument, violence served to reduce split-voting. Our findings highlight the contingent impact of party development on political development.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0054	533	Violence and Voting Behavior: Evidence from the Case of Turkey-PKK Conflict	How does political violence affect voting behavior? In order to answer this question, I examine the impact of fatalities in Turkey's PKK conflict between 2015 and 2018 on voting behavior in Turkey in both parliamentary and local elections. Using an original, district-level dataset on the location of state security forces, civilian and insurgent fatalities, I study how both the presence and the number of fatalities affect support for political parties: I focus on the incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP), the Turkish nationalist action party (MHP), and the Kurdish party (HDP). I find that fatalities increase the vote share of the Turkish nationalist party and lowers the support for the opposition Kurdish party. I also find mild increase in support for the incumbent JDP in conflict-affected districts. The robustness checks show that these findings can't be explained only by potential irregularities in the counting of votes, the deployment of nationalist security forces and their families to the conflict-affected areas, and out-migration of particular groups from conflict-affected areas. Overall, these findings contribute to a growing body of research that show that conflict can increase the vote share of right-wing, nationalist parties while it lowers public support for parties that are aligned with the political goals of insurgents.

2021	0072	236	Do Politicians’ Personality Characteristics Influence Their Decision Making on Multiple Dimensions?	The lion share of decisions by politicians is risky in that their outcomes are unknown. While the literature on politicians’ decision making under risk is extensive, it typically focuses only on decision making in one dimension. Yet, many decisions by politicians involve trade-offs in multiple dimensions, for instance the economy vs. electoral standing; or the economy vs. public health. Such decisions are difficult, but there is only limited empirical evidence on how politicians make them. Since politicians’ decisions are often both consequential for themselves and for others, this is a major lacuna. Therefore, this study will examine to what extent politicians’ personality characteristics influence how they make decisions involving trade-offs in multiple dimensions. To this end, we will conduct a survey experiment with a large sample of Norwegian elected local politicians that allows us to examine how they make decisions under risk that involve trade-offs between data privacy and the (local) economy. The survey also includes a module on personality characteristics, using the HEXACO Personality Inventory that defines six personality factors (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness). We hypothesize that especially the Honesty-Humility domain that is characterized by sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance and modesty will influence how politicians make decisions with multiple dimensions. Hereby, our study’s findings will contribute to the growing, yet still relatively scant, literature on the influence of politicians’ personality characteristics on their decision making.

2021	0055	631	Affective Polarization in Europe. A Crossnational Conjoint Experiment.	We design a novel experiment to explore the multidimensional foundation of partisanship in Europe. Partisanship is considered as a key mechanism of affective polarization with increasing hostility and distrust across party lines between in- and outgroups. Combining a conjoint experiment with decision-making games from behavioral economics we examine the cleavage structure of in- and outgroup behavior in a broad cross-national context of 25 European countries. In these countries, a new conflict around European integration is complementing the traditional left versus right conflict in party competition. We find a dominance of partisanship in relation to other traditional cleavages such as social class and religion, which intensifies affective polarization not only on the classical left right but also the new European integration dimension. We also find surprising importance of EU attachment what we call European identity, which goes beyond nationality. While in-group favoritism exerts a bigger influence than out-group derogation for partisanship, things are the other way around for EU attachment, with stronger effect of out-group derogation.

2021	0088	401	Party responsiveness to public opinion in a multi-dimensional policy space	Party responsiveness to public opinion is a key question in the study of democratic representation. While numerous studies have examined party responsiveness on the broad ideological dimensions, there is less comparative research on when and how parties respond to public opinion on more specific issue dimensions. This represents an important shortcoming in our understanding of party responsiveness in the context of partisan realignment and dealignment in European democracies. We aim to address this research gap by studying party positional responsiveness on eight issue dimensions. We conceptualise party responsiveness as parties adjusting their positions to eliminate previous incongruence between themselves and the central point in the voter preference distribution. Our empirical analysis combines the 2014 and 2019 Chapel Hill Expert Surveys and the 2014 European Election Study data. We find moderate levels of party responsiveness on all issue dimensions. Parties are more responsive to their supporters than to the general electorate. In the subsequent analyses we examine how party issue salience and other issue and party characteristics condition party responsiveness.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0073	185	Legislating gender equality: State-mandated academic gender quotas and the representation of women in academia	How do state-mandated gender quotas in academia impact different types of gender inequality in higher education? This study explores the effects of legal gender quotas in a context heretofore overlooked by the gender quota literature: academia. We adopt theories of representation from political science to use as a lens through which to hypothesize on systemwide differences quotas might make. Using data from 28 European and European-associate countries, this study observes how quotas correlate with the increased presence of women on boards, and how they interact with the number of women on boards to affect gender equality in academic staff. We find that these legislated quotas succeed in increasing the rate of women on academic boards. Their interaction with the number of women on boards does not alter the connection between women on boards and women's representation in other areas of academia. This means that despite concerns of a backlash, quotas do not alter the effects women have when entering leadership and decision-making positions. While academic quotas seem to conform to expectations as presented in political models of representation, they differ from political quotas when it comes to the importance of mechanisms of enforcement in quota design.

2021	0056	196	Multidimensional Women’s Representation	The larger part of research on women’s representation has addressed substantive and descriptive aspects of representation. We build on this work and extend it by investigating additional, hitherto largely neglected dimensions of women representation. Building on the 'Multidimensional Representation' research agenda, we operationalise four additional forms of women representation using the case of the UK's political system with single-member districts: 1) Surrogation: the degree to which female voters and female MPs build representative relationships across constituencies to correct for male dominance in representation; 2) Justification: the degree to which female voters demand, and female MPs use, pluralist as opposed to republican arguments when giving voice to the interests of women; 3) Personalisation: the degree to which female voters demand female MPs to act independently of their party, and female MPs propensity to do so; 4) Responsiveness: the degree to which female voters demand female MPs to react to the threat of electoral sanctions, and female MPs actual reactivity. We derive several hypotheses about women’s representation on these dimensions, pertaining to female voters as well as female MPs. In particular, we highlight how representation on these dimensions is theoretically related to descriptive and substantive representation as well as political ideology (esp. progressivism). Testing these hypotheses with original survey data from the UK 2019 general election and text-as-data approaches on MPs' legislative speeches, we find support for several hypotheses. Our results provide a much richer and comprehensive picture of women’s representation.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0089	297	How Men debate Women's Concerns - The importance of Individual Gender Representation in Parliamentary Debates across Political Issues	The question if women represent women in parliament is central for the evaluation of representation and policy interventions. In parliaments, politicians shape how men and women are represented in decision-making and public discussion. Gender differences at almost all stages of the policy-making process have been investigated. Research at the aggregate level has often focused on the link between women’s descriptive and their substantive representation, i.e., the presence of women in parliament and policy output that is congruent with women’s interests or policy preferences. We ask how women represent women across political topics in parliamentary speech. We use a semi-supervised topic model trained on coded UK election manifestos to categorize text and estimate its ‘female focus’. Based on the empirical analysis of 1,200,000 speeches in the British House of Commons from 1989-2019, we use word embeddings to identify terms associated with women in common contexts. We develop an empirical measure of femininity to score parliamentary speeches. Based on this measure, we identify “female issues” inductively. We show that while issues like social welfare, families and health are “feminin”, many economic and foreign affairs issues are too. We find that even after we control for age, party and topic, women still communicate more focused on women. Men on the other hand talk much more about male aspects, even inside issues that are considered “female”. This supports the argument that in parliamentary speech, women are more likely to address women concerns, even inside traditionally female issues and underlines the importance of descriptive representation.

2021	0041	241	Party Cues and Support for Common European Debt: Experimental Evidence of In- and Out-Party Cues in Five Countries	Does information on parties' position on European integration affect citizen support? Observational research on European Union (EU) politics has long argued that political parties can cue public support for EU policy. Experimental evidence of party cueing effects on citizen support for European integration is mixed, however. We argue that these inconsistent findings are a product of measuring party positions imprecisely. In addition, while research from highly polarized bipartisan contexts shows that both in-party and out-party cues affect citizens' attitudes, it is unclear whether such in- and out-party dynamics hold in less polarized, multi-party contexts. To address these issues, we conduct a survey experiment in which we leverage an actual roll-call vote in the European Parliament to measure party positions on debt mutualization in the European pandemic recovery fund in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Using parties' voting behavior allow us to anchor unambiguous party cues provided in the experiment to a specific real-world situation. The survey experiment is fielded in five EU member-states using nationally representative samples: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain (N=7500). We find that cues both in- and out-party cues have a statistically significant effect on support for debt mutualization. In-party cues shift preference in the direction congruent with the party position, while out-party cues have the opposite effect.	Political Communications
2021	0002	574	Partisan Cues Dominate Ideological Preferences in Policy Appraisal. Experimental Evidence	A lot of scholarly attention has been devoted to political polarization in the American public. One account describes the cleavage as ideological, namely revolving around divergent policy preferences of different partisans. A different explanation holds that party labels are strong heuristics that voters use to adjust their policy preferences to their party. As there is usually a reasonable fit between the partisanship of the policy promoter and the policy goal, it is difficult to discern which is a stronger driver of policy evaluation and opinion formation: partisan cues or ideological preferences? Using an original experiment that includes both policy content and partisan sponsorship as distinct and orthogonal attributes of policy proposals, I test the extent to which Democrats and Republicans are driven by policy preferences and partisan cues. I find that across an array of domains, the content of the policy has virtually no effect on the preferences of different partisans. This holds even on issues pertaining to key ideological divides such as taxation. Instead, I find that partisan cues have major effects on respondents' views on a given policy. The one exception are policies dealing with moral issues – e.g. euthanasia and pornography consumption – which seem to be driven by both policy considerations and partisan cues. Overall, these findings suggest that polarization on policy issues is also an outcome, and not just a cause, of partisanship in the US public sphere.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0048	118	How do voters form perceptions of party positions?	Two key conflict dimensions structure the European policy space: a socio-economic and a socio-cultural dimension. Despite myriad research locating parties in this space, we know relatively about voters’ perceptions of parties’ policy positions: how do voters form perceptions of party policy positions on the economic and socio-cultural issue dimension? Such a task is a difficult one for voters, as they need to arrive at a summary judgment concerning a higher-level dimension based on information on specific issues. Moreover, parties tend to have quite different positions on the individual issues attributed to both dimensions. For example, they may be in favour of gay marriage but oppose a liberal immigration regime; in this case, where should the party be placed on a liberal-authoritarian dimension? One aid to voters could be the emphasis parties put on each issue, so whether they talk more about their stance on gay marriage or that on immigration. In this paper, we therefore test whether the emphasis a party places on a topic matters for how voters perceive party positions on higher-level dimensions. Using two survey experiments (n=3.000), we present respondents with short and long statements on two issues and examine whether the length of statements affects positional perceptions for the socio-cultural and for the economic dimension, even if the policy stance of the statement is the same. The empirical results show support for our hypotheses and have important implications for party competition and political representation.	Political Communications
2021	0028	349	What's in a Cue? How Citizens Infer Policy Information from Party Cues	When citizens learn the policy position of their party they appear to ignore information about the content of policy. This has led to the view, widespread among public opinion scholars, that party cues are in contrast to policy information. In this article, we provide theory and evidence that challenge this understanding in one important way: A party cue could---in and of itself---lead citizens to draw relevant inferences about the content and immediate consequences of policy. Across four experiments conducted on different policy areas with different party sponsors, we show that citizens 'see' substantially different policies depending on the policy reputation of the sponsoring party. When citizens follow the policy position of their party this behavior could be grounded in much more policy-relevant considerations than revealed in existing research, suggesting a less bleak interpretation of party cue effects.

2021	0015	50	Partisanship, Elite Cues, and Support for Public Health Policies in Germany and the United States	Most political issues receive little attention from the public and policymakers. How does the public come to hold their views on such low salience issues? Is public opinion responsive to cues from co-partisan political elites? Or are attitudes still structured by underlying partisan loyalties or other individual characteristics? This study addresses these questions by conducting two original, representative surveys in the United States and Germany. A series of survey experiments test the extent to which public opinion toward obesity- and tobacco-related public health policies is responsive to elite cues from Green Party-SDP coalition and CDU/CSU politicians in Germany and Democratic and Republican politicians in the United States. The experiments indicate relatively little responsiveness, and they show some indication of backlash for cues from political leaders of opposing parties. The findings contribute to understanding of popular attitudes toward obesity-related public health policies and low salience policy issues more generally.	Comparative Politics
2021	0104	270	The Gendered Assessment of Public Opinion	How accurately can representatives assess the policy preferences of female and male citizens? Given that almost all parliamentary democracies channel the preferences of their citizens through elected representatives, male and female parliamentarians should be equally able to correctly estimate the policy preferences of the entire electorate. Personal biases of representatives may lead to inaccurate perceptions about what citizens want and cause representational inequalities of certain social groups. We investigate the role of gender in this regard and analyze to what extent female and male representatives have accurate views about men’s and women’s policy preferences. Theoretically, we expect that female parliamentarians are better able to assess the policy preferences of women. Since female representatives share gender-specific experiences with the female population, they should have a more accurate view of women’s policy positions compared to their male colleagues. This effect should be stronger for policy issues that are usually characterized as “soft” or “feminine”. Empirically, we test these expectations using original data from surveys with political elites and symmetrical population surveys in Germany and Switzerland. Including representative’s estimates of their electorate’s opinion with regard to eight different policy areas, the results confirm our hypotheses. Mediation analyses of the causal mechanism show that gendered differences in elite’s perceptions of public opinion are not driven by representatives’ personality traits. We rather show that the perceptual accuracy of female representatives increases if their electoral vulnerability is high.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0057	474	Dynamic Responsiveness in Political Rhetoric	According to the Thermostatic model of representation, the government updates its policies in response to the public, and in return, the public updates its preferences in response to government policy. We seek to expand the applicability of this model to the analysis of political rhetoric. First, we propose to analyze rhetorical responsiveness regarding the attention to specific issues, such as immigration and environment. Second, in addition to issue attention, we also analyze ideological placement in speeches as a means of responsiveness. To this end, we develop a manifesto-based dictionary with a guided word embeddings approach to ideologically separate MPs’ speeches. In addition, we use a perceptual measure of public opinion using weekly opinion polls that report the public's party preferences. Third, we combine public opinion, speech and electoral data to evaluate the dynamic responsiveness between MPs and the public. In sum, the goal is to expand the relevance of the Thermostatic Model as a theory of democratic responsiveness.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0090	392	The plenary attention deficit disorder: Do legislators pay less attention to their female colleagues?	We study differences in the attention that legislators pay to speeches delivered by their male and female colleagues. Drawing on unique video footage of the plenary proceedings in a large German state parliament over the course of one year, we are able to systematically gauge legislators' reactions to the speeches of their colleagues using automated video analysis. To measure attention, we first train a face detection and a face recognition model to identify all legislators in the assembly. Second, we use pose detection to assess whether legislators pay attention to the floor proceedings. This results in a continuous measure of the behavior of all members in the chamber which we match with information on the current speaker. Initial results suggest that male legislators enjoy higher levels of attention when delivering a speech compared to their female colleagues. The attention deficit for female speakers is more pronounced among male legislators and moderated by partisanship. Our study seconds efforts of female legislators to draw attention to their unequal treatment in the execution of their offices. Doing so, we contribute to a growing literature on the marginalization of women in legislative institutions. On a more general level, our results inform a research program on gendered power inequities by studying differences in legislative behavior on the basis of observational data with an unprecedented scope. Methodologically, the study adds to an emerging literature that uses computer vision for political science research.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0074	26	The Expertise Curse: How Policy Expertise Can Hinder Responsiveness	We argue that policy expertise may constrain the ability of politicians to be responsive. Legislators with more knowledge and experience in a given policy area have more confidence in their own issue-specific positions. Enhanced confidence, in turn, may lead legislators to discount opinions they disagree with. Two experiments with Swedish politicians support our argument. First, we find that officials with more expertise in a given domain are more likely to dismiss appeals from voters who hold contrasting opinions, regardless of their specific position on the policy, and less likely to accept that opposing views may represent the majority opinion. Consistent with the proposed mechanism, in a second experiment we show that inducing perceptions of expertise increases self-confidence. The results suggest that representatives with more expertise in a given area are paradoxically less capable of voicing public preferences in that domain. The study provides a novel explanation for distortions in policy responsiveness.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0091	538	Issue Responsiveness in the European Parliament: The Causal Effect of Institutional Change on Behaviour of MEPs	In the course of the 8th European Parliament, its Members (MEPs) were exposed to the novel rules that set limits for the number of written questions they can ask. Faced with limitations to draw attention to political issues as well as to send signals to the domestic audiences, since then MEPs have to strategically choose which issues to emphasize. In this paper, I examine the rationales driving the MEPs' choice of the issues they draw attention to. I argue that the rule change, coupled together with the increasing EU politicization and its growing salience in domestic electoral politics, shapes the patterns of issue emphasis shown by the MEPs from the Eurosceptic and non-Eurosceptic parties. As their ability to represent domestic interests on the European level became more noticeable domestically, while opportunities to do so became scarcer, I argue that after the rule change non-Eurosceptic MEPs have shifted their focus to the issues that their domestic parties regard as more salient. The same is not expected for the Eurosceptic MEPs, as they rather benefit from the EU politicization and have less incentives to change the way they utilize written questions. To test the theoretical framework, I rely on the difference-in-difference approach and compare issue emphasis in the questions of Eurosceptic and non-Eurosceptic MEPs during the 7th and 8thparliamentary terms. The results bear important implications for understanding the effects that institutional change may have on the behaviour of legislators and in particular on their responsiveness to party issue priorities.

2021	0058	245	How proposal complexity conditions report allocation in the European Parliament	The legislative empowerment of the European Parliament (EP) has augmented the importance of committee rapporteurs as the institution’s key representatives in inter-institutional negotiations. As a result, the question of who becomes rapporteur has received quite some attention in studies of EU legislative politics and existing studies largely argue that report allocation can be explained by characteristics of the individual legislators (e.g. their experience, education, and ideological extremeness). Yet, the implicit assumption in the literature is that all of these explanations work independently from the actual policy substance of the legislative proposal to which the draft report pertains. In this study, we challenge this assumption and investigate the extent to which the explanatory power of legislator characteristics is conditioned by the complexity of the underlying legislative proposal. We hypothesize that more experienced, educated and moderate Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are not only more likely to become rapporteurs (as shown by the existing literature), but that they draft their reports on substantively different and more complex policy proposals than their less experienced, less educated and more extreme peers. The empirical analysis of this claim is based on an original dataset combining information on the complexity of 4,000 legislative proposals issued by the European Commission between 1994 and 2020 with information on the corresponding EP rapporteurs. Our study thereby contributes an important missing puzzle piece to the growing literature on legislative organization in the European Parliament by highlighting the role of proposal complexity for the report allocation process.

2021	0075	210	Emotive Rhetoric, Political Ideology and Central Bank Accountability in the European Parliament	Do elected officials employ emotive rhetoric to hold technocrats accountable? In this article, we hypothesise that political ideology plays an important role in explaining politicians' use of emotive rhetoric when exercising democratic scrutiny over the policies of independent central banks. To test this proposition, we use a novel dataset of the hearings of the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from 1999 to 2020. We measure of emotive rhetoric with well-established sentiment dictionaries developed in different scientific domains. To measure the ideological stances of MEPs, we rely on expert-based classifications of European and national party positioning in the left-right spectrum and on European integration. The article provides evidence that ideologically extreme, anti-EU politicians are significantly more likely to employ a negative rhetoric when addressing the ECB than moderate, pro-EU MEPs. Our results are robust across different measures of emotive rhetoric and have important implications to understand the changing nature of political pressures on independent central banks.

2021	0059	293	Regional labor markets and the politics of resentment	While the relationship between economic factors and 'cultural backlash' remains highly contested in political science, studies show that both anti-immigration sentiment and radical right support vary considerably within countries. Regional economic conditions seem to correlate with both anti-immigration attitudes and radical right voting but the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships remain largely unknown. In this paper, we argue that the interplay of individual skill sets and differences in regional labor markets helps explain these phenomena. Following a literature on geographical concentration of firms in economics, we assume that it is efficient for firms to rely on highly specific skills to concentrate geographically, thus generating skill-based population clusters and raising the bar to inter-territorial relocation. We expect that the shrinking or collapse of regional economic clusters has distinct effect on anti-immigration sentiment and radical right support, over and beyond residential self-selection into such clusters that may explain initial regional patterns. The shrinking or collapse of regional sectors induces acute economic stress for affected workers. Whereas workers with high skill transferability and high employability can mitigate the medium-term consequences through occupational change or relocation, others are left in precarious positions. We test our argument using geo-referenced panel data from the GSOEP in combination with detailed information on the dynamics of regional (county-level) labor markets, obtained through original aggregations of data from the German microcensus. This rich and novel data base also allows us to contrast our proposed mechanism with alternative economic or psychological explanations.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0092	460	The Exit Option: an analysis of how ethnopolitical exclusion motivates emigration desires from sub-Saharan Africa	What are the political drivers of migration from sub-Saharan Africa and what role does ethnopolitical exclusion play in shaping migration decisions? Commonly cited explanations of voluntary migration focus on economic conditions in the home country as push-factors, whereby individuals emigrate in search of economic opportunity (Borjas, 2016). However, despite decreasing levels of poverty since the 1990s (Fosu, 2014), sub-Saharan Africa has some of the fastest growing levels of voluntary emigration (AfCSS, 2017). Thus, conventional explanations cannot sufficiently explain existing patterns of migration. Ethnicity is the main political and social cleavage in nearly all African states and creates limitations to opportunity because resources and job opportunities are patrimonially distributed. This paper explores the relationship between ethnopolitical exclusion and emigration desires by first testing the direct relationship and then by employing a causal mediation analysis to test how grievance participates as a mediator in the relationship. To test this, I use Afrobarometer Round 7 data and Harkness (2019)’s Ethnic Stacking database. The results show that there is no statistically significant relationship between ethnopolitical exclusion and emigration desire; however, there is a positive and statistically significant causal mediation effect when accounting for the role of grievance. The results indicate that grievance fully mediates the relationship between ethnopolitical exclusion and emigration desires, suggesting ethnopolitical exclusion may invoke emigration desires when accounting for the role of grievance.

2021	0110	632	Does learning about the economic benefits of immigration update people's policy preferences?	The labor market hypothesis has been recently increasingly dismissed as an explanation for immigration preferences, noting that people oppose immigration more based on cultural reasons than economic ones. However, an increasing body of literature is showing that immigration is in many ways benifitial for the economies of the receiving communities. Is the economic argument more salient if the respondents are aware of these positive externalities of immigration? We test this by administering a survey experiment in the UK, where respondents are primed to various degrees of the positive economic consequences of granting work permits to asylum seekers. Results show that informing respondents about asylum seekers taking jobs that are unwanted by the locals increases support for granting asylum seekers work permits. This effect is more pronounced among respondents who voted 'Leave' in the EU referendum, indicating that the narrative of the economic benefits also works for people who are otherwise opposed to immigration.

2021	0076	327	Open borders versus inclusive membership? Explaining the association between immigration and citizenship regimes	Do inclusive societies need closed borders? The classical view in political theory and much empirical research argue that openness in immigration and inclusiveness in citizenship indeed trade off. This paper reformulates the underlying puzzle in a general way: How are Immigration Regime Openness (IRO) and Citizenship Regime Inclusiveness (CRI) associated? I claim is that this association depends upon the politicization of immigration and its changing meaning for the transformation of party politics across time. When immigration is politicized in more recent historical periods, the politics of immigration and citizenship align along a new cultural cleavage that pits nativists seeking closure against cosmopolitans seeking openness in both territorial and membership boundary-making. This is boundary politics. It should manifest in a positive correlation between IRO and CRI. I argue further that immigration and citizenship regimes are relatively closed and exclusive when nativist party power is strong and relatively open and inclusive when it is weak. Contexts with low politicization lack boundary politics and should instead exhibit no systematic correlation between IRO and CRI. I test this framework by combining quantitative analyses across 23 democracies 1980-2010 with evidence from case studies of five reforms across three countries. Corroborating most propositions of the boundary politics framework, the findings not only advance our empirical understanding of the context-dependent links between immigration and citizenship politics, but also bear important implications for the long-standing normative debate on the topic. Most importantly, they can rejuvenate theoretical efforts going beyond the widespread trade-off assumption, which this paper falsifies.	Comparative Politics
2021	0105	586	Implementation Leeway in the Dublin System: How Efficiency Considerations Influence Dublin Procedures in Switzerland	The strategic (non-)implementation of EU rules is an important topic in the EU literature. During the European migration crisis, several member states have deviated from the clear rules set out by the legal framework of Schengen and Dublin. While the political controversies around these deviations have attracted much attention, member states' national authorities also have some implementation leeway in everyday decision-making. Little is known about this leeway and whether, how, and why member states use it. The Dublin system allows countries to send asylum seekers in an 'outgoing procedure' when they conclude that another Dublin state is responsible for the person in question. Focusing on this administrative decision, I argue that for efficiency reasons, national authorities specialize in asylum seekers from countries of which they already have a large share of residents. Asylum seekers from these countries are less likely to be sent in an 'outgoing procedure'. Empirically, the probability of such a procedure for an applicant is calculated with a multilevel model, using register panel data from Switzerland. The preliminary results support the main arguments. By shedding light on how the strategic implementation of rules may lead to imbalances in the distribution of asylum seekers, these findings have broader implications for the Dublin system.

In this study, we argue that creating new social and political rules for behaviour like mask wearing – behaviour that is individually practiced but has collective benefits – is akin to designing new formal and informal institutions in response to a sudden and severe crisis. What drives public acceptance of these new rules? Using a vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey conducted during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, we examine the effects of information about the virus and public authority on people’s beliefs about the desirability of the rules, which rules they prefer, who should make them, and how they should be enforced. We argue that information about the individual and collective risks of non-compliance will induce citizens to accept new rules and enforce them, especially if the information comes from a trusted source. Results show that simply providing such information indeed heightens people’s willingness to create new and stringent rules and to enforce them vigorously. However, compliance with new rules is not a partisan matter or connected to allegiance to political authority: we find no significant differences in people’s preferences between supporters of the government or opposition parties. Our results suggest that citizens are easily persuaded to accept new and intrusive restrictions on private behaviours for the benefit of society as a whole.

We evaluate the short- and medium-term impacts of lockdown policies on civic attitudes relevant for the health of democracy. Using survey data collected daily between March and May 2020 in the United States and Europe from 27,317 respondents, we document that lockdown policies give rise to authoritarian attitudes and, to a lesser degree, support for autocracy. We find little evidence that lockdown policies affect satisfaction with democracy and the government, out-group hostility, and generalized trust. Additional analyses reveal that the effects on authoritarian attitudes and support for autocracy persist for at least six weeks, that the lifting of lockdown policies does not have a countervailing effect away from authoritarianism and support for autocracy, and that economic support packages have limited ability to alleviate the negative consequences of lockdowns on civic attitudes. Together, these findings confirm the existence of lockdown's political repercussions, but show the need for a nuanced assessment of their breadth and depth. We discuss the implications of our findings for how governments need to accompany lockdowns with measures that strengthen democratic attitudes and civic culture.

Do voters “rally around” incumbent candidates, or is it mostly right-wing candidates who profit from the external threat posed by the coronavirus? We address these questions focusing on the unique case of the French municipal elections that took place in March and June 2020, while Covid-19 cases were spreading across the country. We combine voting data at the municipality level with the excess mortality rate that is plausibly related to Covid-19 in the same municipalities to exploit the geographical variation in the diffusion of the virus. Preliminary results based on diff-in-diff analysis indicate that support for incumbent candidates increased in the areas that were strongly affected by the coronavirus. However, it is mostly right-wing, incumbent candidates – and not other incumbents – who profit from the spread of Covid-19 in terms of increased vote share.

Exploring party loyalty during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis in Sweden and Denmark	How strong is party loyalty when going through a severe crisis like the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic? Using unique and identical panel data from Sweden and Denmark, collected during the Covid-19 first wave in the spring and early summer of 2020, I explore the stability of party loyalty as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic. While being very identical universal welfare states on central parameters as well as both possessing a social democratic government in place at the time of the Covid-19, Sweden and Denmark nevertheless opted for two very different pandemic strategies when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Where Denmark opted for a rigid lockdown, Sweden remained mostly open, resulting in death tolls that differed increasingly during the first wave of the pandemic. I explore if these different contexts mattered for party loyalty in the two countries, and how this might have shifted as the pandemic unfolded in the summer 2020, yielding different death tolls in the two countries.

At the beginning of the pandemic, here were concerns that old age and family care duty may affect some MPs’ ability to discharging their function as representatives under the unprecedented circumstances. Using speech data from Hansard, this paper will analyse to what extend has age and familial status affected MPs participation during the pandemic and to what extend has the hybrid proceedings mitigated that. Moreover, hybrid proceedings and social distancing rules have significantly affect the working environment of the House by reducing the number of members present in the chamber and allowing remote contributions made through videoconferencing. Through textual analysis of data from Hansard, this paper would further explore if these changes of context under hybrid proceedings has affected the content and tone of parliamentary debate during the pandemic. Not only would these results shed light on whether the parliament was able to maintain its representativeness under the challenges of the pandemic, but it will also discover if and how remote contributions may affect the work of parliament should this become part of the proceeding moving forward.

2021	0094	211	Managing Electoral Threats: Understanding Communication Efforts of Governing Parties During the European Migration Crisis	Engaging with the literature of issue competition and political communication, this paper investigates whether the intensification of a crisis increases issue salience by studying the relationship between the extent of the migration and public and political communication about migration in several European countries. In order to better understand the mechanisms shaping government responses to crises, this paper investigates two dimensions of issue salience. The first dimension examines the extent to which governments devote attention to the crisis based on the actual extent of the policy challenge. The second dimension considers how governments respond to public perception about the crisis by investigating whether governments engage more with the crisis topic as the voters are more dissatisfied about the problems posed by the crisis. To devise a measure of government attention to migration, this study quantitatively codes speeches from prime ministers and presidents of European countries available in the EUSpeech dataset (Schumacher and Berk 2020) using unsupervised topic modelling. The intensity of the crisis is measured by looking at the inflow of asylum seekers. Public discontent related to migration is conceptualised by a sentiment analysis of tweets that concern the topic of migration. These two measures are then regressed on the level of issue attention using mixed effects regression models.The findings indicate that governments respond to negative public perceptions of the crisis, but not to the extent of the policy challenge. The findings illustrate the importance for future research to separate and examine multiple dimensions of issue salience.	Political Communications
2021	0061	642	Public Opinion, Legislative Production and Government Responsiveness	In parliamentary democracies, while designing and enacting public policies, the government potentially faces a trade-off between following its own policy preferences, or to address voters’ preferences, when they are not aligned. Nevertheless, there is a direct connection between the preferences of governments and citizens via public opinion. How does public opinion influence governments' legislative decision-making and its choice of legal instrument (type of law)? Despite the institutional dynamics within parliamentary democracies (majority type, political competition or institutional veto-players) we show that public opinion has a role in these decisions and finally impacts party responsiveness. We expect that more salient issues will be presented via the parliament, where the news coverage and the debate are publicized more heavily. This mobilizes public opinion and thereby constrains governments. When public opinion is less salient, issues will be legislated by Law Decree so that governments are more able to shape policies according to their liking. Looking at the Portuguese case, we shed light onto the mechanisms that direct the dynamic relationship between government preferences and voters’ preferences.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0078	514	Do parties respond to public opinion polls or past election results?	This article sets out to analyze whether political parties adjust their policy positions in response to public opinion polls. While research agrees that political parties respond to preference changes in the electorate, it usually considers past election results as the decisive yardstick by which political parties' strategic calculi are guided. In this regard, previous work has shown that parties react to their electoral performance in previous elections and to vote gains and losses of competing parties. These models thus assume that election results - often more than three years before the election campaign - are decisive in explaining the strategic behavior of political parties.Surprisingly, we know less about whether political parties respond to short(er)-term trends in public opinion. Being confronted with clear messages concerning voters’ preference structures, as shown by public opinion polls, I argue that political parties should be responsive to public opinion polls to maximize their vote share. Linking monthly data on citizens' vote preferences and data on parties’ policy positions, this article investigates whether and under which circumstances political parties respond to polling results rather than past election results. Covering a large number of European democracies since the 1950s, the resulting findings will have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of party competition and elite responsiveness.

2021	0062	142	Can diplomacy affect international trade?: Evidence from US ambassadorial vacancies	As official representatives of governments, ambassadors are charged with prevent-ing conflict and fostering cooperation. They are also empowered to promote the se-curity and economic interests of their home states, including by increasing exportsand facilitating cooperative trade outcomes. As such, during ambassadorial vacan-cies, diplomatic influence – and the associated commercial cooperation – is likely towane. We evaluate this theory by tracing the impact of US ambassadorial vacancieson bilateral international trade. Leveraging high-frequency and plausibly exogenousvariation in vacancies associated with the timing of US Presidential inaugurations, weshow that periods of US ambassadorial vacancies reduce US exports, but do not affectUS imports. These findings are driven by the vacancies of career diplomats, and aremagnified in poorer countries, where the lower quality of institutions and regulationsmake the information exchange and commitment mechanisms that diplomats provideeven more vital. One first contribution to the existing research comes from using fine-grained monthly-level and product-level data (whereas previous research has used onlyaggregated annual flows). Our second contribution is that we test the specific causalmechanisms through which diplomats influence trade flows. Our findings demonstratethe conditions under which and channels through which diplomacy can affect bilat-eral trade flows, adding to the burgeoning literature on the role of ambassadors inpromoting commercial cooperation.

2021	0095	212	Transplanting the transatlantic: United States and Europe in the Indo-Pacific	The United States and Europe powers are increasingly converging in their diagnosis of the security challenges that emanate from the Indo-Pacific. Both sides of the Atlantic now deem China as a strategic rival and point to the need to respond to the negative consequences of its assertion of power in the region. This primarily reflects a significant change in European strategic thinking. This paper explains the domestic drivers behind the changing strategic assessments in major European powers such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom as it reviews their key strategic policy documents. It then assesses the capabilities of the said states in order to ascertain the extent to which cooperation with the United States in the Indo-Pacific is possible by considering the prospects of bilateral and minilateral cooperation with the US, as well as in the context of US-EU relations and within the NATO alliance. The paper argues that in the near to medium term, there is plenty of scope for functional cooperation on the development of regional infrastructure, as well as a stepped-up involvement in the relevant diplomatic frameworks and fora. At the same time, while military cooperation is a policy area that has traditionally seen deepest integration between the two sides of the Atlantic, it is going to be more challenging in the context of the Indo-Pacific given the myriad of domestic constraints on the European side in particular.

2021	0107	267	EU and Russian regulatory power: Prescribing norms and rules in food safety and transport regimes	Meso-level conceptualizations of EU and Russian influence in their shared neighbourhood have been developed within their respective research fields. Focusing on economic, cultural, normative, and military influence they overemphasize the difference of these two actors. This has led to a dichotomous view of what kind of actors the EU and Russia are and how they exert influence over neighbouring countries. This paper conceptualizes the two actors as regional hegemons developing an ideal-typical mechanism of hegemonic power through the prescription of norms and rules. With the aim of understanding uses of prescription by the EU and Russia, uses of this mechanism in international food safety and transport regimes with one EU associated country (Moldova) and one Eurasian Economic Union member state (Armenia) are compared. The comparison shows the similarities and differences of EU and Russian regulatory power in the shared neighbourhood. On the on hand, both regional powers use this mechanism in their competition for hegemonic power in the region. On the other, EU food safety and transport regimes are more stringent with higher standards incurring higher costs on Moldovan actors that comply with them. Unified EAEU sectoral regimes are still in the making and not as far reaching as the EU ones and thus less constraining for Armenian actors. However, the analysis also shows that the differences in EU and EAEU food safety and transport regimes are not irreconcilable and thus the competition between two regional hegemons in their shared neighbourhood does not result in competing sectoral regimes.

2021	0112	633	The comparative legitimacy of arms exports -- A survey experiment in Germany and France	Despite significant politicization and heated public debates in some major exporting countries, we lack systematic research on mass public preferences on arms trade. Combining political economy models of weapon export decisions with the literatures on trade preferences and foreign policy attitudes, we propose that preferences of citizens over arms trade policy depend on economic incentives, security risk perceptions and moral considerations. Foreign policy attitudes should structure, which of these effects have most weight in the calculus of respondents. We also test for the existence of trade-offs between moral and economic considerations of arms deals, and explore the economic threshold at which arms deals become acceptable, and the moral threshold at which they become unacceptable from the perspective of the mass public. In order to derive the often implicit weighting of different issue dimensionsIn order to derive the often implicit weighting between these different features, we draw on a population-representative survey with embedded conjoint and vignette experiments (N = approx. 6600), fielded in December 2020 in Germany and France, two of the global top-5 exporting countries of major arms. Our research contributes to understanding citizen preference formation in foreign policy in general, focusing on the role of moral vs. economic reasoning therein, as well as understanding citizen preferences in an important but understudied policy field, where citizens likely hold strong opinions, although decision making is oftentimes removed from their eyes.

2021	0096	335	Same same but different? The Context Dependency of Party Perception	In order to make an informed decision, it is important for voters to know what positions political parties adopt. Political parties use a wide range of channels to communicate their positions to potential voters such as manifestos, speeches or social media. However, how these statements are perceived by the voter in terms of ideological position and credibility is not always clear. I argue that voters perceive party statements with regard to these quantities of interest differently depending on their own ideological position. This relationship is, however, mediated by the institutional context in which the statement was made and the voter’s political interest and trust. Thus, this study combines in-group or out-group perception research with literature on the influence of institutional context on the credibility of statements. Using a survey experiment in Germany, I examine in a vignette design the extent to which the perception of party statements changes when the respective party and context are known or unknown. I analyze the extent to which the evaluation of the respective statements (perception of position and trust) depends on the participant’s political positions in relation to the party and in what context (e.g. speech in parliament or extract from party manifesto) the statement was said. The survey also offers the opportunity to control not only for the respective party preference of the participants, but also for relevant demographic data, political interest and trust in institutions. The results of this study have important implications for the effects of party communication and voter perception.	Political Communications
2021	0079	343	Valence or Position? Both! A Unified Conception of Party Competition and Its Implications for the Reconstruction of Parties' Political Profiles	There are two distinct conceptions about how parties use political topics to appeal to voters. According to the first conception political topics that parties refer to in their manifestos are essentially controversial. In one variant of this conception parties make either positive or negative references to these topics and their respective position is expressed by the balance of positive and negative positions. In a different variant of the conception the controversial nature of topics becomes manifest by parties’ divergent selective emphasis of them. In the second conception parties avoid taking stances on controversial topics. Instead parties mostly refer to non-controversial political aims or 'valence issues' and selectively emphasize those of which they have gained 'issue ownership'. I argue that neither of these conceptions is exclusively valid and propose a synthesizing conception. I construct a model that formalizes this conceptual synthesis and develop a method of reconstructing parties' political profiles based on this model from manifesto data.

In a recent paper, Fernandez-Vazquez and Somer-Topcu (2019) showed that voters more accurately perceive party campaign positions following a leadership change. Yet, not all leadership changes are the same. We argue that voters expect policy change following a leadership change and modify their perceptions of party positions particularly if the new leader is from a different generation than the previous leader, of another gender, or if elected following a competitive leadership election. Using original leadership data and the CSES survey data from 11 advanced democracies, we test how voters react to different leadership changes.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0097	475	Autocratic Economic Benefits and Post-Transitional Extremism	Can economic redistribution policies in autocratic regimes shape post-transitional extremism aligned with the past? This paper shows that the exposure to autocratic redistribution programmes and their subsequent loss after transitions to democracy increases the likelihood of voting for extremist-parties aligned with the former regime. Popular support has been shown to be a crucial element for the long-term stability of undemocratic regimes, particularly, when it comes to tackling threats coming from the population. Existing studies have mostly focused on the importance of ideology in creating latent support towards dictatorships and shaping autocratic legacies. In addition to ideology, and adopting a rational-choice logic, I argue that the top-down provision of economic benefits by autocratic elites creates a relationship of self-interested dependence with the population that does not merely disappear with the fall of the regime. Using original data from Western European dictatorships — namely, data on the Nazi Welfare Programs —, I empirically show that after transitions to democracy, if the benefits provided during the former regime are jeopardised in the new democratic context, this will trigger the vote for extremist parties aligned with the former regime. Individuals that were more exposed to autocratic redistribution programs will tend to vote for extremist parties aligned with the former regime increases whenever: (i) those economic benefits are lost after transitions to democracy; (ii) and there are high levels of dissatisfaction with democracy.

2021	0080	585	The Incursion of Leviathan: Wartime Territorial Control and Post-Conflict State Capacity, Evidence from Peru	How do civil wars affect state-building decisions in the aftermath of conflict? Despite a wide literature has analyzed the impact of interstate conflict on state capacity (Tilly 1992), few studies have focused on how civil wars influence state-building measures. This paper argues that, in the post-conflict period, the state focuses its state capacity efforts to areas in which state power has eroded during wartime, with the goal of avoiding future insurgent threats. Using the Peruvian civil war (1980-1992) as the main case of study, I test whether districts that were either contested or controlled by Sendero Luminoso received higher levels of state bureaucrats and welfare expenditures than those controlled by incumbents. For this, I rely on spatial models estimators employing data for the period 1981-2007. Results support the expectations. Contested and insurgent controlled districts are targeted with the deployment of state bureaucrats and security forces after the end of the conflict, while only rebel held territories improve their level of public goods and services provision. Results are complemented with anecdotal qualitative evidence and remain robust across several robustness checks. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the inter-relation between state capacity and civil war dynamics, showing how the end of internal armed conflicts can bring improved levels of state capacity to wartime areas.

2021	0113	291	Legislative malapportionment and democratic transitions	Legislative malapportionment is one of the main determinants of the partisan effects of electoral systems in democratic countries. Previous research has focused on determining the effects of malapportionment on elections results, in particular the overrepresentation of right-wing parties. By contrast, little effort has been devoted to the causes of malapportionment. Using an original dataset on legislative malapportionment in all countries of the world after 1945, we map the conditions under which malapportionment emerges in new democracies as a result of the strategic decisions of ruling elites. Two hypotheses on the determinants of legislative malapportionment in current democracies are explored. On the one hand, we expect malapportionment to be lower in case of a previous left-wing dictatorship. On the other hand, we expect malapportionment to be higher in case of top-down democratic transitions. In the final part of the paper, the existence of potential interactive effects between these two hypotheses is examined.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0108	106	Industrialization and Democracy	Existing work on the modernization theory has focused on the effect of GDP per capita on democracy. This implicitly assumes that a 1% increase in average per capita income from agricultural production by big landowners, resource extraction, tax evasion, or tourism, is equally likely to lead to democracy as a 1% increase in income from manufacturing or modern services. I question this assumption and argue that it is primarily industrialization, and not economic growth in general, that induces democracy. In line with this hypothesis I find that industrialization is strongly correlated with democracy across 141 countries over 170 years (1845-2015), and that all existing challenges to modernization theory disappear when one focuses on industrialization, rather than GDP per capita -- e.g., the effect is robust to country and time fixed effects, occurs on both transitions and consolidations, and is present in all time periods. Two novel instruments suggest that the effect is causal.	Comparative Politics
2021	0064	83	Stuck in the “Grey Zone”: An fsQCA of Constrained Transition States	The dominant transition discourse explaining democratic and authoritarian post-communist transition outcomes in terms of national institutional differences has neglected the large number of semi-democracies, which vary in institutional development. This study investigates lower-middle to middle-income semi-democracy as a distinct but under-researched outcome among a significant group of transition states, including Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Albania, and Serbia. The histories of conflict in this group suggest realist theory may offer new insights over the institutional approach. To test this hypothesis, the study uses a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis design incorporating institutional development indices, historical institutional legacies, and energy exports, along with unresolved conflict, trade dependency on regional powers, and popular overthrows of government. It finds that cases fit three conjunctions of conditions: lack of institutional development, unresolved conflict and trade dependency on a regional power (Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova), lack of institutional development and popular overthrow of government (Albania, Kyrgyzstan), and institutional development, unresolved conflict and popular overthrow of government (Georgia, Armenia, Serbia), with Ukraine showing all three patterns. Overall, results suggest that realist conditions have constrained transition processes in the semi-democratic group and produced different outcomes than institutional conditions alone would predict.

2021	0065	199	Inclusion, recognition, and inter-group comparisons: The effects of power-sharing institutions on grievances	Extant evidence suggests that sharing power in government with minorities reduces their participation in conflict by alleviating their grievances. Yet, it remains unclear in what form and to what degree power-sharing should be institutionalized in places which lack inclusive norms in the first place. Moreover, direct attitudinal evidence for the grievance mechanism remains rare. In this article, I address these gaps. First, I argue that constitutionally-enshrined power-sharing which explicitly recognizes minorities is most likely to reassure them, prevent their perception of injustice, and alleviate their grievances. Second, I argue that minorities assess their status with respect to specific reference categories, rather than 'in a vacuum'. Hence, a lower degree of power-sharing than their peers in the same country, region, and transnational kin should increase their grievances, irrespective of its absolute level. I test my expectations in a series of hierarchical multi-level models. These make use of the most extensive combination of mass survey data used in the study of inclusive institutions and attitudes so far. By highlighting the importance of institutional design and inter-group comparisons, my results have significant implications for policy in multi-ethnic societies and for the scholarly literature on accommodation and grievances more generally.

2021	0098	389	State Dissolution and Societal Breakdown: Exploring Onset and Violence in Civil War	How do societies break down into violence? While the question of why civil wars start has received considerable attention, the question of how they start has been largely ignored. How does violence spread directly following onset? Building from a novel typology of onset, this article argues that while in some civil wars, violence at onset is geographically concentrated, in other conflicts, it spreads quickly across the territory. This is due to baseline differentials in state capacity: violence spreads faster when the state collapses at onset, typically following incomplete past conflict resolution. Using geocoded data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (GED), I compare the spread of violence following onset across civil wars. I find that onset violence is especially likely to be geographically scattered when civil war follows state dissolution, taking the form of widespread communal violence. Only in civil wars that start as a peripheral challenge does violence tend to be concentrated. These findings challenge the widely held assumption that all conflicts necessarily entail a common process of onset and escalation of violence, by providing evidence that civil wars in fact vary in patterned ways. This in turn as far-reaching consequences for research on the causes and dynamics of civil war.	Comparative Politics
2021	0081	350	Civil Society Organizations and Protests' Escalation to Civil War in Non-Democracies	Civil society organizations (CSOs) facilitate mobilization for nonviolent protests, yet protests sometimes go on a very violent trajectory, precipitating the onset of civil war. This paper studies the effect of CSOs on protests' escalation to civil war. It argues that while CSOs can facilitate the occurrence of protests, CSOs can have a mediating role in preventing the onset of civil war once protests take place. The facilitating and mediating role of CSOs is conditional on their capacity, which is a function of two dimensions: participation and autonomy from the state. Importantly, CSOs cannot substitute facilitation for mediation before protests occur as the mediating role works only if conflict is not latent. I test the proposition that higher capacity CSOs facilitate the occurrence of protests, but once protests take place, higher capacity CSOs mediate conflict, thereby decreasing the probability of civil war onset as a protests' trajectory. The findings from an empirical investigation with global panel data from 1990 to 2018 show support for this proposition.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0109	617	Occurrence of Extremist Religious Ideologies in Civil War	Civil wars have been studied from various angles, discussing why they occur, when they are particularly violent and when they end. To this end, group interests and inequalities in economic, political or social dimensions have been analysed. However, research has often overlooked a central defining component of rebel organisations, and therefore civil war: ideology. This is partly due to difficulties in observing and operationalising ideology. Nevertheless, all rebel groups have one by which they frame their cause, and which may determine their organisational structure, as well as patterns of recruitment and violence. Arguably, not all rebel organisations are extremist, although they violently oppose a government. Looking at recent wars, extremism—especially religious extremism—seems to increase. The entailing question, in which contexts wars are justified with (extremist) religious ideologies, has not yet been answered satisfyingly. What is being neglected in existing attempts is a social-psychological view: while psychological explanations of radicalisation are manifold, they are rarely being considered as explanations for group- and national-level developments. Therefore, modeling data on religious ideologies in conflict (RELAC), I argue that while significance loss increases the likelihood of any type of rebel organisation grouping, societies with recent experiences of mortality salience are particularly receptive to extremist religious ideologies.

2021	0082	136	Vox Populi, Vox Dei: Thermostatic Support for Direct Democracy	European democracies are experiencing declining levels of popular support for institutions and processes of representative democracy, while support for the participatory - and populist - model of democracy is on the rise. The academic debate on populism and direct democracy mainly revolves around policy output failures: e.g. the role of the socio-cultural `left-behind' vs. the economic disaffected. More recently, researchers have turned to political representation, and therefore to `input' failures in representative democracies. Is support for direct democracy a thermostatic response to a) failures to represent the vox populi; b) technocratic overreach? And does this vary by policy issue salience/politicization? We use the European Election Study 2019 to compare the effects of various explanatory models in the literature on democratic attitudes and support, and compare them to indirect measures of political dissatisfaction, pillars of our argument. We then run a large survey experiment via YouGov, where we refine the measurement of political dissatisfaction by using the sociotropic ideological congruence construct, and where we directly test the thermostatic explanation of declining support for liberal representative democracy by experimentally exposing respondents to a technocratic discourse. We find that support for popular decision-making is a thermostatic reaction to representation failures and technocratic discourse, but only in the case of salient and `easy' policy issues.

2021	0099	629	Voting against your constituency? Legitimacy sources of representatives with competing principals	Elected representatives often face tensions between competing principals, such as their constituents and the political party they belong to. While such cases are well discussed in theory, less attention has been put to empirically scrutinizing them. If tension arises between the party interests and those of the constituents, what explains the behavior of these agents-of-two-principles? The present study exploits the Brexit vote – which allowed MPs to be directly informed about their constituency’s preferences on a specific policy issue ex-ante, before they take action – to explore this question. Empirically, we employ regression analysis to predict the votes on Theresa May’s Brexit Deal as a function of MP’s partisanship and the vote of their constituency. We show that while for Labor MPs, the more their constituency voted Leave the greater chance they had to support May’s Deal (and vote against their party line), for Conservatives the opposite was the case – the more their constituency voted Leave the less chance they had to support the Deal. We proceed to identify cross-pressured MPs and compare their floor speeches – focusing on MPs sources of legitimacy for action – with those who were not cross-pressured. Our preliminary findings show considerable differences between these two groups of representatives, in the degree to which they refer to the good of the whole citizenry, their constituency and party when justifying their actions. Our findings shed light on the representational dilemma and its consequences, which are inherently linked to representative democracy and its pitfalls.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0066	14	Strategy, Ideology, and Opportunity: When Political Parties Support Direct Democracy	During every crisis of representative democracy there is a surge of demands for more direct forms of participation. Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the 5 Star Movement in current-day Italy — discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actor in the formulation of these demands? We ask why political parties call and/or support direct democracy. We provide three major motivations: strategy, ideology, and opportunity. Based on Party Manifesto Data and additional newly collected data we show how strategic motivations seem to account for most changes in party positions towards direct democracy. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins as well as it helps to better understand whether direct democracy is endogenous with certain outcomes or not.	Comparative Politics
2021	0169	478	Populist Right Success and Mainstream Party Adaptation: The Case of Free Trade	Are populist right parties making mainstream parties more economically protectionist? From West to East, European parties of the populist right are experiencing increasing electoral success by running on platforms stressing cultural an economic protectionism. While previous studies have found a causal link between populist right success and mainstream parties’ shifts on immigration and multiculturalism, an unexplored topic is the degree to which populist right success is causing mainstream parties to become more lukewarm in their support for trade liberalization and economic globalization. By imbuing the issue of trade with the symbolic power of nationalism, populist right parties can transform trade into an “easy” issue for voters, causing mainstream parties to avoid the politicization of trade by deemphasizing it from their campaign statements. In this paper, I test this deemphasis hypothesis by conducting a quantitative text analysis of mainstream parties' campaign rhetoric from 1990 to 2020, covering 21 European democracies.

2021	0133	215	Emerging divisions on trade in post-Brexit UK	With Brexit, the United Kingdom (UK) left the European Union’s (EU) delegated trade model and is able to independently set up its own free trade agreements (FTAs). This is considered to be one of the major advantages of exiting the EU and its Customs Union. FTAs are a priority of the UK government’s economic approach post-Brexit linked to prosperity and well-being. Yet trade has distributional consequences. Its benefits are dispersed while its costs are concentrated. Against this background, this paper examines how individuals form preferences on FTAs. Starting from the premise that signing FTAs is a new and hard political issue, i.e. high complex with undefined outcomes, we posit that to form their preferences individuals employ heuristics related to their subjective perception of whether the country will have the upper hand in the negotiations. The effect of heuristics is amplified through Brexit-related affective polarization. We test our hypotheses, using original observational and experimental data from a survey representative of the UK population, carried out by YouGov in July 2019, which confirm our expectations. Our findings have implications for the study of the role of heuristics in opinion formation on highly complex issues.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0151	454	Comparing Mobilization and Access: USMCA Lobbying in the U.S. and Canada	The political economy of U.S. lobbying centers around the prevalence of large corporations’ individually targeting of legislators. Does this extend to a similar economy with similar lobbying rules, or is this predominance of corporate lobbying particular to the U.S.? We examine this question for the first time by comparing firm and association lobbying in the U.S. and Canada regarding the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). We argue that the concentration of policy leverage on the executive rather than the legislative branch, and tighter constraints on corporate donations compared to the US, would produce distinctive patterns of lobbying in Canada. Corroborating this idea, we find notable differences in the lobbying patterns across the border. Within the same industries, access to the executive is prioritized in Canada and trade associations play a relatively larger role. The findings broaden our understanding of the role of political institutions for producer mobilization in the two countries, and demonstrate the relative importance of legislators and corporations as unique features of the American political system.

Especially in the context of the trade war between the U.S. and China, the bilateral trade imbalance has been vociferously problematised. An important, however understudied, question arises: How do citizens of the mass public evaluate their country’s trade balance? For many contemporary economists, the vilification of trade balances is puzzling. The conventional wisdom therefore cannot explain the salience of trade imbalances. Harking back at mercantilist propositions, current events suggest that some citizens care about deficits and with what country the imbalance is. I seek to gain a better understanding of such dynamics by conducting representative survey experiments in the P.R. of China and the U.S. (n=4000). I present citizens with real information about their country’s overall trade balance as well as with respect to specific countries. Preliminary evidence from pilot studies support mercantilist expectations as citizens from both countries view trade deficits more negatively than surpluses. In addition, particularly deficits with political competitors are rejected. My findings thus highlight why the trade imbalance is a key point of contention in U.S.-Sino relations and that aspects of mercantilist ideas prevail after more than half a millennium.

2021	0134	462	Rural isolation and political dissatisfaction in Italy	It is widely held view that left-behind rural areas' resentment against urban political elites underlies the recent success of populist parties. But the sharp distinction drawn between rural and urban areas obfuscates competing cleavages and hides significant differences existing among rural areas. By focussing on Italy and relying on an integrative multi-method design, we unpack the origins of political dissatisfaction in more or less isolated rural areas. First, we analyze electoral data to show that turnout decreases as rural areas are more isolated from urban centers and support anti-establishment parties increases with isolation. Second, we analyze administrative data to show that more isolated rural areas differ significantly from less isolated ones based on several dimensions, including access to public services, shops, and cultural activities; integration in the labor market; exposure to environmental risks; and age and ethnic composition. Third, we exploit a 2010 Italian reform that forced small municipalities into inter-municipal unions to examine the causal effect of reducing access to public services on political dissatisfaction. Fourth, we conduct interview-based case studies to uncover why some municipalities complied with the obligation to enter an inter-municipal union while others decided to oppose it. Fifth, we conduct a survey experiment to address the individual level mechanisms linking forced inter-municipal union and political dissatisfaction. Our results suggest that in order to the spatial gradient of political dissatisfaction, researchers should go beyond the classic dichotomic analysis of urban-rural divides and look at more fine-grained measures of isolation.

2021	0115	589	From Feudalism to Populism: Evidence from Poland	What explains the support for populism? During early industrialization, the path of industrialization, as reflected in advances in transportation technology, has determined the spatial pattern of urbanization which through path dependence persistently shapes contemporary economic fortunes. We argue that geographies where urbanization was concentrated in fewer and relatively more populous urban centers will be conducive to a high level of inequality in access to economic opportunities, and that resentment over the resulting relative deprivation generates demand for populism. We test our theory empirically by looking at the case of Poland, and using an original dataset find evidence that differences in the extent of the construction of railways between and within Austrian, Russian and German empires pursued in what is now Poland have persistently shaped the distribution of economic fortunes in space and explain the spatial distribution of support for the populist Law and Justice.

2021	0152	325	Local Conditions and Their Interactions with Individual-Level Determinants of Populist Radical Right Voting in Germany	In recent years, Germany experienced a considerable increase in populist radical right (PRR) voting. However, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) election results vary considerably between different German regions. Apart from the East/West German special case, the common explanations for the geographical clustering of the populist radical right (PRR) vote are mostly regional deprivation and/or the rural-urban divide. Germany represents an interesting case in this respect, since neither are deprived regions necessarily rural regions (as it is the case in many other countries) nor are all AfD strongholds in deprived regions – it is rather the other way round: the AfD does well in comparatively wealthy regions such as for instance Southern Germany or Saxony. But why do AfD election results vary so much by region? While scholars already have an idea about macro- and micro-level factors for PRR voting, the mechanisms linking both together are widely unknown. Two possible mechanisms are especially focused upon: regional inequality and changes of the local conditions over time. The paper therefore aims to explain the link between local context and individual vote choice for the AfD. It combines individual-level data and contextual-level data on neighbourhood- and county-level to account for the uncertainty about the (ir-)relevance of different geographical levels. Multi-level regression models containing cross-level interactions are conducted to answer the research question. By using unique geo-referenced small-scale data, the paper seeks to fill the research gap regarding mechanisms that link contextual effects to the individual level to better understand regional patterns in AfD voting.

2021	0135	131	Legislators’ Sentiment Analysis Supervised by Legislators	The sentiment expressed in legislator’s speech in a chamber is informative (compared to roll call), in particular in a legislature with partisan discipline, but extracting legislators’ sentiment from their speech is time and resource consuming. For instance, studies may develop a dictionary that lists positive and negative sentiment words. For another, supervised machine learning may help, but requires data labeled by human coders. In both cases, constructing such dictionaries or labeled data is labor-intensive and could be subjective. To address this challenge, we propose a research design to exploit closing debates on a bill, where legislators label their speech by stating their position on a bill. We claim that with this set of debates as training data, analysts can accurately detect sentiment in speech through various classification methods. Furthermore, using paired debates on a bill from different positions, analysts can minimize the influence of topic-specific words irrelevant to the sentiment. We apply our method to the corpora of all speeches in the House of Representatives of Japan, 1955-2014. After constructing a final debate corpus, we train multiple supervised models and use them to scale other speeches. We show that the sentiments of multiple actors’ (e.g. cabinet ministers, government party members, and opposition party members) speeches line up in an expected order over time. Furthermore, we show that government backbenchers and opposition members get more polarized as the next election is approaching, although both sides come together towards the end of a legislative session.

A Text Reuse Analysis of Which Amendments Make it into Law	In parliamentary systems, Governments play a major legislative role: they draft and propose legislation, and build the necessary coalition to ensure that a given bill will become law. Other parliamentary groups are often seen as residual, having very little influence on the policy making process. However, some parliamentary groups might be more effective than others at inserting their policy proposals into enacted legislation. Due to data and methodological limitations, large-N and systematic studies of the conditions under which parliamentary groups are successful at influencing legislation are extremely rare, leaving crucial questions about who and why has power at influencing legislation unanswered. To what extent do parliaments reverse executive proposals? What parliamentary groups are more efficient in performing this task? In order to answer these questions, first, we compare executive bills proposals as they enter the legislative process with the final text of laws using text reuse methods. Next, we identify the parliamentary group responsible for the different amendments and calculate the amendments’ efficiency rate for each group. The theoretical framework explores causality taking into consideration the macro level (such as the characteristics of bills, the type of government or the electoral cycle), but also the micro level (parliamentary groups’ resources, including past parliamentary experience, specialization and expertise, and ideological distance from the incumbent). The analysis relies on a new database containing all the executive bills introduced into the Spanish Parliament from 1996 to present.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0170	418	Cross-lingual supervised classification of political texts	Large portions of political text collections are multilingual and principally invite comparative quantitative analysis. However, established methods for cross-lingual text analysis require reliance on linguistically qualified human coders, human translators, or reliable machine translation and thus tend to thwart comparative research. In this paper, I propose an alternative method that relies on multilingual text embedding: Texts written in different languages are embedded in a joint semantic space using a publicly available multilingual language model. The resulting text embeddings are then used as inputs to train a supervised machine learning classifier. To validate the proposed approach, I conduct a series of text classification experiments on three different political text corpora. These experiments show that classifiers trained on multilingual text embeddings pass three important tests: They classify held-out texts as accurately as comparable classifiers trained on monolingual or translated texts. They perform by and large consistently across languages. And they classify texts written in languages that were not present among the training data with little to no loss in predictive performance. Viewed together, these results present supervised classification from multilingual text embeddings as a reliable, replicable, and cost-efficient approach to multilingual text classification. This study thus contributes to an emerging methodological literature on multilingual quantitative text analysis in political science.	Political Methodology
2021	0153	180	Measuring Parties' Evolving Issue Agendas	Political parties emphasis different issues in their public communication efforts to address the topics of the day and to strengthen their policy profiles. In this article, we develop a dynamic supervised machine learning model to measure parties' evolving issue agendas from press releases. The model combines a language model for the classification of texts into pre-specified issue categories and a dynamic hierarchical model for the evolution of each parties' emphasis of these issue-categories in published press-releases. We estimate the model jointly on the labelled and unlabeled press-release data to evaluate the overall issue agendas. A simulation study shows that this model outperforms existing approaches to estimate category prevalence in text corpora when issue agendas evolve smoothly over time. An application to press releases of German and Austrian parties from 2012-2018 illustrates the usefulnesses of our approach in studying dynamic party competition, communication and behaviour.

However, merging data sets when the number of variables used for record linkage is restricted remains challenging. In this paper I consider the case when the information is limited to a single multi-token text string. This situation often occurs when researchers work with organization names, user accounts or any other short labels. Using Lobbying Disclosure Act data I illustrate substantive implications that the choice of record linkage approach can have in empirical research. I review the existing approaches and consider three types of noise that can typically be encountered in this scenario: character-level, word-level or a combination of both. Furthermore, I conduct a simulation study showing the sensitivity of the existing approaches to the presence of errors occurring at different levels. The results suggest that the optimal choice of a record linkage approach depends on contextual knowledge about the most likely type of noise, as well as stress the need to conduct sensitivity analysis using different record linkage approaches.

While scholars identified the economic causes of populism in trade, unemployment, or migration, the evidence on the role of banks is scant. In this paper we aim to fill this gap. We investigate whether lending cuts by banks increase the electoral support for populist parties. To this end, we exploit the impact of an exogenous lending cut by a large German bank in 2007-08 on the voting behaviour of individuals set in counties exposed to the cut. We combine this data with SOEP data on individual voting intentions for populist parties. Based on this strategy, our paper shows new empirical evidence on the causal effect of banking crises on individuals’ political attitudes.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration

An Experimental Analysis	It is often taken for granted that social identity and the relative strength of group identities matter for how public resources are allocated. We present an experiment that enables us to identify the causal effects of social identity and the relative strength of group identities over the allocation of a windfall profit. Specifically, we utilize a simplified version of the Baron-Ferejohn (henceforth BF) Model to derive a prediction on how rational agents allocate such a windfall profit. In the experiment, subjects are placed into groups of five and bargain over the allocation of a windfall profit using the BF mechanism. According to the minimal group paradigm, subjects’ social identity was induced by conducting a tournament version of the Klee-Kandinsky task before the bargaining stage. Here we distinguish three treatment conditions, namely bargaining in homogenous groups (only Klees’, only Kandinskys’), in heterogeneous groups (3 Klees’ vs. 2 Kandinskys’ and vice versa), and bargaining in a control group in which subjects are not informed about their Klee-Kandinsky identity. Our experimental results provide strong evidence on the ambiguous effect of social identity. While homogenous groups agree on a fairer allocation, there is robust evidence for in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination, compared to the control treatment. Contrary to previous research studying social identity and allocation preferences, this study shows that a collective decision-making mechanism that allows targeting allocation decisions by social groups (here BF) unleashes both the positive and negative social identity consequences for social welfare.

2021	0154	251	Bureaucrats, Politicians, and the Strategic Use of Information	The political control of the bureaucracy remains a classical topic in political science. However, little is known about the reverse of this relationship: bureaucracies influencing politicians. I conceptualise bureaucratic influence on legislators as the extent to which legislators use the information produced by agencies in the legislative process. Building on cheap talk models of strategic communication, I argue that legislators will make greater use of bureaucratic information when ideologically close to agencies. Agency independence, operating as a credibility-enhancing mechanism, can nonetheless mitigate the effect of ideological distance. I introduce a new measurement strategy to estimate legislators’ use of bureaucratic information which employs natural language processing techniques and syntactic parsing. I apply this method to a corpus of 6.8 million speeches given by US congresspersons in forty years of floor and committee speeches. A series of two-way fixed effects specifications reveal that, on average, the use of bureaucratic information decreases with legislator-agency ideological distance, but the effect is weaker for more independent agencies.

2021	0117	96	Decision Analysis – The Prophet Muhammad: A Multi-Method Approach	Most qualitative research studies examine leaders' decision-making process (DMP) patterns by using a single methodological approach. Even studies that use triangulation of approaches don't use more than one qualitative-analytical method. Although this kind of research suggests an in-depth examination of the DMP, it is incomplete. This is due to a relatively narrow point of view, i.e. a single qualitative-analytical methodology. In order to get a broader, yet an in-depth examination of leaders' DMP, this paper suggests using a combination of three qualitative-analytical methodologies, each contributing a different perspective on the DMP. First, the study will apply Applied Decision Analysis (ADA), to identify the leader's decision rule. Thereafter, we shall use Non-Cooperative Game Theory and in particular - Extensive Form, to examine how the leader's decisions are made when they take into account other players under conditions of uncertainty. Finally, the study will address cognitive psychology by using Prospect Theory, for understanding leader's degree of risk-taking or risk aversion, depending on their own framing. The case study of this paper will be the key decisions related to war and peace of the founder of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad. The results of the research suggest that the Prophet Muhammad follows the Rational Choice Rule; Furthermore, He tried to predict the behavior of his adversary to maximize his gains; and his decision-making process is characterized by the principle of Loss Aversion.

2021	0171	93	Oversight, Inequality, and Capacity	Bureaucratic oversight frequently relies upon information provided by citizens complaints. I argue that the use of complaints in oversight generates variation in a state's capacity to implement public policies and shapes 'who gets what'' from the state. I study the distributional consequences of oversight institution by developing a formal model of service provision. Specifically, I consider a politician's choice to use (or ignore) information generated by complaints when monitoring a bureaucrat. Complaints generate information that direct a politicians' remediation of bureaucratic decisions and may increase bureaucratic effort. However, when costs of complaint vary across the population, use of this information generates inequality in the distribution of service outputs, improving access of citizens that can complain while reducing access of citizens that cannot. Further, relying on citizen information can build or erode a state's capacity for policy implementation, depending on the distribution of these costs across the population. This paper introduces citizen complaint systems as an institution that shapes both policy implementation capacity and distributional outcomes in comparative perspective.

2021	0118	643	Does Source Credibility Moderate Persuasion? New Evidence from a Longitudinal Experiment	Scholars have documented long-term declines in mainstream media trust in the United States and elsewhere, a trend that raises concerns about the ability of citizens to hold their governments to account amid increasing polarization. Underlying these concerns are basic questions about the relationship between people's trust in news sources and the extent to which their attitudes are subject to change when they encounter new information from those sources. Early studies proposed the core insight that persuasion hinges on source credibility: how much people find information from a source to be believable. However, existing research on the topic almost universally takes source credibility as given. This is problematic because patterns of trust can be confounded in any number of ways. To overcome this problem, we create a hypothetical news outlet and manipulate participants' perceived credibility in this source. We then randomly assign subjects to read op-eds on topics attributed to the source's editorial board. Our three-wave design allows us to test the persistence of both our credibility manipulation and the persuasive effect of exposure to information from our news source. In doing so, we provide for the first time a comprehensive test of classical expectations that information from trusted intermediaries is more persuasive. Promisingly, our credibility treatments produce lasting effects on trust in our mock news source. We find some evidence that greater source credibility boosts the persuasiveness of arguments about a relatively unpoliticized topic, though this appears not to be the case for two issues that more clearly divide partisans.

2021	0137	605	The Intrusion of Value Change: Popular Media and pro-Women Attitudes in Argentina	Every so often, societies see new values enter the public domain, gain support and convert from marginal to mainstream. What accounts for such value shifts? Existing work suggests that value change happens gradually, via cohort replacement. This view comes at odds, however, with a growing realisation of a rather abrupt pattern of change, giving room within short time period to new moral paradigms. What accounts for such a quick turn in moral values? We address this question by looking at how a specific ideology, feminism, can enter the public fray. How can public perceptions about feminism, and attitudes towards women in more general, change? To answer this question we point to the role of media in successfully transmitting new value benchmarks. We make use of Intrusos, a popular entertainment show in Argentina, which dedicated an entire week to inform its audience, typically Argentinian housewives, about feminism and abortion. The focus on feminism was sudden, unexplainable to close observers and participants of the show, and eventually short-lived—it only lasted a couple of weeks before Intrusos went back into its standard content, rich with women objectification. However, as feminist activists passed through their screens, we argue that Intrusos paved the way to the destigmatization and legitimacy of Argentinian women’s movement into households otherwise difficult to reach. Using a difference-in-differences design, we look at google trends, twitter data, survey data from Latinobarometro, household data on the internet connection, and TV ratings, to assess the Intrusos effect on Argentinian's attitudes about gender roles.

2021	0172	621	Immigration media frames, national identity representations importance and its impact on outgroup prejudice and immigration policy preferences	Existing research has explored how media messages influence the salience of national identification in attitudes towards immigrants and asylum seekers as well as immigration policy preference. These studies depart from SIT and SCT to show media messages increase the salience of national identification, resulting in higher outgroup prejudice and preference for restrictive policies. However, as recent studies bring to light, national identity representations (NIRs) mediate the relationship between national identity strength and attitude outcomes. More specifically, strong national identification leads to outgroup prejudice and preference for more restrictive immigration policies when associated with more essentialist NIRs (ethnic or cultural) as opposed to a more inclusive one (civic). Yet, the role the media plays in increasing the weight people assign to different NIRs in outgroup prejudice remains unexplored. To address this gap, this study examines how identity-related frames – by highlighting immigrants’ ingroup or outgroup categorisation – affect the weight of NIRs and, thus, influence attitudes towards outgroups and immigration policy preferences. This study will conduct an online between-subject experiment embedded in a survey among a sample of German (Christian) natives. I expect to find that assimilation frames increase the weight of cultural NIRs, resulting in higher prejudice towards immigrants and a preference for more restrictive immigration policies. Conversely, I hypothesise that multicultural frames improve outgroup attitudes and immigration policy preferences by increasing the weight of civic NIR.	Political Communications
2021	0155	40	Voluntary Sacrifice of Freedom: Why Are Some Chinese Nationals Supporting Government Censorship?	While the effects of government censorship are widely explored in the literature, most works on government censorship have assumed a nature intention for citizens to seek freedom of speech in authoritarian regimes. However, citizens in authoritarian regimes may actually support government censorship due to various reasons. In this study, I explore the potential reasons of citizen's support towards government censorship in China among Chinese nationals both domestic and abroad. Also, I will investigate individual's willingness to self-censor and the types of censorship one would likely to give consent to. Adopting a mixed methodology design consisting of an online survey experiment, a cross-national online survey and a semi-structured qualitative interview, I examine the following factors of interest: (1) personal experience of government censorship, (2) personal pursuit of democracy as an ideal form of government, and (3) the political environment experienced by individuals.

2021	0173	186	Testing the Backlash Argument: Voter Responses to Pro-immigration Reforms	Do significant pro-immigration reforms--especially in the contexts where voters are anti-immigration--increase populist voting? Despite the common assumption that such reforms would lead to counter-productive voter backlash informed by the voluminous literature on immigration group threat, the extent to which immigration policy itself influences voters has been unclear. To address this question, this paper estimates the impact of immigration policy on populist voting and immigration attitudes by exploiting the timing of major changes to immigration laws in an original dataset linking the best available public opinion and policy data across the last forty years in 24 European countries. I confirm pro-immigration policies and reforms are associated with slightly higher levels of populist voting across countries. However, I also demonstrate pro-immigration (or anti-immigration) policy changes do not affect populist voting or immigration concerns within countries after accounting for time-invariant confounders. This suggests pro-immigration reforms are unlikely to backfire due to voter backlash.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0156	590	European identities and migration preferences	Identity is a central element for European integration and influences attitudes towards various policy areas, also in the case of migration. A large part of the empirical EU literature builds on a binary conceptualization of identity, which essentially distinguishes between EU citizens that have integrated some (not specified) form of a European dimension into their identity – versus those that have exclusively national or regional identities. Such a binary conception ignores the different forms European identities can take. An exclusive version of a European identity can strengthen the aversion to migration from outside the EU. On the other extreme, a European identity that expresses an inclusive view of society is associated with a more liberal approach to migration policy. Based on this premise, this paper develops a more nuanced conceptualization of European identities and relates them to preferences in migration politics. As a first empirical step, we study the link between European identities and migration policy preferences using established cross-country data. Furthermore, we use a survey experiment to analyze how stable identity influences preferences on migration. In times in which the policy answer of the EU to the challenge of migration is at the heart of a contested EU, getting a grasp of how European identities shape migration preferences is crucial.

2021	0119	587	Free Movement in the Shadow of the Referendum: The Impact of Culture, Context and Competition on People’s Immigration Preferences	Immigration in general and the free-movement of persons in particular have been prominent and at times even dominating issue within newsmedia and academic discourses for the past years. Extant literature has sought to explain variation in individuals’ opposition to immigration and has mostly focused on two main forms of natives’ threats when evaluating immigration: economic and cultural sources. The difficulty for existing studies is to disentangle the economic threat immigration poses to a certain individual from the cultural impact of immigration. In our paper, we attempt to separate the economic and the cultural impact immigrants have by making use of a specific particularity of Switzerland as a rather small landlocked country within Europe. It shares long stretches of borders with Germany, France and Italy and thus attracts an unusually high number of cross-border commuters. In contrast to labor migrants from EU/EFTA states, these individuals only come to work in Switzerland but otherwise do not partake in everyday social life within the communities. While economically these commuters pose the same threat as foreigners living in Switzerland, culturally they should not. This gives us a unique opportunity to test whether the labor market competition hypothesis prevails or whether cultural or other factors need to be figured in more closely. Evidence from a survey experiment within the Swiss context, however, indicates that cross-border commuters are viewed much less favorable than resident foreigners (even when controlling for exposure in various ways), weakening both potential explanations.

2021	0138	141	Choose Your Target Wisely: Explaining the Variation in Nationalist Appeals in Contemporary Europe	Nationalism has resurged across Europe since the 1980s, with a dramatic rise in the number of parties utilising nationalist appeals, and experiencing electoral success as a result. However, nationalism has multiple forms, and parties face strategic choices about how to combine them. Two prominent forms of nationalism are ethnoregionalism and cultural protectionism, where the latter includes anti-immigration and anti-ethnic minority appeals. Nationalist parties can combine these two forms in a variety of ways, but I argue that the European Union (EU) systematically incentivises these parties to prioritise ethnoregionalism instead of cultural protectionism. In particular, two key reforms of EU governance reforms have incentivised nationalist parties to prioritise ethnoregionalism: greater regional access to EU policy-making after the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993; and the fundamental reform of structural funding in 1988. Thus, both EU membership after 1993 and higher levels of EU funding are hypothesised to increase the relative saliency of ethnoregionalism for nationalist parties, especially in highly regionalised countries. These hypotheses are examined through a quantitative analysis of party manifestos across 33 European countries from 1980 until now. This analysis demonstrates that the interaction between EU membership and regionalisation has a significant and substantively large effect on the relative saliency of ethnoregionalism, but structural funding has no significant effect on ethnoregionalism’s relative saliency.

2021	0120	65	Bad Politicians, Good Bureaucrats: Modelling Public Sector Corruption and Bureaucratic Reliability	Most models of bureaucracy tend to assume a principal-agent model in which elected politicians delegate policy implementation to bureaucrats. It is generally theorized that shifts from the citizens’ ideal points happen at the agent (i.e. the bureaucrat) level, but recent studies in developing economies show that this might not always be the case. This paper adds an additional perspective to existing accountability models by relaxing the assumption that all principals are principled. The proposed model combines theories of executive influence and pro-social motivation into a formal mechanism that explains how the different social welfare outcomes arise from the decisions of political principals and bureaucratic agents. Defining bureaucratic reliability as the choice to improve social welfare by selecting an efficient firm in a procurement environment, I show that the nature of the principal determines the existence of a high, intermediate or low reliability equilibrium. The main findings are that the corruption of the political principals may induce a bureaucratic reliability trap, that dishonest principals are associated with fewer public-minded individuals in the bureaucracy, and that the corruption of the political regime and the level of economic development may also affect bureaucratic recruitment.

2021	0157	328	Looking the other way? Selective media exposure and the electoral punishment of corruption	Citizens are expected to punish corrupt politicians at the polls. In line with this presumption, lab and survey experiments consistently show that citizens are unlikely to vote for candidates that engage in corruption. At the same time, observational studies and field experiments frequently conclude that corrupt politicians are only mildly punished by voters. This apparent contradiction could be due to the design implemented in previous lab and survey experiments. In the real world, individuals tend to avoid and downplay information that challenges previously held beliefs, like their partisanship. An experimental design that randomly informs participants about corruption, and disregards the fact that citizens are prone to self-select information, is highly unrealistic and might lead to an overestimation of the electoral consequences of corruption. Unlike previous studies, this paper implements a Preference Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) experimental design in order to address the following question: how does information about corruption affect the likelihood of voting for corrupt politicians when accounting for information self-selection? Based on an online experiment conducted in Spain (N = 3,200), the PICA design allows us to estimate the electoral consequences of corruption accounting for the fact that citizens are able to overlook information about corruption from their preferred party, either by exposing themselves selectively to information about the good performance of their party or by avoiding information about politics altogether. The PICA design increases validity by explicitly modelling how citizens navigate information about malfeasance from their party, while retaining the internal validity of fully randomized experiments.

2021	0174	348	Mind and machine: rooting out corrupt politicians	Corruption is pervasive across the world, yet voters keep electing corrupt politicians. One common explanation in the literature is that voters elect corrupt politicians because they do not know they are corrupt. Yet, several studies that randomise the provision of information about corruption find that electoral accountability is weak at best or non-existent at worst. Despite these results, policy-makers still emphasise the importance of transparency and publicity in the fight against corruption. Rather than studying the impact of information about corruption on accountability, we contribute to this debate by taking a different approach, and explore what kind of information allows voters to identify the “bad apples”? Based on a unique dataset which allows us to identify corrupt behaviour unknown to voters, we first employ machine learning algorithms to identify politicians’ political and personal characteristics that are associated with corrupt practices. We subsequently design an experiment that randomises the provision of this information to evaluate what candidate descriptions enable voters to discriminate good from bad politicians. In other words, we explore under what informational conditions voters ultimately pick the right politician. Our study also aims to contribute to the policy push for greater information disclosure about candidates for public office, by refining exactly what within the information leads to better voter choices.

2021	0183	645	Leaders on Trial: Why do Countries Convict Heads of Government for Corruption?	Differently from prior decades when presidents, prime ministers and dictators were seldom convicted, convictions for corruption have increased substantially since the early to 2000s across the world. Corruption is now the most common reason why former leaders receive a judicial conviction, having surpassed human rights abuses and the use of political violence. I use original data on the timing and the details of all convictions received by heads of government between 1946 and 2020 to test the conditions under which these convictions are more likely to occur. I assess diffferent explanations for when countries are more likely to convict their leaders, including the the role played by democratic consolidation, executive turnover and media pluralism. I complement these analyses by testing the determinants of judicial overturns and pardons.	Comparative Politics
2021	0139	77	When Corruption Matters for Ordinary People: Anti-Corruption Appeals in Elections	Corruption is often claimed to play a central role in elections. Previous studies have tended to assume the experience and perception of corruption affects all voters equally. We highlight both key variations (in terms of how much voters care about corruption and parties’ corrupt behaviour) and the benefits of seeing the impact of corruption less in binary terms and more as a sliding scale. Drawing on specially commissioned polling data, we find the more voters care about corruption the more they vote for clean parties, that parties are tainted by their corrupt coalition partners, and that anti-corruption stances trump ideological appeals. The findings indicate the merits of using large-scale polling data to examine the motivations of voters in cases where corruption is assumed to play an important role in elections.

2021	0175	569	The effect of terrorism on government stability	While the effect of terrorism on voting behavior has been extensively studied in recent years, we still know little about how political elites react to such deleterious events. On the one hand, external threats have been said to create incentives to cooperate across party lines, which can bring 'politics-as-usual' to a standstill. On the other hand, terrorist violence can also open the door to a blame game to signal the incumbent’s inability to guarantee citizens' protection. As a result, terror attacks may have important political consequences in contexts where government stability depends on agreements between different parties. We leverage the occurrence of terror attacks perpetrated by ETA in the Basque Country in Spain and use a difference-in-difference approach to analyze the effect of terrorism on the stability of local governments and the formation of coalitions in Basque municipalities. Our results contribute to our understanding of the choices that political parties make in the aftermath of terror attacks and have profound implications for the functioning of democracies subject to violent threats.

2021	0121	440	Margin of (t)error: Predicting the onset and incidence of terrorism in civil conflicts	Terrorism occurs in around 75 per cent of civil conflicts. Previous studies have explained variation in the number of terrorist attacks by rebel group, region, and country per month, year and over longer periods of time. They identify group, country and regime characteristics that make terrorism more likely. However, these measures have not been tested for their predictive performance. This study will make two contributions to the literature on terrorism in civil conflicts: it will test the predictive power of existing indicators used in the literature, and it will not only test predictive performance regarding the incidence but also the onset of terrorism. Support vector machines with radial kernels are used in combination with interpretable machine learning techniques to illustrate findings intuitively and to go beyond standard measures of accuracy, precision and recall. Evidence from available replication data suggests that many variables identified as explanatory factors in previous studies have limited predictive power.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0140	56	Merchants of Death: Arms Imports and Terrorism	Do arms imports fuel terrorism? We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in global arms trade patterns as an instrument to provide causal evidence of a significant positive effect of arms imports on terrorist activity for 179 countries between 1992 and 2018. We also show that arms imports do not conclusively strengthen state capacity but increase corruption and political exclusion, which may explain why arms imports ultimately encourage terrorism. Finally, the adverse effect of arms imports on terrorism is strongest among countries characterized by low levels of fiscal capacity as well as high levels of political inequality and authoritarianism.

2021	0158	625	Cooperation dilemma in Counterterrorism Operations	What factors drive cooperation in the counterterrorism (CT) domain? Although in the last twenty years, many scholars have been studying terrorism and CT, such a question has remained unanswered so far. Very few attempts have been made, hence new researches are needed. The here-present paper addresses this issue, providing a twofold contribution. First, it fosters existent analyses by proposing a new theoretical framework that combines CT studies and alliances literature. Both fields have underlined different aspects, however, none of them has been able to give a satisfactory answer. By merging their most decisive insights, it is instead possible to reach a more complete and exhaustive response. This explanation considers citizens’ role, states’ domestic structures, alongside the impact of terrorism as well as the organization of CT departments. Second, the theoretical framework is then tested on a newly collected dataset using panel data analysis. This original dataset comprehends CT bilateral agreements signed by European countries between 2002 and 2017. Treaties have been taken from OSCE reports, UN Treaty Series, and Lexis Nexis. The results illustrate two important aspects. First, domestic features do matter: governments’ composition and citizens’ threat perception are pivotal factors, next to other conditions such as states’ geographical position. On the other hand, the findings show how citizens’ perception of terrorists’ threat is much more important for cooperation than the actual impact of terrorism.	International Relations and Conflict

Experimental evidence on support of and compliance with Covid-19 prevention measures across Europe	While the political, economic and social consequences of Covid-19 are undeniable, governments interventions and actions are critical for mobilizing support and compliance. This paper seeks to contribute to the incipient but fast-developing literature investigating the pandemic by examining how infection incidence, governments’ economic relief plan, and democratic procedures affects citizens’ opinions on the governments’ performance, social cohesion and their willingness to comply with prevention measures. Based on a full-factorial survey experiment implemented in 11 countries across Europe, we facilitate internal as well as external validity supporting causal claims.

2021	0159	408	The causes of trust in government: evidence from conjoint experiments	Trust in political institutions is a core concept in political science and, increasingly, public and elite conversation. Whilst there has been decades of research, the causes of trust are still 'protean' and with little concensus over the most important factors (Citrin and Stoker, 2018). We argue that a part of this is due to the overwhelming reliance on survey research in political trust research, combined with a disparate theoretical approach. To address this, this paper presents results from approximately five nationally-representative conjoint experiments in three countries (the UK (x3), US, and Italy) drawing on a parsimonious theoretical framework which encompasses existing empirical work. Results show that the majority of respondents want the same thing from government: a lack of corruption, competence, and one that works in one's interests. Government features, such as ideology and approval rating, also play a role, with governments at the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum less trusted. We show that there are few heterogenous effects across respondents, indicating that most people want the same objective factors. This suggests that trust research should focus less on the link between objective factors, such as corruption and performance, and more on the individual qualities that link these factors to trust judgements.

2021	0122	82	Ethnic diversity and political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic	During the Covid-19 pandemic, people strongly rallied around political institutions, producing an unprecedented high level of trust into politics. This high level of trust is a crucial foundation for democratic societies’ abilities to tackle the health crisis. In this paper, we argue that social context determines people’s abilities to overcome collective action problems, which, in turn, shapes the extent of the rally effect. Specifically, we propose that local ethnic diversity reduces people’s willingness to trust each other and that therefore a rally effect during the pandemic is restricted to ethnically more homogeneous contexts. We test this argument with geo-coded household panel data from the Netherlands that covers the period before and during the first Covid-19 wave. Models of individual level change show strong increases in political trust as the pandemic hits, but only for respondents residing in ethnically homogenous areas. In contrast, people from ethnically highly diverse contexts maintain their low levels of trust over the course of the pandemic. These findings suggest a deeply entrenched geography in people’s willingness to trust, which is shaped by ethnic divides and is even maintained under exceptional crisis events, such as a global pandemic.

2021	0176	434	From Populism to the ‘Plandemic’: Why populists believe in COVID-19 conspiracies	Why are COVID-19 conspiracy theories so prevalent? Particularly, why would some citizens ignore scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists’ opposition to scientific and political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy beliefs that is independent of political ideology. These findings have important implications for elite communication regarding virus mitigation.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0141	301	Winning the Battle or Worst of the Bunch? How COVID-19 Mortality Data Impacts Perceptions of Government Performance and Health Attitudes	As governments have implemented interventions addressing COVID-19, mortality statistics have varied over time and among countries. But what impact, if any, does this information have on attitudes relevant for politics and public health? In a pre-registered experiment (N = 2,915), we showed UK respondents an image displaying the UK’s cumulative COVID-19 deaths—which remain the highest in Europe—either in isolation or alongside nine other European countries having fewer deaths. Mortality figures in either format did not significantly impact respondents’ concern about the pandemic, support for restrictions, or anticipated behaviors. However, respondents seeing UK-only data, particularly those holding lower trust in government (which was an exploratory test conducted after pre-registration), evaluated the UK’s response more positively compared to the control group. This was the opposite direction from what we had predicted at the pre-registration stage. By contrast, those seeing the UK’s mortalities in context—particularly respondents holding higher trust in government (again, an exploratory test)—expressed more negative evaluations compared to those who saw the UK-only data, which was in line with our pre-registered hypotheses. We attribute these divergent patterns to whether cumulative mortalities or rates of change were more apparent: respondents associated the declining rate rather than high gross figures with government “winning the battle” when relative benchmarks were not present, but punished the incumbent government when its standing among peers as the “worst of the bunch” in terms of cumulative deaths was made visibly salient. Our results highlight the political stakes of information and its communication during crises.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0160	368	Greying Debt: Age and Preferences towards Public Debt	There is growing concern that aging populations, resulting from a combination of increasing life expectancy and declining fertility rates, will add further to already large public debt burdens in Europe. Yet, we know very little about how age and generational conflict influence citizen’s attitudes towards public debt consolidation. Will people’s opinions about the urgency of debt consolidation change as they grow older? Or will they show concern for future generations? Adopting a micro-level perspective, we hypothesise that when people grow older, they are less concerned about public debt accumulation because of their shorter time horizons. We test this argument with a multilevel model and 10-years of Eurobarometer responses (between 2010 to 2019) of 600,000 individuals which report preferences towards public debt consolidation. We find that age has a strong negative correlation with support for fiscal consolidation. This effect is robust to confounding by a variety of demographic, geographic, political and economic covariates. Our findings are highly relevant for public policy because we show that in addition to creating more demand for public spending, an ageing society poses an extra challenge to a country’s financial viability, since individuals’ support for fiscal adjustment declines as they age.

2021	0123	107	International Oversight of Fiscal Discipline	The vast literature on the political determinants of fiscal discipline has primarily paid attention to three sets of factors: political fragmentation, national budgetary rules, and proximity to elections. But political fragmentation has had a diminished influence in western European countries since the 1990s and the impact of budgetary rules is hardly consistent. Extant works pay either no attention or poorly operationalize the influence of the European Union’s excessive deficit procedure, perhaps because it is considered failing and, thus, irrelevant. This study extends the recent work of Fortunato and Loftis (2018) to the 1994-2019 period. It shows that if an excessive deficit procedure is ongoing for the full calendar year when the budget is drafted, a government of a eurozone country reduces, on average, its deficit by 0.46% of GDP, compared to when there is no procedure. Considering the 3% deficit ceiling, this is quite a substantial effect. It almost fully offsets the impact on deficit of a two-year shortening of the expected duration of a government. This result has important implications for the fledgling EU-wide fiscal policy.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0142	165	Compromise under Pressure: Bargaining over Public Spending	In many developing democracies, multiple local politicians have to collectively decide on the allocation of limited public spending. This paper explores the interplay between electoral competition and divided government in shaping these budget allocations. The paper puts forward a novel theory where divided local government can lead to higher welfare spending and lower taxes if both branches face strong electoral competition. Under unified government, both branches of government target spending to the same set of voters, whereas under divided government, they target spending to a different set of supporters. Given the same level of electoral competition, divided government can thus increase the net distributive pressure for a given polity. As a result, public spending will increase for those budget items where benefits can be shared among branches. The paper tests the proposition using a natural experiment in the Philippines where different branches of the local government are elected in separate first-past-the past elections. Exploiting the observational variation in electoral competition for different offices and as-if random variation in divided government, I show that divided government increases social welfare transfer and reduces taxes on property and businesses, but only if both actors face strong electoral competition. Spending for broad public goods remained unchanged. I find further support for the mechanism using qualitative interviews with local politicians.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0185	70	Public Spending, Clarity of Responsibility and Voter Choice	We examine whether voters are more likely to vote to re-elect an incumbent government if they are satisfied with the government’s spending levels in two key areas of social programs: healthcare and education. We also seek to understand if voters are better able to translate that satisfaction (or lack thereof) into rewarding (or punishing) the government in the subsequent election if the government is composed of a single political party and operates under a constituency-based system. The thermostatic model and the literature on clarity of responsibility suggest that voters will reward governments when they spend exactly the right amount of money on social programs and are better able to do so if a single-party constituency-based government is in office. Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems dataset, collected between 2011 and 2016, we test these two hypotheses. In line with our theoretical expectations, we find that voters are in fact most likely to reward governments that spend exactly the right amount of money on social programs like healthcare and education, and that clarity of responsibility means that they are best able to do so when a single-party constituency-based government is in office. Our findings have important implications: governments should be prudent in dedicating government funding to social programs. Single-party governments, in constituency based systems in particular, are most likely to be rewarded when voters think they are spending the right amount of money on social programs and can lose support if they spend too much or too little.

2021	0143	624	The consequences of institutional complexity: How institutional overlap affects the creation and design of intergovernmental organizations	In many issue areas of world politics, international cooperation is governed by a dense network of overlapping institutions. Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are at the core of such regime complexes. Yet, we know little about how this environment of regime complexity shapes the creation and design of IGOs. We offer a theoretical argument that explains the effects of institutional overlap within regime complexes on the creation and design of new IGOs. We argue that states seek to avoid the proliferation of overlapping organizations that provide similar functions to similar sets of member states in an issue area. They do so to curb institutional redundancy and limit the transaction costs and uncertainty of cooperation. When it comes to the design of IGOs, states reduce uncertainty related to the design of new IGOs by taking cues from overlapping organizations, which results in a convergence of designs across the IGOs within a regime complex. To test the implications of our argument, we introduce an innovative quantitative measure of institutional overlap in global governance and new data on the institutional design and governance tasks of the 534 IGOs contained in the Correlates of War Project’s IGO data. Findings from two-stage dyadic regression models support our theoretical argument and point to areas of future research.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0124	273	International Actorness: Exercising Authority beyond Delegation to International Organisations	Who exercises political authority in international politics? Besides autonomy and independence of international actors, in recent years the concept of delegation has grown increasingly popular for explaining the authority of international organisations. This paper argues, however, that the concept of delegation suffers from both empirical and theoretical shortcomings. Empirically, the mere existence of an international secretariat often is sufficient to scholars for identifying some instance of delegation of authority, independent of what tasks are delegated to an international organisation. Conceptually, delegation describes merely one possible relationship between those who have political authority, on the one hand, and those who exercise authority, on the other hand. Moving beyond the conceptualisation of delegation for measuring the authority of international organisations, this paper proposes international actorness a framework for understanding and conceptualising the authority of international actors, describing a rather diffuse boundary between the actorness of international organisations and groups of states. Analysing the relationship between authority and actor as well as the type of actors, this paper identifies four ways of exercising authority in international politics: The sovereign, collective, delegated and transferred exercise of authority. These four types of international actorness appear across different policy areas and do not necessarily correspond to the mere absence or existence of an IO. This paper develops the concept of international actorness as well as the respective typology and presents empirical findings on the four types of actorness.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0161	63	Deliberation in international organizations: What are the benefits and limits of arguing?	Despite considerable attention to the unequal distribution of voting shares in international organizations, many such institutions rarely take votes and rely on consensus-based decision-making instead. This is conducive to deliberation, which holds the promise of effective negotiation outcomes, according to scholars of deliberative democracy. At the same time, powerful member-states frequently achieve their preferences through international organizations. Thus, what is the role of deliberation in decision-making of international organizations? Drawing on scholarship of international political economy and deliberative democracy, I hypothesize that deliberation is able to constrain the interests of powerful member-states at minimum, and improves governance at best. To test these conjectures empirically, I examine meetings in the governing body of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pertaining to developing countries between 1995 and 2014. I introduce new measures of deliberative quality based on dictionary methods and supervised learning techniques. Employing regression analysis, I find that higher deliberative quality in Board meetings is associated with less conditionality in subsequent lending programs, thereby constraining the influence of powerful member-states. However, deliberative quality is not significantly related to the probability of successfully graduating from an IMF lending program. These findings have important implications for IMF governance and for international organizations more broadly. The research questions the widely used approach of deriving preferences exogenously to the decision-making process, but also shows the limitations of deliberation within organizations.

2021	0125	346	Give them the word, they sharpen the sword: How high courts use language to exert political and societal power	Courts exercise political power through opinion-writing. To ensure political compliance with decisions judges activate public support. According to the literature, features external to decision-making -- e.g., holding hearings or publishing press releases -- are sufficient to activate support. From this perspective the substantive content of opinions becomes irrelevant which is implausible: If the content were irrelevant to the public, then there were no reason to hold political actors accountable. However, judges primarily influence political and societal processes through opinion-writing. Thus, how do courts shape publicity through substantive opinion-writing? We argue that courts use linguistic instruments adjusting their opinion-writing to influence publicity. Judges can choose to write in comprehensible ways to mobilize a broad audience or they can write in less comprehensible ways to mobilize a narrow audience. To assess the argument we analyze vagueness and readability as linguistic instruments of Senate decisions made by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Vagueness is linked to the precision in word-choice and readability to the complexity of sentences. Findings show that the publication of press releases and other media outcomes are a function of the way vagueness and readability are combined by the Court. Thus, courts exercise political power through opinion-writing tailoring the substantive content to different audiences. This has major implications for understanding the substantive political impact of high courts and enhances our ability to map the action repertoire available to judges in decision-making.

2021	0177	614	‘As you were saying’: Framing decisions at the Court of Justice of the European Union	A growing literature offers evidence that the CJEU’s interpretations of EU law are shaped by the interests of member states, as judges are well aware that controversial interpretations curtailing national governments’ autonomy are at risk of legislative override and non-compliance. This evidence harbours normative concerns about the Court’s independence from member states: Rather than being driven by judges’ professional interpretations of the law, the CJEU’s decisions appear subject to political calculations and strategic deference to member states. In this paper, we qualify these concerns and argue that the CJEU has means other than outright deference in its toolkit that help the Court to protect its decisions against attempts of legislative override. We argue that the CJEU anticipates controversy and strategically highlights concurring interpretations of EU law held by other EU institutions as well as member states themselves in order to signal political support for its decisions and pre-empt challenges to its jurisprudence. We test this claim, drawing on original data of the CJEU’s references to observations submitted by member states and EU institutions in all preliminary reference proceedings lodged with the Court between 2002 and 2008. Our data allows us to compare the CJEU’s – as we argue, strategic and selective – choice to reference member states and EU institutions’ observations across different political environments with varying risks of legislative override.

2021	0144	429	Mobilizing the public - the importance of mediators for judicial opinion-writing	Highest courts cannot enforce decisions themselves but need to rely on external actors. This is why scholarship argues that courts seek to mobilize public opinion to hold governments accountable to judicial decisions. However, it remains unclear how judges can successfully communicate their decisions’ content precisely to encourage a desired action. I argue that citizens neither carefully read nor fully comprehend judicial decisions. Instead, the court mobilizes mediators to communicate a decision and activate public opinion. I design a formal model including external actors as mediators, the court, and the government. Mediators activate the public to impose costs on a government if it not complies to a judicial decision. Thus, the presence of mediators defines the strategic choices that judges make in opinion-writing. When courts weight their policy preferences higher than the potential costs of non-compliance, then they activate external actors as mediators by addressing them to a greater extent in their opinion-writing. Analyses of Senate decisions published by the German Federal Constitutional Court since 1998 provide empirical support for this equilibrium strategy derived from my model. This has major implications for our understanding of how courts activate public opinion through mediating actors to communicate and enforce their decisions. Further, the model provides a plausible explanation for why non-governmental actors pay the costs to approach the court; namely, to pursue their own agenda.	Political Methodology
2021	0186	310	Inter-judicial Coordination: the key to courts' leverage as international actors.	In the last decade, the UNSC was forced to change its sanctioning standards (concerning targeted sanctions) due to the activism of an unexpectedly strong group of international actors: coordinated national and international courts. Courts probed their capacity to curb powerful international organizations' policy-making standards and to curtail their own governments' margin of political discretion both at the national and international level. Hence, the so-called inter-judicial coordination holds the key to unfold national and international courts' full potential as international actors. First noticed by Benvenisti & Downs, they refer to this phenomenon as 'inter-judicial coordination' or 'inter-judicial cooperation', because the main concern of their remarkable research is not to scientificly define it and distinguish it from other bordering phenomenons. However, from a social scientific perspective, this is not an irrelevant nuance, since these terminologies imply different assumptions about its features. Thus, this paper tackles the pending task of properly conceptualizing this phenomenon, which is of the utmost importance in order to identify and prove its causal mechanisms. Drawing on the insights of the previous literature concerning inter-judicial coordination, this research aims at bringing this rather legal topic into the International Relations literature. Coordinated courts become a legitimate authority to de-fragment the international order and, consequently, to modify the structural circumstances surrounding the states’ international relations and the international organizations' policy-making process. Hence, this research moves away from the traditional state-centric approach of International Relations theory in order to put meso-level actors such as national courts under the spotlight of International Relations.

2021	0162	573	'Equal with Colleagues in a Ring': individual and compositional sex effects on judicial decisions over gender violence	This paper analyzes the role of sex in judicial inequality over gender violence cases. In particular, we are able to estimate individual-level and compositional sex effects in a quasi-natural experimental framework to estimate the effect of lower-court judges' sex on their decisions on restraining orders to victims of gender violence. We find, first, that, controlling for other factors, female judges adopt restraining orders for victims at significantly higher rates than male judges, which is consistent with previous empirical literature. Our second finding is more interesting. Similarly to what happens when decisions are made by panels of judges, we observe that when lower-court male judges work in judicial districts with higher presence of female judges, they tend to adapt their decisions to those of their female partners---i.e., in favor of victims. This suggests that even though judges at the bottom of the judicial system (lower courts) make decisions individually, certain characteristics of their environment (judicial districts) can work as an efficient mechanism of informal social norm compliance, as deicisional panels do at higher levels of hierarchy.

2021	0145	601	Diversionary Discourse: Media and Authoritarian Survival	How do autocrats use media to preserve their power? The literature on authoritarian durability has largely focused on strategies related to repression, co-optation, and legitimation but until recently there has not been much work on the role of authoritarian media. In this project, I propose a new theory for how autocrats manipulate media. I argue that during domestic strife, regimes manipulate the discourse around security threats in order to dissuade the public from taking part in protests. Manipulating security threats reduces dissent by emphasizing urgent threats from an out-group, blaming foreign powers for domestic failures, and showing the regime as the sole protector of the public. I test this theory using a quantitative analysis of hundreds of thousands of articles from Arab newspapers. In addition to the quantitative analysis, I conduct a qualitative case study of coverage in Egyptian regime media of two instances of threats unrelated to Egypt: the London 7/7 attacks and the Paris 2014 attacks. The London attacks happened when there were no significant protests in Egypt but the Paris attacks happened during protests in Egypt, allowing us to examine how protests influenced regime coverage. This project contributes to the literatures on authoritarian durability and the use of autocratic media. It also advances the scholarship on autocratic responses to the Arab uprisings and demonstrates how regimes have reconsolidated in the period after the uprisings.	Comparative Politics
2021	0126	201	Political repression, protest, and citizens’ attitudes towards the state	Does government crackdown on protests related to national elections affect political attitudes? Political-culture research has long considered citizen support of paramount importance for political regimes to thrive and survive. Yet current literature on repression and dissent mainly focuses on how states use coercion and repressive behavior and why individuals participate in protest, but provides little clear evidence as to what extent repression affects citizen attitudes toward the state, and in particular, political trust and support for the government. Our contribution aims to close this gap in the literature by investigating how incidents of state-led violence against protestors influence citizen attitudes towards the political system. Combining survey data on political attitudes from the World Values Survey with event data on election-related contention events from the Electoral Contention and Violence(ECAV) dataset for more than 100 countries worldwide, we use multi-level models to examine the complex relationship between protest, repression, and political support.

2021	0178	532	Repression Will Be Televised: Backlash vs. Local Deterrence	How does information about repression affect protest propensity in an autocracy? Despite substantive research interest, the effect of repression on political uprisings is still unclear, with results ranging from mobilizing to deterring to curve-linear effects. Arguments are traditionally tested on a high level of aggregation, neglecting subnational variation, and most accounts leave open the question of how people gain knowledge about repression - a crucial precondition for any effect to work. I argue that the effect of repression is heterogeneous because it is associated with spatially varying costs and threat perceptions, depending on the distance to the threat. I expect that while repression generally backfires, increasing the overall protest propensity in a country, it deters protests locally at the same time. Moreover, if repression at one protest site is to have an impact on mobilization elsewhere, information about repression must be communicated through a channel that reaches a large share of society. Combining original geo-referenced protest and repression data on the day-municipality in the German Democratic Republic in 1989 with a content analysis of West German television broadcasts, I show that foreign media reports on repression fostered protest diffusion nationwide. At the same time, these reports deterred protests locally. Reports on repression at a specific protest location reduced the subsequent protest propensity in surrounding communities. Conversely, acts of repression without media coverage had no effect on the spread of protests. The findings have important implications for the study of the repression-protest nexus and foreign media effects on regime stability.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0163	530	The Consequences of Selective Authoritarian Repression on Political Behavior	How does authoritarian repression affect authoritarian and post-authoritarian politics? Past research claims that the effect of repression depends, among other things, on the type of violence and target. While indiscriminate violence tends to generate backlash, extant literature exalts the deterring effect of selective repression. This paper claims that the effect of selective violence might partially depend on the social role of the target. Repression towards incumbent socio-economic elites may allow for its more efficient replacement by pro-regime community leaders and yield human capital loss anti-regime dissent structures. Underdevelopment of anti-regime opposition might help scaring-off popular dissent, increase the regime's capacity to co-opt aligned elites, and eventually limit alternatives other than authoritarian successor parties in post-authoritarian elections. This paper examines the implications derived from these claims by drawing on archival records of individual trials executed by the Fascist war court during the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) in Galicia, a territory that the revels occupied without military resistance or the settlement of frontlines. I explore the consequences of highly targeted repression on popular involvement in undemocratic institutions (1940-), and turnout and behavior in authoritarian (1957-1974) and post-authoritarian democratic elections (1977-1996). Preliminary results suggest that opposition decapitation enhances popular support for the authoritarian regime and successor parties. Out-of-sample tests in Chile suggest that this effect might travel to other authoritarian regimes such as military ones.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0164	505	A Distorting Mirror: Partisan preferences and misperceptions of economic inequality	Economic inequality is one of the most debated issues in contemporary times, yet little political action has been taken to tackle increasing levels of economic disparities. Some scholars have argued that one explanation might be people’s distorted perception of their economic situation and of income inequality. The origins of this misperception are still unclear. In particular, the role of ideology and partisan identification remains under-explored and the little research exclusively focuses on the United States. However, if distortions in perceptions of inequality have an ideological leaning, this could have severe consequences for how these views get translated in the political system. Taking advantage of a new survey on inequality perceptions, we are able to evaluate how partisanship affects citizens’ factual inequality evaluations across 14 Western countries. We test how party identification influences people’s perception of their economic situations and their ability to assess the overall level of inequality. We then put this partisan bias in relation with inequality justifications and demands for redistribution. The contribution of this study is double-fold: firstly, we shed new light on the phenomenon of inequality by looking at its psychological roots and secondly, we examine one of its potential explanation comparatively.

2021	0146	581	Distributive justice beliefs and the demand for redistribution: The conditioning role of quality of government	What explains individuals’ demand for income redistribution? Previous research shows that redistribution support is influenced by normative beliefs about distributive justice. These distributive justice beliefs include principles about what distribution is desirable as well as perceptions of whether these principles are satisfied in reality. This study advances the theory that the effect of distributive justice beliefs depends on the quality of government. Higher-quality public institutions lead people who support income equalization to increasingly turn to the state to implement their distributive goals because they can trust that the effects of public redistribution will be desirable. The results of multilevel models using survey data from 40 institutionally diverse countries offer broad support for this theory. The effects of a multitude of distributive justice principles and perceptions increases with quality of government. The results imply that distributive conflict within societies crucially depends on institutional context. They help to explain why increases in inequality do not necessarily lead to increased demand for redistribution.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0127	238	Economic inequality, perceived economic inequity, and populist attitudes	Previous research shows that populism is more widespread among the self-perceived left behind who are discontent with societal development. I extend this line of research by suggesting that anti-elite grievances and political resentment—key ingredients of populism —may flourish in contexts of high economic inequality, when and because individuals perceive income distributions to be unfair. I explore this argument empirically in three steps. First, using data from two German surveys, I test whether perceptions of economic inequity, and social injustice more broadly, are associated with populist attitudes at the individual level. Second, I explore the connection between the reality of rising economic inequality and the perception of economic inequity using different waves of ISSP data since 1987. Third, using data from the 5th wave of the CSES, I investigate whether unequal income distributions are associated with higher levels of populist attitudes at the country level.

2021	0165	188	Connecting descriptive representation in elected bodies to citizen satisfaction with public services	Is there a connection between descriptive representation in elected bodies and citizen satisfaction with public services? Recent studies have begun to observe less visible outcomes of diverse representation. Though both legislative representation and citizen satisfaction literature engage with similar themes such as trust and ingroup advocacy, the two topics have yet to be connected. This paper addresses this gap and posits that descriptive representation in the legislature can be key for improving citizen satisfaction with public services. We apply a unique framework that offers both substantive and symbolic rationales for why there might be a connection between electoral representation and citizen's perception of quality of administrative services. Applying data from an original survey of residents of Haifa, Israel, and using Hayes processing models, we test the relationship between tangible and perceived levels of descriptive representation, trust, and perceptions of legitimacy with citizen satisfaction with public services. Initial findings show that while tangible descriptive representation in elected bodies is important, perceptions of descriptive representation, mediated through citizen trust and level of political alienation, is an even more significant determinant of citizen satisfaction with public services. These findings provide insights into the extensive impact and importance of representation, as well as how we can improve the citizen experience of underrepresented groups.

How the Framing of Positive Action Measures Affects Public Legitimacy	Does public support for positive action to improve gender equality depend on the type of measure introduced? Over the last few decades, the number of countries taking positive action measures to increase women’s political representation, including gender quotas and gender parity measures, has increased significantly. These positive action measures work – research shows that they increase women’s representation, and lead to policy changes in the direction of women’s preferences. However, they are often controversial. Public support for positive action measures varies widely across countries and over time, and emerging literature also points to potential negative impacts of quotas on trust in government. Thus far, we lack an understanding of how the framing and normative justification of these measures affects public support. To answer this question, we use a survey experiment to identify the causal effect of the framing of gender equality measures on public support, and to provide initial evidence on the causal mechanisms driving public support. We assess how support differs depending on whether the positive action measures are described as 1) gender quotas to increase women’s underrepresentation, or 2) gender parity laws to achieve gender balance. Our expectation is that respondents will be more likely to support parity than quotas, given that the latter tend to have negative connotations regarding candidate merit. We also evaluate heterogeneous effects, arguing that sex, gender, social status, and attitudes towards individual responsibility condition support. The findings will shed important light on the conditions under which positive action measures achieve public legitimacy.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0147	496	(When) Does Citizen Engagement affect the Legitimacy of Policy-making? Evidence from a conjoint experiment	Citizen engagement has been praised for improving the quality of policy-making processes. It ranges from one-way written communication from citizens to politicians to more deliberate forms where citizens and policy-makers meet to discuss policy solutions. Apart from the format, the procedures also vary in terms of how popular they are among citizens and how much attention is paid to the views of the citizens participating. We argue that all these elements influence how legitimate citizens perceive an instance of citizen engagement in policy-making. Not only do we expect citizens to prefer citizen engagement to no citizen engagement. We also expect that they judge procedures more positively (1) the stronger the deliberative component of the consultation instrument, (2) the higher the number of citizens who participate, and (3) when the policy outcomes reflect the position of the citizens participating. We test these hypotheses through a survey experiment with a random sample of 3000 Danish citizens, who are presented with a description of a fictitious policy-making scenario. The conjoint design of the experiment allows us to identify the effects of a set of features of citizen engagement across various outcome scenarios.	Comparative Politics
2021	0179	260	Voters' Preferences for Moral Representation	Why do parties use moral rhetoric to explain and justify their policy positions to voters? Conceptualizing moral rhetoric as parties' attempts to represent voters' moral values, I argue that parties use moral rhetoric because it is a type of argumentation that is appealing to a broad set of voters, including both copartisans and non-copartisans. Specifically, I posit that preference for moral rhetoric is high among not only supporters of the party using moral rhetoric, but also among non-supporters who hold highly morally convicted attitudes about politics. Using original survey data from six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the US), I present evidence in support of my argument. The finding that moral rhetoric is attractive to voters beyond the party base provides important nuance to existing claims that morality polarizes and tribalizes politics. The paper contributes to research on party competition, morality and politics, and representation.	Comparative Politics
2021	0187	422	Observing more, but doing less? Evaluating voters’ attitudes towards intra-party deliberation using a conjoint survey experiment.	Voters report greater satisfaction with democracy when they have greater influence in the selection of parties’ leadership and electoral candidates. However, recent changes to parties’ rules, driven in part by the global pandemic, likely impact party leaders’ approaches for managing intra-party groups and potentially limit the average members’ participation in consequential decisions. For example, in 2020, the major UK parties held their conferences online, in many cases, substantially limiting the number of speakers. This potentially tilted the influence away from ordinary, yet made it easier for the average person to watch proceedings. Timed with low participation costs, this change has increased opportunities for observation and transparency, while the diversity of participants in key roles has decreased. In this paper, we describe the results of a conjoint survey experiment intended to evaluate voter and party member attitudes towards these changes. In particular, we vary a series of reforms that relate to the costs of participation for members and the leaders’ ability to control the content of discussions through agenda setting procedures. We further provide varying information on the expected impact of these reforms for the role of individual party members on parties’ decision-making. The results of this experiment hold key implications for parties looking to reform internal institutions while maintaining and growing diverse party memberships.

2021	0166	465	Start Spreading the (fake)News: Explaining how negative emotive language increases the spread of conspiracy theories online.	Throughout history, conspiracy theories have caused prejudice, witch hunts, revolutions, and genocide. They have motivated terrorists, driven people to reject mainstream medicine, and led to the dismissal of science. Belief in conspiracy theories increases partisanship, reduces public policy efficacy, political legitimacy, political engagement, institutional trust, harms public health, and increases the likelihood of political violence. Such beliefs are dismissed as the inconsequential narratives and absurd preoccupation of society's fringe. However, conspiratorial beliefs are ubiquitous in American society, with a majority of Americans believed in at least one conspiracy theory. An important factor influencing individuals' perception of conspiracy theories is their exposure to these theories. This is both intuitive and widely noted in the literature. However, how these theories spread is understudied. This paper holds that the presence of negative emotive language in conspiratorial messaging influences the dissemination of these theories online. The relationship between negative emotive language in conspiratorial messaging and their dissemination is studied through Facebook. This is done by investigating the extent to which negative emotive language in conspiratorial news articles influences the number of interactions they receive. The level of negative emotions will be measured using a dictionary approach on conspiratorial news articles across the United States written media. These article's URLs are matched to Facebook shares through Facebook's CrowdTangle tool. Through this investigation, it is demonstrated that articles that the presence of negative emotions within conspiratorial articles positively influences their dissemination online.

2021	0180	466	Making time to be informed: A panel approach to the transition to adulthood and media consumption.	Modern democracies rely on citizens’ media consumption to perform a variety of activities, from providing information about the political realm to mobilizing citizens. However, the time citizens choose to devote to becoming informed about politics also signals their preferences and motivations regarding obligations and leisure. For instance, more informed citizens are more likely to be politically involved (Strömbäck and Shehata 2010). Not only so, as individuals move forward in their lives, time also becomes a scarcer commodity, particularly as they adopt adult roles. Most importantly, time tends to be unequally distributed between women and men, which appears to be at the origin of some of the gender gaps in political involvement. To date, however, the relationship between media consumption and adult roles remains understudied. Thus, in this paper, we investigate whether the transition to adulthood has an effect on media consumption and whether the effect is different for women and for men. Do adult roles take a special toll on women that is likely to increase the gender gap in media consumption? To answer this question, we use panel data from the Dutch LISS Panel, which allows us to examine the extent to which key life cycle events related to the transition to adulthood shape citizens’ media consumption. The panel structure of the data set is an asset to examine different causality processes for women and men.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0129	480	Who Wants to Talk? Gender Differences in Motivation to Engage in Everyday Political Talk	Norms of deliberative democracy mandate the inclusion of all affected citizens in spheres of formal and informal political discourses. However, previous research has identified substantive differences in participation between citizens, including differences between men and women. While these differences have been thoroughly investigated in spheres of formal political discussions, we know very little about men and women’s behavior regarding everyday political talk. Since participation in informal political talk is mainly limited by individuals’ autonomous choices to engage in it, this study focuses on individuals’ willingness to do so. As previous research has shown, their willingness is dependent on individuals’ motivation, based on their political interest, knowledge-seeking, and internal efficacy, as well as the strength of their relationship to discussion partners. In this study, I present to what degree we can observe differences in the willingness of men and women to talk about politics to strong or weak ties and investigate whether differences in motivations account for the gaps. Drawing on a unique data set from a local face-to-face survey concerning the deliberative practices of citizens in Germany, I show that women are more reluctant to talk about politics than men, especially in respect to discussions with weak-tie counterparts. While the gap disappears for talk with strong-tie counterparts when motivational factors are taken into account, it remains pronounced in respect to weak ties. The results help us to assess the role gender plays in everyday political talk and to what degree this poses a challenge for the norms of deliberative democracy.	Political Communications
2021	0148	531	What Drives us Apart? Disentangling Political Dissimilarities as Impediments to Political Conversations among Ordinary Citizens	Political mass polarization is a major concern in many democratic societies. Yet, societies can be polarized with regard to policy issues, on ideological grounds regardless of issue positions, in the form of partisan affect or all at once. An array of research has shown that these different forms of polarization do not only manifest themselves in a lack of understanding for divergent political convictions but in an avoidance of interactions across lines of difference all together. Given the increased importance of political conversations across lines of difference in light of contemporary research on polarization, this paper revisits the question: To what extent to people avoid having political discussions with others due to political differences? We disentangle which forms of political differences prevent political discussions among ordinary citizens most. Using a uniquely-suited dataset from a German metropolitan area containing georeferenced survey data on respondents and their everyday political conversation partners, we are able to simultaneously study disagreement among political discussants with regard to salient policy issues, ideological positions, and their partisanship. We use a case-control design to analyze how different forms of dissimilarity affect the likelihood of two people discussing politics with one another. We find that dissimilarities on all dimensions (independent of one another) strongly decrease the probability of political conversations taking place. Differences in partisanship exert the strongest effect on the choice of political discussants - especially among politically highly-involved citizens, pointing to the relevance of partisan affect as structuring factor of everyday political interactions in multi-party systems.

2021	0130	326	How political context homogenizes the representation of social groups: Evidence from parliamentary questions at the local level in Germany	It is commonly assumed that parties in European parliamentary systems differ in terms of the social interests that they represent and that ideology is a key factor in shaping parties’ representational profiles. Less attention has been paid to the limitations that contextual factors place on the ability and willingness of parties to represent particular social interests. We suggest that the objective political context makes all competitors more likely to represent certain social groups while ignoring the interests of others. The upshot of the impact of objective conditions on political representation is more homogenous representational profiles of all parties in different political contexts than one would expect based on ideological considerations alone. To test this hypothesis, we rely on a novel dataset of over 22,000 parliamentary questions from 30 German city councils. The local level is particularly suited to analyze the impact of contextual factors on political representation as different party branches of the same party compete in different contexts under otherwise comparable institutional constraints. Therefore, the objective political conditions are the only varying factor that should impact political representation. The study relies on supervised text classification to analyze the representation of social groups in the parliamentary questions. Our results support the expectation that parties adapt their representational profiles to local conditions and that representation behavior converges under different political contexts between parties.

2021	0149	149	From electoral supply to voter perceptions: a new framework to understand ideological congruence between people and representatives	Most studies on ideology congruence between citizens and representatives focus on electoral systems (Proportional vs Majoritarian), without consensual conclusions. With a multilevel analysis based on data of the Comparative Studies of Electoral Systems (CSES), we aim to understand the impact of 3 Independent Variables on ideological (mis)representation: electoral supply (availability of ideologically close candidates); voters perception of candidates ideology; and valence voting (when ideology closeness is simply not important for a voter decision). Compulsory Voting, which receive little attention from the specialized literature, is also addressed. We then perform an electoral 'stepwise' analysis which compares the ideological distribution between 1- citizens and voters; 2- voters and votes (i.e., parties' ideology weighted by the shares of votes) and finally, 3 - votes and seats (each party now weighted by its share of seats), in order to confirm the results of the model above. Results suggest individual cognitive factors are more important to explain congruence than electoral systems, which show no effect either through ideological distortion between votes and seats (disproportionality) or through inadequate electoral supply. These findings suggest focusing on these cognitive factors (or at least controlling for them) and disentangling the noise from each electoral “step” could lead to more precise and longstanding conclusions.

2021	0167	204	Representational Deprivation: Niche Parties, Niche Voters and Political Protest	Political participation has increasingly taken unconventional forms in advanced democracies. At the same time, the traditional party systems of Europe have been upended by the recent emergence of successful niche parties challenging the status quo. While some studies have examined partisanship and protest, we still lack a theoretical framework that ties niche party voters to political protest. In this paper, I argue that niche party voters are more likely to protest than mainstream party voters, especially in cases where they are dissatisfied with the government’s representation of their positions on the issues of immigration and climate change. I then test the theory of representational deprivation, or the sense that the government is not adequately representing the issues the voter cares about, using all nine waves of the European Social Survey in Western Europe. The findings have important implications for understanding the conditions under which people engage in political protest, especially voters of niche parties.

2021	0150	430	Electronic governance and citizen attitudes towards the democratic state	For many citizens in countries of the Global South, the relationship with the state is rather vague and not characterised by high levels of interaction. Low state presence is a particularly strong phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa, where governments are heavily resource-constrained and historically struggle to project and exercise power across their territory. This has major consequences on the relationship between politicians, governments and citizens as well as on the arrangements between formal and informal institutions. Digitalisation, and in particular e-government services reduce the cost and preconditions to engage directly with citizens. They are heralded to offer a powerful tool for weak government institutions willing to reach and engage more heavily with citizens. In this paper, we test the effect of the exposure to e-government services on citizen’s perceptions about how much politicians care for their problems. The results of a randomised controlled trial in cooperation with the tax administration of Botswana and an original survey on the use of e-services and political attitudes in Gaborone indicate that the use of e-services positively affects this perception. These results have major implications on how digital tools can be used and misused to improve the relationship between citizens and the state in democratic countries characterised by low state capacity.

Under these circumstances, what are public attitudes toward foreign travelers in host countries? This study conducts a conjoint experiment to explore the public attitudes in Japan toward travelers from Europe and other regions of the world with varied infection trends. The experiment will be conducted online in early 2021. The Japanese government was criticized domestically for delaying travel restrictions in the early stages of this pandemic. Responding to that, Japan imposed strict restrictions on the entry to Japan for foreigners, including Europeans, with or without permanent residency. However, after the Emergency Declaration was over in May 2020, Japan has been eased restrictions on the entry of foreigners gradually. Notably, there are social pressures to reopen the border toward hosting the 2021 Olympic games in Tokyo. Thus, Japan is a significant case to investigate public attitudes toward inbound travelers. This study contributes to both scholarship and policy debates. Regarding scholarship, this study connects immigration studies with tourism studies, and explores xenophobic attitudes under pandemic. Specifically, unlike earlier research, it shows uniquely whether or not the perceived risk of infection affects public attitudes toward travelers based on Terror Management Theory in social behavior. Regarding policy debates, it shows the conditions under which and extent to which the public agrees with a reopening of borders while controlling for COVID-19. Specifically, it explores how scientific evidence such as the results of PCR or antigen tests changes public attitudes toward inbound travelers.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0168	453	Risky War, Risky Peace: The Gender Gap in Security Preferences	A common wisdom is that women are more dovish and less militaristic than men, so that they are more inclined to disapprove the use of military force on one hand, and to support peaceful resolutions on the other hand. In this paper I present findings from Israel that challenge this theory, revealing that women are less inclined to support the use of military force, but at the same time they are also more hawkish regarding territorial compromises. As an explanation I focus on the role played by the psychological mechanism of risk aversion in shaping individual's attitudes toward war and peace under intractable conflicts, and in particular on the varying levels of risk aversion that lead to gender gap(s) in security preferences. The assumption that women choose to avoid the necessary costs of war and tend to prefer the less 'costly' peaceful solution, ignores the not-so-small potential risks deriving from any peace plan. The consequences of failed peace negotiations can be a deterioration of the situation into a violent episode that would not have occurred had the status-quo remained. Since women are known to be more risk averse than men, they tend avoid the risk of peace resolution just as they avoid the risk of war. Using survey from the years 2001-2019, I examine this hypothesis within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which attitudes toward military actions, the usage of violence and peace plans constitute a major part of public opinion and everyday life.

While we know a lot about elite behavior and the conditions that enable or prevent the transition from a local to a national identity, we know considerably less about how this process played out for the masses in the 19th century. Based on archival work we leverage detailed municipality voting records from all initiatives and referendums in 19th century Switzerland together with a host of other historic data to show how economic and religious factors played out differently in different parts of the country. This dataset allows us to analyze under what conditions minority elites (here Catholic Conservatives) can lead their people into a nation. These results provide new insights into the growth of the modern nation state.	Comparative Politics
2021	0209	277	The effect of minority language acquisition on nationalist attitudes	It is typically assumed that language and national identity are strongly related. However, it is unclear whether the acquisition of a “national” language causes nationalist attitudes. Empirically, it is very difficult to test whether learning a native language causes nationalistic preferences since the correlation between being proficient in the language and nationalistic attitudes could easily be spurious. Hence, in order to answer the question on the causal impact of language acquisition on nationalist attitudes a quasi-experimental design is needed. We do find such a natural experiment in the case of the Basque Country where due to an educational reform the Basque language expanded very quickly after democratization. As a result, for a specific cohort it mattered in important ways in which year they were exactly born for whether they would learn Basque or not. Hence, year of birth is used as an instrument for Basque knowledge to study its causal effect on nationalist attitudes. Our study shows that Basque language acquisition does have a substantial causal impact on nationalist attitudes. Additionally, the paper test different causal mechanisms on the effect of language on national identity and provides evidence that the results can be generalized to other cases of minority nationalism. The study contributes to literatures on nation building, minority nationalism, and the assimilation of immigrants.	Comparative Politics

One must comprehend the internal aspect of the so-called post-truth politics in order to understand the complexities of international relations; however it is understandable that foreign policy think-tanks should focus on the external consequences of the crisis in liberal democracy in Europe. Since the uncertainty unleashed, there has been proliferation of projects to seek 'protect' and even 'save' democracy in Europe. Slogans orchestrated by political leaders like 'take back control' and 'make America great again' make a clear case of this struggle inside this conflict, one that is undermining the very foundations of democracy. The interpretations of the situation vary, We have examined three, a) populism, b) identity crisis and c) the role of technology. We claim that of said explanations, identity crisis is of great significant and should be fully taken into consideration. To proceed with this aim, we start from defining our terms, however ambiguos they may seem, then put them in practice by an empiricist-normative deriven approach, and finally conclude the best way, so called 'comprehensiveness' perspective is urgent.

2021	0210	456	Untangling responses to media discrimination in Sweden and Italy: When and why might media discrimination increase women’s political ambition?	Research gives reason to expect that discrimination against women in political news can both increase and decrease women’s interest in entering politics. This study addresses these differing findings by proposing that while benevolent (subtle and positive in feeling tone) media discrimination may lead to passive cognitive processes such as increased role incongruity, hostile (blatant and negative in feeling tone) media discrimination may lead to active cognitive processes that differ depending on cultural factors. In feminine cultures, there are openly shared values of communality and gender equality, while in masculine cultures, values skew towards individualistic achievement and gender roles remain more rigid. As a consequence, it is argued that hostile media discrimination may increase women’s political ambition due to collective action, feminist-motivated reasons in a feminine culture, where such media leads to stronger anger and opposition. In a masculine culture, women’s political ambition may instead increase because hostile media discrimination makes women strategically distance themselves from female gender roles and instead prefer the political domain so as to protect themselves from personally being targeted by discrimination. These theoretical expectations were tested in an online experiment (N=1,573) in Sweden and Italy, two countries with higher than EU-average representation of women but with extreme difference in cultural masculinity. The study not only contributes to understanding how women interpret and respond to media discrimination, but more broadly adds to the empirical studies of political ambition outside of the North American context.

2021	0231	479	Gendered Communication and Women’s Political Careers in 19 Democracies	Women politicians face a paradox when acting in parliament: on the one hand, substantively representing women pushes women who are members of parliament (MPs) to have a more gendered style and to sometimes focus their activity on so-called “women’s issues”, such as education and healthcare. On the other hand, many voters have a gendered perception of politics, and have harsher evaluations of women politicians. We investigate how these contradictory incentives have influenced women’s parliamentary trajectories in nineteen democracies around the world between 1987 and 2020. We collect more than 11 million parliamentary speeches from those countries, and apply machine learning models to predict, whether each speech was given by a woman or a man. The predictive accuracy is taken to represent the degree of genderedness of the speech and respective legislator: when the classifier has a high certainty that a speech was given by a woman, it is an indication that the speech contains more feminine gendered language. Subsequently, we investigate the relationship between discourse genderedness and women’s progression in parliament over time, more specifically the relationship with tenure, and how they rise through party ranks. Preliminary findings suggest that women MPs have a less distinctively feminine voice the longer they stay in parliament, and that joining the cabinet erases much of the difference in speaking style between men and women MPs. This research helps us understand the individual incentives that shape how women represent women in parliament and the institutional structures that influence this relationship.	Comparative Politics
2021	0189	174	When gender stereotypes matter: media portrayal of Slovak presidential candidates in 2009 and 2019	We know that the media representation of female political candidates is crucial for women’s future political ambition and participation. If women don’t see other women in the position of power, they are unlikely to imagine these positions for themselves. While their presence in public discourse matters, how female candidates are portrayed is no less important. The research has demonstrated that female candidates are often depicted in a gender-stereotypical way. Men are associated with agentic traits. In contrast, women are ascribed communal characteristics, such as being honest, compassionate, collaborative, and willing to compromise. Many of these traits are generally seen as a disadvantage in the competitive political arena. However, as Funk, Hinojosa and Piscopo (2019) found, under certain political and economic conditions, gendered discourse can benefit female candidates. I test their theory on the media discourse during the campaign for the Slovak presidential elections in 2009 and 2019, which featured two strong female candidates Iveta Radičová who lost to the male incumbent in the second round and Zuzana Čaputová, who became the president. Using a combination of quantitative text analysis and discourse analysis, I explore the gendered nature of media discourse about these candidates and their challengers. I show that gender-stereotypical depiction could have helped Čaputová, in particular, the emphasis on her honesty amidst unprecedented protests following the murder of an investigative journalist who pointed to corruption scandals linked to high-level politicians. However, stereotypical portrayal could have worked against Radičová, as Slovakia faced severe consequences of the global economic crisis.	Political Communications
2021	0248	42	We see Symbols But Not Saviors: Gender Representation and the Political Attitudes of Working-class Women	How does female representation in politics affect working-class women? Despite their increasing presence and importance in the workforce, many women continue to concentrate in occupational sectors characterized by high economic vulnerability and low social status. This dynamic has important implications for the politics of representation. Previous studies have demonstrated that female politicians positively affect women's political attitudes. We argue that while class dynamics are present in any instance of political presentation, gender representation has a larger class impact among female voters. This is because there exist higher standards of accountability and relatability for female representative among women voters. Given such high expectations, there is greater room for dissatisfaction among working-class females when they constantly experience occupational segregation despite high female representation in politics. We find strong evidence for our argument using cross-national data from 31 OECD countries as well as four consecutive waves of Danish survey data. Our findings show that in countries with a higher degree of gender-based representation, there is more skepticism among women in low-skilled sectors towards voting and leadership. In these settings, female voters with high-skill jobs are more likely to believe that voting and leadership matters. In contrast, the class impact of gender representation is weak among male voters. Beyond individual perceptions, the additional analysis of voting choices suggests that gender representation increases low-status female workers’ electoral support for far-right nationalist parties. These findings have important implications for the symbolic representation of marginalized groups and democratic accountability.	Comparative Politics
2021	0232	339	Should We Worry About Experiments in Online (Panel) Surveys?	Experiments have become a common resource in political scientists’ toolkit. At the same time, studies of political attitudes increasingly rely on online surveys. The affordability of online surveys has promoted the use of experiments, as well as the development of online panel surveys that track changes in political attitudes. Most online surveys rely on the sampling frames of commercial firms, which are, in turn, based on a pool of respondents (panelists) recruited by these firms. While most commercial firms rely on a large pool of respondents, it is fair to assume that most of their panelists take several surveys each year. This can be problematic inasmuch as the effects of experiments conducted in one survey (or a previous wave of a panel survey) might affect the attitudes measured in another survey (or a subsequent wave of a panel survey). In this paper we assess this threat relying on a 12-wave online panel survey fielded in Spain. The survey includes 18 experiments on a diverse set of topics, as well as multiple measures of political attitudes. This paper analyzes if experiments conducted in a previous wave affect the attitudes measured in a subsequent wave. Moreover, we assess if the type of experiment, the experiment’s topic, the timing between waves, as well as the quality of debriefs moderate these effects. The results of this paper will not only be of interest for those using online panel surveys, but also for all those who rely on commercial firms to field online surveys.	Political Methodology

Analyzing a natural experiment from Mexico, in which a political party uses lotteries to select candidates for national public office, this paper presents new insights into how access to elected office shapes the institutionalization of new parties. I find that MORENA was able to build local party networks through access to office (around elected legislators) that subsequently mobilized new voters for the party. More specifically, I show that the party was able to organize more successfully and grow its party membership base in localities that at random received access to public office through an elected legislator from the same locality. The findings highlight the importance of access to state resources for the success of new parties and have important implications for debates about democratic representation and accountability.

2021	0190	295	Assessing the relative influence of party unity on vote choice: Evidence from a conjoint experiment	Observational studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that internal conflict hampers a party's electoral performance. Yet, party unity manifests in multiple ways and the relative importance of acting united as compared to other factors such as ideology for vote choice remains unknown. In this study, we present novel experimental evidence of the suggested effect of party unity on the vote. By implementing a conjoint design in a probability-based survey of the German population, we causally identify direct effects of several distinct aspects of party unity on vote intention. Besides establishing a causal relationship, our design allows us to evaluate the importance of party unity as compared to other relevant factors such as ideological distance and various candidate characteristics. Our individual-level analysis confirms the importance of a cohesive image on electoral support. We also show that, while ideological considerations are by far the dominating factor in determining vote choice, internal conflict in parliament and during party congresses noticeably deter voters. Viewed from a different angle, appearing united can compensate for substantive policy distances between parties and voters. These findings have important implications for the literature on spatial models of voting and crucially expand our understanding of the effects of (intra-)party politics on vote choice.

Candidate selection is a key function of political parties, with implications for the functioning of the party system, the legislature, government and opposition. Despite the extensive literature on intra-party candidate selection, few studies examine why parties choose particular methods of candidate selection and/or the relationship between parties’ appeals to voters and their choice of candidate selection methods. Using a re-conceptualization of parties’ appeals to voters based on “representational claims”—what and who parties claim to represent—I argue that accounting for parties’ engagement in both the politics of issues (appeals on policy positions) and the politics of identity (appeals to demographic groups) provides a better insight into parties’ choice of candidate selection methods. Specifically, I hypothesize that parties that focus on a narrow demographic appeals are more likely to use more exclusive candidate selection methods (where the body selecting candidates is small), compared to parties with a broad demographic appeals, with the purpose of ensuring that the identity of the candidates reflects the party’s demographic focus. Following a discussion of intra-party candidate selection and an explanation of the proposed typology, I test my hypothesis on all parties that have gained seats in the Israeli and Dutch parliaments 1977 and 2015 for which data on intra-party candidate selection is available and discuss the implications of the results.

Candidate selection criteria and preference diversity in parliamentary debate	The pool of potential candidates and rules regulating their selection limit the diversity of MPs contained in parliamentary parties. Yet, procedures for selecting among potential candidates unequally equip party leaders for managing the diverse coalition of members. Selection procedures range from the abdication of control to voters to complete dominance by leaders. Differences in the degree of leader control alter the degree of freedom held by members to raise issues. Building on an intra-party politics perspective, we propose that variation in candidate selection rules influences the distribution of preferences represented in parties’ parliamentary delegations. We argue that parties with rules favoring the leadership will decrease the range of preferences over key issues by members of the parliamentary party. Greater diversity in preferences emerges when parties apply fewer restrictions on candidate participation. We add that the impact of the party’s internal selection rules will apply not only between parties, but also in the same party across venues with differing procedures. To test hypotheses from this perspective we exploit the difference in many European parties’ selection criteria of parliamentary candidates for the national and European parliaments. Using data on parties’ selection criteria and preferences expressed through their election campaigns, we compare the effect of parties’ election campaigns on the content of parliamentary speeches using a supervised multi-lingual scaling model for estimating preferences over European policy-making in 11 European countries between 2009 and 2019. Results from these analyses lend support for a theory that considers intra-party rules for decision-making from an institutional perspective.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics

While the literature on causes and consequences of electoral reforms are receiving increasing attention, we lack a systematic micro-level account on how parties and candidates adopt to changes in electoral rules and district boundaries. This paper examines the case of the Japanese Liberal Democrats to explore how the party has managed to accomodate a surplus of incumbents to a reduced number of nominal tier seats following the 1994 electoral reform. By using micro-level data, I examine how the LDP has matched candidates based on their expected electoral strength and ideological position to new districts. Moreover, I investigate how the newly instituted party-list allowed the LDP to avoid its disintegration at the local level by systematically defusing local stand-offs through the handing out of promising list positions. My findings help to understand how the LDP could avoid its disintegration and could continue to dominate Japanese politics up until today.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics

A growing literature shows both that dynastic politicians enjoy a considerable electoral advantage and that this advantage has played a key role in facilitating women’s access to political office. While existing research identifies several mechanisms behind these patterns, the role of voters has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we start filling this gap by studying whether voters have a preference for (or against) politicians with dynastic backgrounds. To explore this question, we conduct a survey experiment in Pakistan, a country where dynasties are common, both in general and particularly in the case of successful female candidates. We find that members of dynasties are perceived to be of lower quality and seen as less likely to support universalistic policies compared to their non-dynastic peers. Moreover, learning that a politician has dynastic ties decreases respondents’ reported likelihood of voting for them but not their perceived electability, suggesting that the electoral advantage of dynastic candidates is explained by elite-driven mechanisms. Finally, we also uncover evidence of a double standard, with dynastic female politicians being perceived as particularly susceptible to the influence of their families but not dynastic males. Thus, while political dynasties have significantly increased women’s descriptive representation, they have also generated a so-called “label effect” that reinforces negative stereotypes about women in politics.

We examine whether this mechanism helps to explain public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by an uneven distribution of deaths and economic hardship. Drawing on pre-registered survey experiments conducted in 14 countries during the second wave of the pandemic in December 2020, we test whether the salience of the pandemic and information about its unequal impact increase average support for higher taxes on the rich. An analysis of effect heterogeneity explores whether the pandemic reinforces or dampens existing socio-economic cleavages concerning tax progressivity. Altogether, our findings shed light on the political consequences of the pandemic and the micro-foundations of preferences for taxes and redistribution.	Comparative Politics
2021	0192	489	Limited Impartiality: The Effect of Quality of Government on Economic Insecurity	Economic insecurity is a strong predictor of social policy preferences and political behavior. But what drives economic insecurity and why individuals with similar characteristics report different levels of economic security in different countries? Previous research has found that economic and labour market conditions explain (perceived) economic insecurity better than the welfare state. I take instead an institutional approach and argue that the quality of government(QoG), i.e. corruption, rule of law, bureaucratic efficiency, affects (perceived) economic insecurity and the heterogeneity of risk pools. Using hierarchical models with data from ESS modules 4 & 8, I find that good governance is associated with lower economic insecurity and its effect is substantially stronger among the rich than the poor. In countries with bad governance, the rich and the poor experience similarly high levels of economic security; but the rich feel substantially less insecure than the poor in countries with high quality of government. The institutional stability and predictability associated with good governance provide a stronger safety net for higher-income groups. These findings have strong implications not only for research on QoG and economic insecurity but also on social policy preferences and inequality.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0234	178	Perceived Inequality and Populism	Rising inequalities have been described as a fertile ground for populist parties all over the globe. But are individuals who perceive resources in society to be unequally distributed really more likely to support populists? In this article, we present novel evidence on this important question based on a comprehensive comparative analysis across 14 countries based on the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) which we complement with survey experiments in three selected countries. Results from the ISSP point out that in some countries voters who perceive strong inequalities in society are more likely to support right-populist parties like the Progress Party in Norway, Danish People's Party and the Freedom Party of Austria. The comparative survey experiment in Norway, Germany and Italy strengthens the causal interpretation of these findings. Manipulating the perception of societal inequality using factual information about the distribution of income and wealth in the countries increases populist attitudes and the propensity to vote for populist parties. These findings speak to current debates about how macroeconomic changes in inequality became a pre-condition for the rise of populist parties all over Europe.

2021	0235	627	Liberty, Security, and Accountability: The Rise and Fall of Illiberal Democracies	We study a model of the rise and fall of illiberal democracies. Voters value both liberty and economic security. In times of crisis, voters may prefer to elect an illiberal government that, by violating constitutional constraints, offers greater economic security but less liberty. However, violating these constraints allows the government to manipulate information, in turn reducing electoral accountability. We show how elements of liberal constitutions induce voters to elect illiberal governments that remain in power for inefficiently long---including forever. We derive insights into what makes constitutions stable against the rise of illiberal governments. We extend the model to allow for illiberal governments to overcome checks and balances and become autocracies. We show that stronger checks and balances are a double-edged sword: they slow down autocratization but may make it more likely. We discuss the empirical relevance of our theoretical framework and its connection to real world examples.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0193	68	Self-Government Interrupted: Legacies of External Rule in Brazil and Poland	Which consequences do sustained interruptions in local self-government have for subsequent periods of democratic engagement? In this study, we develop a theoretical framework of how interruptions in self-government influence citizens’ ability to recognize transgressions of democratic norms and engage in electoral behavior or other forms of collective action against the perpetrators. Our theory suggests that, even long after self-government has been formally restored, previous sustained interruptions in self-government can damage citizens’ ability to recognize and respond to transgressions of democratic rules by governments. In the empirical test, we examine the consequences interruptions of local self-government by the central government in Brazil as well as interruptions in self-government across Poland by external powers.

2021	0262	432	Fragmented Sovereignty After Conflict: A Survey Experiment in Iraq	In post-conflict settings where state and non-state legal orders coexist within the same territory in a situation of 'legal pluralism,' what factors determine individual preferences among alternative providers of justice and order? When and why do people choose to resolve disputes through non-state systems of adjudication-whether tribal or religious-rather than resorting to state police or courts? Does the type of dispute and the identity of the other party affect which legal system is chosen? Through a survey experiment conducted in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where the population has been exposed to three different justice systems--state, tribal, and the Islamic State's extreme interpretation of sharia-we explore the relationship between state legitimacy and support for non-state legal authorities. We also expect, among other hypotheses, that Iraqis who stayed in Mosul after the Islamic State (IS) arrived in June 2014 ('stayers') are more likely to prefer non-state legal authorities, whether tribal or Islamic, over state legal authorities in comparison with those who fled to government-controlled areas ('leavers'). Our results have important implications for efforts by governments to establish legitimacy in areas where their sovereignty has been challenged by non-state actors.

2021	0214	216	Citizens, Parties, Institutions: A Three-Stage Model of Democratic Backsliding	A growing number of countries has experienced democratic backsliding across the globe in recent years. Previous research has mostly focused on the role of either citizens or political actors in that process, waiving the potential dynamics between citizens, parties, and institutional change. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model of democratic backsliding in which citizens' growing anti-democratic attitudes first lead to an increasingly illiberal party system. Subsequently, both dropping democratic commitment of citizens and more illiberal party systems trigger a dynamic of democratic backsliding, a process in which liberal democracies come under attack. I probe this model by combining data on citizens, parties, and political systems. At the citizen level, I leverage a Bayesian dynamic latent trait model (Claassen 2018) to estimate smooth country-year panel observations based on a wide range of survey datasets from 1990 to 2015. I develop a novel index of illiberal party systems based on the V-Party dataset to measure the extent to which anti-liberal democratic orientations in parties are prevalent in national party systems. A panel analysis of the effect of changing citizens' democratic attitudes and illiberal party systems on the deterioration of liberal democratic quality in 98 countries provides evidence for the proposed three-stage model. The results suggest that dynamic between anti-democratic developments in both citizenries elicits democratic backsliding.	Comparative Politics
2021	0250	541	Institutional Manipulation in Electoral Authoritarian Regimes: Effects on Candidate Behavior	Most of the literature on institutional manipulation in autocracies is devoted to examining the effects of election manipulations' consequences for regime survival and post-election protests and manipulations' effects on the voters' perceptions and attitudes. However, whether facing institutional manipulation influences candidate behavior is still under-investigated. I focus on a common form of institutional manipulation in electoral autocracies - candidate filtering - and investigate to what extent being restricted from running as a candidate in a race affects the decision to challenge the regime in the future. I argue that stronger challengers, who were refused registration as a result of manipulation, would be more likely to participate in the race in the future, in comparison to those who were not filtered and lost to a regime-affiliated candidate. I test the argument on the case of Russia, a prominent example of an electoral authoritarian regime, where candidate filtering has been in use since the early 2000s. I focus on over 25000 local executive and 315 regional legislative elections in 2004-2020.	Comparative Politics
2021	0236	311	Curb EU Enthusiasm: Categorising the Commission’s legislative ambition.	What drives legislative activism by the EU Commission in some policy areas and legislative apathy in others? Which policy areas does the Commission prioritize when seeking to widen or deepen the EU policy competencies and why? In this paper, we argue that the Commission behaves strategically when deciding whether to expand the supranational authority in a policy domain. The Commission exploits the politicization dynamics and opts to broaden the Union competences over policies that are seen as salient by the population of the Union and/or widely supported by the European citizens. Yet, when faced with a substantial political discord among the member-state governments, the Commission is likely to turn to consolidating the pre-existing EU’s policy competencies rather than seek to broaden them. Unpacking these distinct rationales of responsiveness, the study sheds light onto the underlying reasons for the puzzling overall decrease of legislative activity of the Commission in the post-Lisbon period. To map the variance of the legislative activity of the Commission across policies and over time, we analyze the content of the legislative proposals submitted between 2009-2020 using cutting-edge text-analysis techniques. We rely on Eurobarometer surveys and national parliamentary debates to obtain information on the preferences of the EU public and member-states governments, respectively. Our results add to the extant literature on EU responsiveness and contribute to a better understanding of underlying determinants of divergent speed of integration across policy areas and over time.

2021	0263	593	What kind of EU do the citizens want? Studying multi-dimensional institutional preferences using conjoint survey experiments	To tackle the EU's persistent 'crisis of legitimacy', many institutional reform options are on the table: new participatory instruments, more effective policies, or a more differentiated European integration. But what kind of EU do the citizens want? In this paper, we analyze to what degree European citizens derive their legitimacy beliefs from different facets of the EU's institutional design. We argue, first, that EU citizens generally prefer a Union that is more participatory (input), more transparent (throughput), and delivers effective policies (output). Second, however, we believe that people's legitimacy beliefs also strongly depend on their previous dispositions towards the EU and European integration. While Eurosceptic citizens prefer a differentiated Union with strong intergovernmental elements and relative benefits for their own country, Europhiles demand a less differentiated EU with a more supranational character that works for all countries similarly well. We test these theoretical expectations by conducting original conjoint survey experiments in six EU member states (Denmark, Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Spain) with 2,000 respondents in each country. The results carry important implicants for the future of European integration. They imply that relatively broad reform coalitions among citizens should be feasible for reforms that increase the EU's input, output, and throughput legitimacy. However, reforms that touch upon the existing power distribution between Brussels and the member states are likely to be highly contested.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0215	305	From bill to law: how the complexity of policy proposals evolves over the European Union’s legislative process	The content of policy proposals changes to varying extents over the course of the legislative process. In some instances, the text introduced by the agenda setter is almost left untouched by the decision-makers; in other cases, the final act hardly resembles the initial proposal. Yet, despite its strong relevance for the field of legislative politics, the question of how this variance can be explained is still unresolved. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of how legislative proposals evolve before they become law by focusing on changes in their complexity. Specifically, we investigate how the complexity of more than 2,000 policy proposals adopted by the European Commission between 1994 and 2020 changed during their respective legislative negotiations. We employ a text-as-data approach to measure several indicators of policy complexity, track the changes of these indicators as the Commission proposals move through the EU’s legislative process and analyze the degree to which institutional and political factors help to explain the existing variance in complexity change. In particular, we put our theoretical focus on the inclusiveness of the decision-making process and on the preference heterogeneity of the involved political actors. The analysis thus adopts an innovative perspective on the analysis of legislative negotiations and sheds new light on the crucial question of how legislative institutions and political actors jointly shape the complexity of policy output.

2021	0194	234	Supranationalism: Attachment to Europe and Support for Transnational Political Issues	How does supranational attachments influence attitudes on political issues such as immigration and climate change? Scholarly work on supranational identities such as European identity have predominantly focused on opinions towards the EU and EU-related policies. Yet, the literature lacks an understanding of how these supranational attachments influence opinions on other political dimensions, such as the emerging transnational cleavage. I argue that feeling attached to the EU demonstrates an attachment to a political community that transcends borders, which is then reflected in opinions on transnational issues. Using data from the European Social Survey, I show that attachment to the EU increases support for immigration, concern about climate change, and support for policies designed to combat climate change. These findings have important implications for how we understand attitudes on increasingly salient issues in European politics as well as how attachments inform those attitudes.	EU Politics
2021	0251	452	Responding to Change? Analysing the Complexity of European Parliament Election Manifestos	Manifestos are an important channel for political parties to communicate their positions on a wide range of policy issues to both the electorate and the media to attract votes in an election. While a rich scholarly literature has evolved around the question of how party policy positions differ across time, countries and contexts, little is known about whether and how parties adapt the style of their manifestos in response to institutional changes in their environment. European Parliament (EP) elections provide an ideal case for studying this question since the EP has experienced major changes concerning its role and scope for policy-making since the first direct elections in 1979, therefore substantially changing the relationship with the electorate. I argue that given the EP’s empowerment alongside the need to secure an increasingly enlarged and polarized electorate’s support, parties competing in EP elections have normative and strategic incentives to draft simpler manifestos over time. I investigate to what extent parties are responsive to such institutional developments by analyzing changes in the complexity of their language in EP election manifestos from 1979 to 2019. The findings show that Euromanifestos overall have become more complex over time, which potentially is the result of increased policy complexity and a greater number of standpoints that need to be incorporated. However, there are substantial differences between parties and within manifestos depending on issue salience and issue ownership. The findings have implications for our understanding of parties’ responsiveness to institutional change.	EU Politics
2021	0237	562	It's where you live, stupid! The re-emergence of the right-wing in Spain.	Where you live matters. But is it so important as to be the phenomenon that causes the re-emergence of right-wing parties? By geo-localizing the inequalities of the administrative boundaries in Spain, a de-centralized country, I perform a natural experiment taking advantage of the exposure variations. I exploit these differences by a Geographic Regression Discontinuity approach, which allows to estimate how the territorial distribution failure has produced an increase in the right-wing voting in the 2019 elections. As a result, the more affected voters seem to react against the current situation by seeking a reversion to previous territorial stages, similar to the situation generated after the economic crises. Therefore, this context is reflected in the vote for pro-recentralization parties, which in Spain are represented by right-wing forces.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0216	147	Women's electoral success and mass mobilization: evidence from individual voting data	This paper brings individual level evidence to the hypothesis that female candidates empower women to vote. With a regression discontinuity design, I analyse the effect of close victories of female direct candidates in gender-mixed races at the federal elections in Germany in 2013 on individuals' decisions to turnout at the federal elections in Germany in 2017. The results indicate no effect of women winning a close electoral race on female turnout in the future. These findings hold even when considering intermediate and possibly compensating channels affecting turnout, such as effects of a female candidate winning on the economy of the electoral district or the electoral districts' candidate composition in the upcoming elections.

2021	0252	607	Campaign Donations, Family Loyalty, and Kickbacks	What motivates citizens to donate to political campaigns? The literature has characterized donors as those who wish to receive a direct benefit from an elected official or as citizens who just want to express their affinity for a candidate through a donation. We argue that family members who donate to candidates follow a more expressive affinity compared to private donors, and donation patterns over time should differ for both types of donors. We track donors across several elections and using a close election regression discontinuity design in a sample of Colombian municipalities, we find that donating to the winner of the mayoral race significantly reduces the probability of donating in the next election. Consistent with our theory, such an effect is larger for family members than for private donors. Moreover, unlike family member donors, private donors are more likely to receive public contracts when donating to an election winner and more likely to donate in the next election after receiving a public contract. This paper points at evidence that both expressive and benefit-oriented donors coexist and actually have different behaviour across time.	Comparative Politics
2021	0195	524	Local Economic Effects of Morales’ Legacy in Bolivia: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design	Left-wing governments are often associated with income redistribution through higher taxes and social spending. Evidence on the effect of partisanship on local redistribution in developing countries is mixed. This paper explores the impact of Bolivian mayors representing Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), Evo Morales' party that governed Bolivia between 2006 until 2019. I test whether municipalities with MAS affiliated mayors show a higher reduction in inequality and increase in economic growth, relative to the opposition, during their governing period. The analysis contributes to the literature on redistributive policies implemented by local governments and its effects on local poverty and inequality reduction in developing countries. Based on the literature, I anticipate that MAS’ mayors fulfil voters’ demand for redistributive policies in congruence with the party’s ideology and show a higher reduction in inequality during their governing period. The analysis relies on satellite night light pixel data as a proxy for yearly economic growth and yearly change in inequality within municipalities. I use a close election discontinuity design for the three recent municipal elections. I find that MAS’ mayors have no significant impact on the metrics of inequality and economic growth I use. The findings have implications for local governance and responsiveness in developing country contexts.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0253	504	How the communication of deferred enforcement affects compliance. A field experiment during the COVID-19 crisis in Uruguay	Economic measures implemented to fight Covid-19 are forcing low- and middle-income households across the Global South to cut payments for basic goods, such as electricity .Consequently, many households risk losing formal access to electricity. This has consequences for reliable and secure access for individuals, but, high levels of informal consumption also threaten sustainability of electricity systems as such. Through a randomized control trial we evaluate a recently introduced debt-installment policy by the public electricity company UTE in Uruguay on reducing electricity informality. We send information treatments in the form of letters to non-poor households who accumulated debt during 2020. We test the effect of a policy reminder designed to raise awareness of the policy, combined with horizontal and vertical reciprocity treatments, on the likelihood that households remain formal consumers. We analyze the effect of different treatment arms using administrative data on individual payment behavior and original survey data, thus analyzing behavioral and attitudinal changes	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0217	159	The Politics of Travel Restrictions Among European Countries	We analyze travel restrictions between European countries during the second wave of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. We suggest that at the dyadic level, travel restrictions are a consequence of the interplay between epidemiological, economic, and political logics. The epidemiological logic for travel restrictions suggests that source countries i implement travel restrictions for travelers from target countries j if the source country has lower incidence rates than the target country or if the source country goes into a hard lockdown. The economic logic for and against travel restrictions perceived travel restrictions as a consequence of a source’s dependence on tourism. If a source country depends on income from international tourism, it will implement relatively few travel restrictions when it has relatively high incidence rates. If however a source country dependent on tourism has relatively low incidence rates, it can use these as marketing advantage and defend those by implementing moderate travel restrictions for all target countries or even high travel restrictions for selected target countries. Finally, the political logic of travel restrictions suggests that state capacity influences the ability, but not the willingness of countries to implement travel restriction. We also explore whether a political stance against migration increases the political willingness to implement travel restrictions. Preliminary estimates support our epidemiological and the economic case for travel restrictions. We do not yet have estimates for the political determinants of bilateral travel restrictions.

2021	0264	568	The Limits of Populist Parties at Power during the Times of Crisis	The pandemic situation, caused by COVID-19 outbreak, has put many governments around the world in an unprecedented situation. Despite the fact that many countries have crisis management mechanisms in place, the extent of the pandemic and the need to apply large-scale protection measures and restrictions have shown that existing crisis plans have not always been set up sufficiently. In addition, the fight against the pandemic has become part of political competition, influencing the elections during the pandemic and having an impact on relations between ruling parties and the opposition. Moreover, parties that have come to power in many countries recently, often adapt and adjust their policies and actions according to the public opinion (populist parties, business-firm parties). Since the pandemic outbreak these parties have been in charge of imposing restrictions and protection measures in order to slow down or stop the spread of COVID-19 infection. The aim of the paper is to focus on how the public opinion has influenced the actions taken by governments ruled by such parties, with particular emphasis on the Czech Republic and Slovakia, since in both countries the leading coalition parties belong to the group of populist and / or business-firm parties – the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens 2011 (ANO 2011), resp. the Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OĽaNO). The theoretical context will be provided by the theory of business-firm parties and populist parties.	Comparative Politics
2021	0238	436	Preferences for authoritarian rule among Eastern European citizens in response to COVID-19	Countries across the world have implemented extraordinary measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. Most democracies have addressed the pandemic with ‘no or only minor violations of democratic standards’ (VDEM2020). In the flawed democracies of Eastern Europe, there are growing concerns that these extraordinary measures, many of which curtail individual rights and freedoms, may, in the long run, jeopardize civil liberties and constitutional democracy and work to further weaken liberal democracy. How do Eastern European citizens react when faced with executives’ abusive power consolidation? This article argues that the experience of COVID-19, along with the related constitutional breaches in Eastern Europe, has sparked greater public acceptance of authoritarian rule among citizens. We present survey experimental evidence from Romania and Czechia, two Central Eastern European countries with contrasting levels of authoritarian attitudes, and document that individuals' fear and anxiety related to the pandemic makes them more acceptant of practices incompatible with normal democratic norms, irrespective of prior levels of trust in political institutions and of political socialization during authoritarianism. The results have important implications for understanding the longevity of support for liberal democracy in new democracies.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0196	564	The Effect of Ambiguity and Motivated Reasoning on COVID-19 Behavioural Inferences	A key challenge in COVID-19 public health messaging is that recommendations are often ambiguous. This is because public health appeals are often necessarily nuanced and cannot provide detailed instructions about appropriate behaviour in all possible circumstances. Further, conflicting advice from overlapping jurisdictions – federal, provincial, municipal – may increase ambiguity. This leaves individuals to infer appropriate behaviour in many day-to-day circumstances. When people confront ambiguity in expert recommendations, they may resolve uncertainty by ignoring recommendations they dislike. This is because individuals engage in “motivated reasoning”. On one hand, people do not wish to be wrong, and so accept information they believe will lead to accurate inferences. At the same time, when information is inconvenient—e.g. by being inconsistent with preferred behaviours—people are more likely to accept information consistent with those preferences and reject/ignore inconsistent information. Ambiguity creates “wiggle room”, allowing people to interpret government recommendations in ways consistent with their underlying preferences. People eager to resume normal life may use motivated reasoning to interpret messaging to infer that certain behaviours are appropriate when they are not. We test the hypothesis that ambiguous public health recommendations will result in motivated reasoning by those with priors that are inconsistent with the recommendations through an online survey experiment.

2021	0218	357	Beyond the neighbourhood, but not too far: reconsidering the effect of the immediate environment on citizens’ perceptions of the economy	A growing number of studies investigate the role of local factors on individuals' perceptions of the national economy. Some of those studies showed that individuals use local economic conditions to infer the state of the national economy. What remains unknown is the extent to which individual mobility mitigates the impact of the local economic conditions on the perception of the national economy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that when considering the impact of the local economic context on the perception of the national economy, it is necessary to take into account the mobility between the two places where citizens tend to spend most of their time: home and work. To do so, I use large administrative data from the US census bureau tapping the unemployment rate at the census block level, information on where workers live and work and surveys on political preferences retrieved from the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) to measure the perception of the national economy. By means of this study, I aim to contribute to the literature on local politics and economic voting by giving a more complete picture of the context in which an individual lives and the effect of this specific environment on economic perception.

2021	0197	155	Economics and Elections: The future agenda	What is the future of economic voting? In this “think piece”, we begin with a literature-based assessment of economic voting across democracies to establish a baseline from which to peer into the future. As we look to the future, we consider how critical economic events and trends could affect this relationship through the economic, social, and political contexts in which elections take place. We examine how the pandemic, climate change, migration, inequality, polarization, and party fragmentation might impact the relationship between the economy and government support. Will voters be more likely to attribute responsibility to the government and thus strengthen the relationship between the economy and election results? Or, will the economy-vote link deteriorate as attributions to individual citizen actions increase or as a result of international conditions that are beyond the control of national politicians? The answer depends on which event/trend we consider and the complexity of how these changes interact. With this theory-driven piece, we hope to set the stage for the next generation of research on economic voting.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0265	67	Seeking for Shelter: The Sectoral Basis of Economic Voting in Austria	Democratic societies are characterized by increasing polarization between winners and losers of internal and external economic liberalization. Despite tight politico-economic constraint on national political actors, parties in government are willing and able to interfere in this process by creating and maintaining shelters from international market pressures. With popular demand for socio-economic risk-hedging grossly outweighing governments’ efforts to provide pockets of shelters, we propose that sectoral agency translates into a highly salient topic that informs voters’ choice of party. Specifically, we probe into ‘loyalty’ gaps to emerge over multiple rounds of elections. We expect mainstream clientelistic parties ('machines') to underperform with voters in ‘exposed’ occupations, including former core constituency of both Social democrats and Conservatives. We employ a quasi-experimental ‘difference in differences’ design for that matter and open by looking into the likely case of Austria. Findings corroborate our main hypotheses for both major centrist parties based on arguments derived from developmental theory, the literature on comparative political economy and party ideology, and premises established in the literature on public perception of social justice.

2021	0239	557	The Political Economy of Detention Centres and its Impact on Vote Choice in the 2020 U.S. Election	Recent scholarship tends to find more evidence for symbolic, rather than economic, theories of vote choice. However, most studies examining economic voting fail to take account of the political economy of vote choice in geographic areas dominated by industries that clearly stand to gain or lose by a candidate’s victory or defeat. This research challenges the literature on symbolic and economic voting, by leveraging precinct and individual-level data in the context of the 2020 presidential election among the 25 counties that comprise South Texas -- a region dominated by Mexican-Americans and individuals who work in border patrol and immigration enforcement. The Trump Administration expanded these industries and promulgated harsh immigration policies highlighted by child separation and detention. As a result, these industries and those working in them experienced great vitriol from liberal Democrats, many promising to “Abolish ICE.” We hypothesize that relative to the 2016 vote, precincts located near immigrant detention facilities, ICE field offices, and border patrol headquarters, will show disproportionate swings towards Trump in the 2020 election. Second, we hypothesize that individual-level vote switching from Clinton (2016) to Trump (2020) is better predicted by whether an individual works in immigration enforcement or knows someone who does rather than an individua’s racial or anti-immigrant attitudes. Our results have implications for theories of vote choice and for understanding ethnic minority politics.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0254	561	Retrospective Voting under Supranational Constraints	Economic voting is commonly seen as a cornerstone of democratic ac-countability. Influential work has argued that globalization attenuates it byblurring responsibility and constraining the room to maneuver of domesticgovernments (Hellwig,2001). Here, we test whether this argument extendsto another factor that also reduces policy maneuver: membership in Supra-national Institutions. In a pre-registered survey experiment fielded in Spainin May 2018, we manipulate both information about economic performanceand about the Eurozone rules that constrain domestic policy-making. Theevidence provides no support for theroom to maneuverhypothesis: unlikeglobalization, supranational constraintsdo notattenuate accountability forbad economic outcomes. Instead, they lead to a backlash against both the in-cumbent and other mainstream parties. We interpret the evidence as sugges-tive that voters blame these parties for having consented to the supranationalrules in the first place. These results show that the room to maneuver ar-gument formulated by the globalization literature cannot simply be extendedto membership of supranational organizations. This has important implica-tions to understand the electoral consequences of integration in internationalorganizations and the capacity of incumbents using them as scapegoats.

Before coalition governments take over executive offices, they typically engage in intensive coalition negotiations and publish a comprehensive coalition agreement in which they provide a detailed account of the policy reforms they plan to enact in government. However, previous case study evidence shows that only about two thirds of all the policy reforms promised in coalition agreements were actually enacted. Despite its importance, the question of how coalition governments translate policy promises into policy has received little academic attention to date. In order to address this gap, we develop a new theoretical argument on policy implementation in coalitions. More specifically, we argue that the decision not to enact policy pledges can be explained by the preference configuration within the cabinet and by changes in public opinion. To test our argument, we have compiled a new comparative dataset on the enactment of more than 12’000 policy pledges by 102 coalition governments in 24 Western and Eastern European countries from 2000 to 2015. Our results have major implications for our understanding of coalition governance, multiparty competition and policy making in multiparty democracies.	Comparative Politics
2021	0240	503	How Voters Predict Coalition Bargaining Outcomes	Multiparty parliamentary democracies present an interesting problem to voters: in order to cast a policy-oriented vote, they must first come to have some expectations of how likely various coalition governments are to form following the election. While there is some research suggesting that voters do, in fact, possess such expectations, it is unclear how they are generated. We present an ecologically rational theory of how voters form coalition expectations and derive global and contextual (i.e., cross-nationally variant) empirical expectations. To test these predictions, we design an experimental platform that allows us to learn the rules voters use to infer which parties will coalesce, as well as how these rules vary across contexts.

2021	0219	641	Cooperation and Competition: Coalition Governance and Timing of Bill Initiation	In coalition governments, ministers' agenda-setting power depends on their coalition partners. A minister facing a cooperative partner is less constrained than a minister facing a competitive partner. While ministers may not know their partner's type at the beginning of a government's term, in this study we theorize that, over the term, ministers form and update their beliefs about the competitive or cooperative type of their partners after observing the level of scrutiny of their bill proposals, and respond by strategically timing their subsequent bills. We derive this implication theoretically, through the development of a dynamic model on the timing of ministerial bill initiation, and demonstrate it empirically, from data on bill initiatives from 11 parliamentary democracies. Our results demonstrate that a minister strategically delays bill introduction the more she experiences scrutiny, the more her partner has policy incentives to scrutinize her bills, and the less power she has to constrain scrutiny in parliament. These findings further our understanding of legislative efficiency in coalition governments and why governments quickly adopt or delay policy reforms demanded by voters.

This literature, however, does not take into account coalition-directed voting, which has been found to matter for vote choice in many parliamentary democracies. According to this literature voters are likely to consider not only which party they prefer, but also which coalition they prefer and how realistic a chance it has of forming. We argue that a context of “repeat elections” due to a failure to form a government may be uniquely beneficial for distinguishing between vote switching derived from party considerations to switching derived from coalition-directed considerations. Such context provides the voters with an opportunity of changing their vote according to possible coalition-building consideration while already knowing the approximate distribution of party preferences in the electorate. We take advantage of the extraordinary Israeli political context in 2019-20, in which three election-cycles were held within less than a year without a coalition forming. We utilize a unique panel data based on three original online surveys. Findings show that voters are more likely to switch their vote when they expect their previous choice of party will not enter the coalition in the coming elections. We also find that the expected formateur and the level of competition between formateurs matter for vote switching.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour

In Germany, for example, all mainstream parties have sworn off cooperation with the far-right AfD, at least in part because they believe that their voters would not support it. However, the German center-right, and indeed many center-right parties across Europe, regularly cooperate with parties that hold far-right views, such as Fidesz in Hungary, in the European Parliament and other EU institutions. Using an original survey experiment with over 8,000 respondents, this project explores the extent to which cooperation among parties at the national and EU levels is tolerated by voters and why. The paper addresses questions including the following: Does cooperation with extreme parties at the national level actually lead voters to view the party they support more negatively? Do voters overlook cooperation with extremists at the EU level simply because they are unaware of it, but punish it as they would at the national level once made aware of it? Or do voters view cooperation at the supranational level less harshly than they do at the national level? Do they react similarly to parties on the far-left as they do to parties on the far-right, and to parties taking authoritarian stances, regardless of ideological positioning?	EU Politics
2021	0241	126	A truly European contest? Transnational media reporting on political parties’ electoral performances across EU member states	How does the media report about of European Parliament (EP) elections? Despite the supranational nature of EP elections, media reporting on the election results often focuses on the electoral performance of domestic parties. In this paper, we ask whether and how the media also covers election results of parties in other EU member states and investigate this phenomenon by combining theoretical stipulations regarding news values, politicization of EU integration and the horizontal Europeanization of national public spheres. Based on a content analysis of 64 newspapers in 16 member states following the 2019 EP election, we find that a significant share of media reporting addresses the election results in other EU member states. Using a spatial lag model, we argue that spatial and cultural proximity between countries and the news value of individual parties (and their electoral success) affect whether foreign media outlets report on the results of those parties. Additionally, populist parties are more likely to be reported upon transnationally compared to other parties. The findings indicate that national media create a limited European public sphere: while EP elections are not fully treated as supranational events, the media does cover election results from other EU member states. Yet, the coverage is likely to be biased towards spectacular und surprising results of parties with (mostly) polarized issue positions.	EU Politics
2021	0220	213	Being populist when you need it? On the strategic usage of populist rhetoric in parliamentary debates	Today, hardly any political debates occur without accusations of someone making a populist argument. However, it is not yet clear whether populist rhetoric is empirically really as common as one might think and, if so, what its effects are on parliamentary debates and legislative behaviour. To answer these questions, I quantitatively analyse more than 300,000 speeches given in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2017 by combining a novel supervised machine-learning approach based on a crowdsourced sample of speeches with word embeddings, dictionaries and unsupervised topic models. In addition, I incorporate longitudinal public opinion data from 28 European countries to show that elites use populist rhetoric strategically and that the presence of populist rhetoric in parliament depends on factors such as issue salience, polarisation and party positions. The contribution of this paper is twofold: Methodologically, it develops a novel, quantitative measure for populist rhetoric in parliamentary debates. Substantially, it thoroughly investigates the effects of populist rhetoric on parliamentary debates as well as voters and thus how populism transforms European Politics.

Existing explanations focus on domestic-level factors like party systems or economic performance. However, voting is not solely a product of domestic causes. Thus, I shift focus from the domestic space to the international arena. Specically, I test whether voters exposed to information about European Union influence in identity policies (i.e., outgroup policies, like migration/asylum or the employment of foreigners) are more likely to support nationalists at the ballot box. Results from a pre-registered, candidate-choice conjoint experiment in Slovakia show that, while respondents favor nationalist policies generally, reactions to EU influence in identity politics are limited to certain subgroups. Specifically, respondent ideology plays a moderat- ing role. Liberals shift towards nationalism in response to EU influence, while conservatives do not. These findings point to ceiling effects in nationalist voting. Only those who have yet to reach the nationalist ceiling can be swayed.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0266	296	What is the fuss all about? Testing the impact of high-information environments on people's knowledge about the EU	After the rejection of proposals in referendums, scholars claim that the outcome produces a shock creating a high information environment. However, the impact of high-information environments on knowledge has not been tested so far. This paper aims to close this gap by addressing how the vote in the EU constitution referendum of the French and Dutch citizens is impacting the knowledge on the constitution and the EU in general. The referendum is an interesting case, as countries vote separately on the same issue- the constitution – but at different points in time. By relying on the literature on cue-taking in referenda, I argue that election outcomes, especially surprise outcomes can serve as a stimulus to gather information. Using Eurobarometer questions on the knowledge quiz on the European Constitution and the EU, I employ a local RDD design in time, testing if people before and after the referendum are substantively different concerning their knowledge on the constitution and the EU. The analysis shows a significant but small effect on knowledge gain with regard to the Constitution. The findings contribute to our understanding of how people are impacted by election outcomes and how people update their knowledge, especially on complex political bodies like the EU.

Many problems plague cross-country studies, but the phenomenon of media credibility is particularly susceptible to these issues (different political environments, language barriers, etc.). This study leverages a new dataset published by Facebook to study the prevalence of fake news on Facebook across over twenty countries in Europe. We use a supervised model (trained on US data) to predict the credibility of a given news domain based on users’ feedback and behavior. We then analyze the prevalence of unreliable news and the news diet of Facebook users in states of varying democratic quality. We find an East-West divide between countries in Europe with higher proportion of unreliable news in former socialist countries, as well as in the UK. Furthermore, we find that more recently registered news domains and those registered outside of the country are more likely to be the sources of unreliable information.	Political Communications
2021	0200	513	Measuring a European Public Sphere in Political Online Search	Search engines are commonly used for online political information seeking across the globe, yet it is unclear to what extent political search predictions vary across countries and over time. We provide the first systematic analysis into the representation of European and national politicians as well as an event of high European salience (Brexit) in search engine autocompletions. Our dataset collection includes predictions in nine European countries on the basis of proxies for the geolocations for European party leaders, Spitzenkandidaten in the 2019 EP election, and cabinet members. We characterize the variation and volatility of the search engine predictions for the same politicians and issues across countries and over time. These data allow us to estimate to what extent online users search for similar attributes of European politicians, how much search suggestions spill over across European countries, and whether a common European public sphere in search engine suggestions exists for Europe's political elite and the issue of Brexit. Finally, we discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the method and possible future directions for studying the European public sphere in political online search.	Political Communications
2021	0242	352	Citizens as Inadvertent Pollsters? The Effect of Contact Networks on Citizens' Forecasting Skills	Partisan preferences usually stand out as the major driving force behind voters’ expectations about election outcomes. Although other variables, such as political knowledge or education, are found to exert a positive influence on the ability of citizens to anticipate the results of political races, the effect of these variables is quite modest in most cases. Hence, it seems that purely individual-level factors (apart from party identification and political leanings) hold limited explanatory power. Some studies argue that we need to move from the strictly personal sphere to the interpersonal one if we are to better understand the underpinnings of forecasting abilities. This paper leverages data from 48 elections at the district, regional, and national levels in nine different countries (i.e., Austria, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to assess the impact of ‘contact networks’ and network characteristics (such as network size or the frequency of political discussion and disagreement) on citizens’ electoral expectations. The analyses also rely on data obtained from two question modules that were included, specifically for this study, in the 2019 Canadian Election Study and the 2020 Saskatchewan Election Study. The results cast some doubts on the capacity of social interactions to influence citizens’ forecasting skills.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0257	372	Tweeting about the environment in a European campaign. Are candidates to the European Parliament responsive to citizens’ environmental concerns?	Environmental concern has risen in Europe in recent years and the 2019 European election took place in a context in which EU citizens considered the environment as one of the most important issues facing their country and the EU. I argue that this, together with the fact that environmental issues are particularly relevant in EU policy and that citizens generally acknowledge the importance of EU action in this domain, should have provided politicians with incentives to be responsive to citizens’ environmental concerns and, hence, incorporate environmental issues in their campaign. This would imply that an EU policy issue was relevant during the campaign and would contradict the ‘second-order elections’ theory that posits that parties mainly focus on national topics. Such finding would add to the literature strand that indicates that European issues are relevant in European elections, highlighting the importance of such elections. At the same time, it would suggest that citizens’ environmental concerns are being represented in the EU system (at least to some extent). I test whether this was the case by analysing the impact of citizens’ environmental salience prior to the 2019 campaign on politicians’ environmental salience. The latter is computed through a quantitative content analysis of tweets of candidates in top positions posted during the three weeks before the election, covering eight EU countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain). Salience is measured with tweets because these represent a direct communication from politicians to citizens and have a larger reach than party manifestos.

2021	0201	146	Tweeting Politicians: A Comparative Study of Activity and Influence	Political elites increasingly use Twitter and other social media platforms to spread their views. Yet, it is hard to come by comparative and up-to-date statistics that would tell us how active and influential politicians, as well as parties, are on these platforms. The present study attempts to provide a descriptive, comparative, and up-to-date overview of Twitter activity/influence across politicians, parties, and parliaments in different countries. It analyzes around 15 million tweets by around 4500 active politicians. Thereby, the study relies on data generated by a framework that collects the corresponding Twitter data on a daily basis. This framework allows for up-to-date statistics and comparisons across different levels and time periods and develops methods that help in comparing the activity and influence of different politicians. The here found variation in terms of activity and influence acrosspoliticians, parties, and parliaments calls for more explanation on different levels of aggregation.	Political Communications
2021	0222	394	Parties promise a lot, but nothing relevant? How issue ownership and voters’ priorities influence prospective pre-electoral statements	Do political parties take the importance of issues at a given election into account when outlining promises and actions for the future? While a growing body of research shows that parties fulfil the majority of their campaign pledges, previous studies have rarely addressed the process of pledge making. In this paper, we provide the first comparative study explaining issue emphasis in statements about the future. More specifically, we address three questions: First, do parties talk more about the future in policy areas they “own”? Second, are parties more likely to address policy areas that are most important to voters (and in particular voters of their party) in statements on future actions or outcomes? And third, how do these dynamics vary between government, opposition, and challenger parties? We shed light on these open questions by applying supervised machine learning to a novel text corpus of over 500 machine-translated party manifestos from over 110 elections to identify statements about the future and their policy areas. We match these data on future-oriented issue emphasis with comparative survey data on “most important issue questions” and responses regarding parties’ issue ownership. The results of our study have important implications for our understanding of parties’ campaign strategies, issue salience, and political accountability.	Political Communications
2021	0243	599	Uncivil mobilization or countermobilization? Explaining anti-rights collective action in Chile	We explain anti-rights protests in Chile drawing on social movement and power devaluation theories. To understand this phenomenon, we use regression analyses of longitudinal, municipal-level data and case studies of three recent movements. Movements seeking to restrict others’ rights have increased across the world in the past few decades. Their activists struggle to defend privilege and preclude the social inclusion of historically disenfranchised groups such as women, ethnic, sexual and gender minorities, and immigrants. We call these groups anti-rights movements. Despite the global importance of these movements, no studies have so far systematically analyzed their emergence in Latin America. Drawing on social movement and power devaluation theory, we evaluate the social, cultural and political causes of anti-rights mobilization in Chile. The explanations we find highlight the reactive quality of protest events and the role that supportive political authorities play in triggering them. To reach these results, we use a mixed-methods design. First, we use longitudinal, municipal-level data from the COES Social Conflict Observatory to carry out zero-inflated negative binomial regressions of anti-rights protests events between 2009-2019. Second, we illustrate the processes behind these mobilizations with three case studies: movements against the right to abortion (2015), transgender rights (2017), and indigenous people’s rights (2020).

2021	0223	347	Taxation, Protests and Autocratic Regime Stability	Taxation is often viewed as instrumental to state-building. However, major historical events, from the French Revolution to the American war of Independence, have demonstrated the disruptive potential of tax introductions and reforms that were deemed widely unfair. Taxes can thus also break states, yet no systematic evidence on this exists. This paper investigates the relationship between taxation and regime stability in non-democracies, where citizens cannot hold the government accountable through the ballot box, and resort instead to protests to express their discontent. I demonstrate that tax introductions destabilize authoritarian governments, and that the effect mostly comes from collective action and mobilization in response to indirect taxation. Using an original dataset of tax protests in fifteen Sub-Saharan African countries, I further show that the incidence of explicit tax resistance varies with domestic institutions, resource wealth, and ethnic composition. These results offer key insights into the link between redistributive politics and authoritarian regime stability.	Comparative Politics
2021	0267	604	Using the Space to (not) Voicing Preferences: Empirical Evidence From Catalonia	A voluminous literature in social sciences pays pride of place to the role of social context in the way individuals express their preferences in the public domain. The predisposition to voice opinions publicly is shaped by social perceptions about the degree of acceptance of such opinions in the social environment. But which factors influence these perceptions? Building on the Sociology of the Space theory, I try to provide an answer to this question by pointing to the role of the social environment. Beliefs of appropriateness, I argue, are based on group-size dynamics, which help individuals evaluate which opinions are “legitimized” and which are “stigmatized” in the public realm. Citizens who belong to the minority group in terms of preferences related with salient issues may face the dilemma of preference falsification through which they forge in public what is true in the private sphere (Kuran, 1991). I put this idea into the test by looking at the case of Spanish citizens holding centralist preferences in Catalonia. Using longitudinal survey data (2004-2017) from the Institut de Ciències Polítiques i Socials (ICPS) and the Centre d´Estudis d´Opinió (CEO), I show that the relationship between Catalonia and Spain increases as a salient issue since 2010. Then, I leverage the identification strategy by using differences-in-differences estimation. There is a declining pattern in the willingness to declare the vote intention for those citizens who live in pro-independence majority regions within Catalonia and hold centralist preferences after 2010.

2021	0202	651	We are your pack: feminism mobilization and social change	What are the consequences of feminism? Although widespread knowledge points out to social movements as promoters of social change, existing evidence is still mainly limited to policy reforms, being this scarcity especially striking in the case of the feminist movements. Despite their extraordinary salience in recent years, scholarship has mostly failed to identify the potential behavioral effects of women's mobilizations—-namely, does feminism lead to pro-feminist social change or, on the contrary, to a backlash against female empowerment? While recent evidence associates the salience of the #metoo movement and awareness towards sexual harassment, the mechanisms through which this behavioral change occurs remain unknown. This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of women's mobilizations and social change by delving into the Spanish feminist movement. On the 8th of March 2018, the Spanish feminist movement experienced a breakthrough after achieving to gather protests all over Spain and mobilizing one of the most significant demonstrations in Europe. Relying on administrative data and using a difference-in-difference estimator, I look at the effects of the 2018 Women's day protests on behavioral change by assessing its impact on gender violence reports at the quasi-municipal level. By distinguishing whether violence remains stable and there is an increase in the number of reports or the contrary, or the opposite, this study's contribution would be twofold. First, it broadens our knowledge of the possible changes brought by social movements. Second, it increases our understanding of the possible positive effects of feminism in society.

2021	0258	546	To Resign or Not to Resign: Why Incumbents Ignore Peaceful Mass Protests?	This article examines why incumbents facing non-violent demonstrations resign or remain in office. It presents a theoretical framework to analyse five major anti-government protests in Bulgaria (1990-2014) and select protests in Serbia, Romania and Macedonia. Incumbents remain in office if they perceive the extra-institutional and electoral threats to them as low and unlikely to increase. They resign if either threat is high or increasing. To remove incumbents from power, peaceful protesters must employ an electoral strategy. This article builds on the social movement and colour revolution literatures, while underscoring the relationship between barricades and ballots.	Comparative Politics
2021	0244	387	Ready for the floor? Intra-party determinants of the allocation of legislative speeches	Parliamentary speech is an important and highly visible feature of legislatures in all democracies. Time in parliament is scarce and not every member of parliament (MP) can speak on all topics they want to. Party leaders play a crucial role deciding who gets to speak on which topic in many countries; in others MPs individually request access to the parliamentary floor. As legislative speech is mostly used to send policy signals, party leaders have incentives to closely monitor who they pick for which topic – and MPs have incentives to present their potentially diverging opinions. While a number of scholars have researched the descriptive characteristics of speakers in parliament in recent years, their policy positions have usually at most been mentioned in passing in the literature on speech allocation. This paper looks into the relationship of policy differences between MPs and their party leaders, and the allocation of parliamentary speeches within parties. It also analyzes, whether institutional differences in regards to floor access matter. We use textual data from Twitter, a social media platform popular with politicians where they can publish direct and unsolicited political statements with little party control, to estimate the positions of MPs on multiple policy dimensions using correspondence analysis. As data from social networks are very noisy, this step is preceded by exhaustive data cleaning and sorting out of non-political content using a machine learning algorithm. We then use these positions to model floor participation in parliament in multiple European democracies with different institutional settings.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics

This paper studies the conditions under which legislators become specialized in specific policy areas, while others remain generalist when speaking in parliament. A growing literature has investigated the institutional and partisan conditions that lead to different levels of floor participation. Still, it remains an open question about which topics do MPs speak when they do so. We consider that MPs’ specialization arises as a result of a dynamic interaction between MPs and their parliamentary leadership. In particular, this specialization process will be a function of rules regulating access to floor time, party leaderships’ preferences and MPs’ ambition and promotion structure. We test our arguments using the German and Spanish cases from 1996 to 2017. Concretely, we merge a comprehensive dataset of oral questions, previously coded according to the Comparative Agenda Project coding scheme, with MPs’ personal and partisan data. Preliminary results show that seniority is associated with specialization while participating in more committees leads to speaking about more topics. Interestingly, when a party platform is focused on a small set of issues (i.e niche parties), this is reflected in their MPs behaviour during the whole legislative period.

2021	0259	122	Beyond the government-opposition divide: Opposition parties' systemic role and their parliamentary behavior in multilevel systems	The conventional view of parties in parliamentary systems is that parties perform different functions depending on their majority status. Whereas governing parties perform legislative and elective functions, the control of the executive falls to the opposition. We argue that the distinction between the parliamentary activities of government and opposition becomes blurred in multilevel politics. As parties join governments at various levels, they tend to develop a governing ethos, which results in a less confrontational and more issue-centered style of executive control – even when parties are nominally in opposition. To study the proposed effect of parties’ systemic integration on their parliamentary behavior, we analyze parliamentary questions in 30 German city councils. The data enable a strong comparative research design, as local parties operate in different political contexts, suggesting different behaviors under the conventional model. To quantify the substance of the parliamentary questions, we use supervised text classification to label approximately 22.000 parliamentary questions that were submitted in the 30 city councils over the course of one legislative period. The results indicate that more systemically integrated parties are more likely to ask issue-centered and conciliatory parliamentary questions even when they are in opposition, whereas parties further from majority status exhibit a more confrontational style that is aimed at embarrassing the executive.

2021	0203	551	Signaling to voters? Conceptual problems of testing signaling models in legislative studies.	Many papers in legislative studies make implicit or explicit reference to signaling models, when explaining the behaviour of Parliamentarians. However, the underlying logic of the game-theoretic approach is often insufficiently reflected in the discussion of arguments and hypotheses. In consequence, it is often unclear what exactly is tested when the hypotheses are confronted with data. Core problems are that it is often unclear a) Whether the underlying game is actually a signaling or a cheap talk game, b) What kind of equilibrium to expect (separating, semi-separating, pooling), and c) What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibria and how to translate these into the empirical world. I will discuss the three problems based on examples and make suggestions on how to improve empirical work based on signaling models.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0225	189	The Prevalence and Impact of Gender Blindness on Political Science Research	In recent decades, the topic of gender blindness is increasingly gaining scholarly attention. Even in fields that do not commonly engage with gender studies, such as medicine, engineering, and computer sciences, gender blindness has been recognized as a factor that possibly biases research outcomes, and thus has the potential to limit the validity of findings. Motivated by this recognition, this paper explores the prevalence of gender blindness in political science, and its implications for research outcomes. We ask two questions. First, how prevalent is gender blindness today in mainstream political science research? Second, how might gender sensitive analysis change outcomes of political science research? We answer these questions in two stages. First, we assess the prevalence of gender blindness in all articles published in the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) in 2018 and 2019 (N=114). Next, to demonstrate if and how outcomes and theory are affected when gender sensitive analysis is applied, we select a number of studies from the years under observation and reproduce their results with the addition of gender sensitive analysis. Our findings indicate that gender blindness is very prevalent in political science research and is indeed affecting outcomes. Men and women frequently respond differently to political phenomena, but this is often missed in current political science research. Accounting for gender could yield more accurate results, alter theory, and offer a more refined understanding of political behavior and phenomena.	Political Methodology

In the past, scholars have explored this question by modeling it as a psychological mapping process: elites focus on particular features of policies and map them onto particular psychologically relevant categories, such as “adversary” or “danger,” each of which usually has one or more action implications. The problem with understanding policy interpretation in this way is that it requires specifying multi-level rules by which particular words or phrases, in order to be mapped onto categories, are first mapped onto context, with the contexts themselves being mapped onto higher-level contexts, and so on ad infinitum. As an alternative, we reconceive of policy interpretation as a matter of nonhierarchical textual entailment, in which different combinations of syntactic and semantic information will be associated with stylized accounts of what is, or might, or should not be happening and why. Specifically, we use machine learning techniques to generate newspaper accounts (actual or possible actions, attributed motives, and so forth) of two lengthy streams of policy announcements: one, covering 24 years, from the White House and State Department about the Soviet Union/Russia; and the other, covering 51 years, from the Federal Reserve, about monetary policy.

This methodological approach requires shifting researchers’ traditional analytical focus from protest as a single political act to the ways in which political actors combine protest with other political behaviors. From a theoretical perspective, the study examines the increased salience of research on the causes and consequences of protest in the context of individuals’ broader participation repertoires in contemporary democracies. From a methodological perspective, an illustrative analysis is conducted using the 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) survey to test theoretical expectations about the relationship between civic duty and protest. The study concludes with a discussion of how latent class analysis can be used to advance research on protest as one political activity in individuals’ broader repertories of political participation.

2021	0245	644	Helping or Sanctioning? Heterogeneous Effects in the Strategic Analysis of International Compliance	To address non-compliance, scholars controversially discuss which type of state - an incapable or an unwilling type - determines the structure of the game between an international organization and a state. Observational studies accordingly attempt to identify the dominance of one of the two types when they use conditional mean estimators, such as probit or logit, for a set of covariates, which describe the players' utilities. In this paper, we show that averaged effects can lead to biased or even false identification of state types. We introduce a strategic quantile model to reveal heterogeneous effects in strategic sequential games of compliance.

Secularization and Secular Cultural Voting in Western Europe (1981-2008)	Whereas cultural issues have come to dominate political agendas of Western-European democracies in recent decades, comparatively religious and secular societies tend to feature very different cultural conflicts. On the one hand, religious societies, best exemplified by Ireland or Northern Ireland, have witnessed decades-long battles over same-sex marriage and abortion. On the other hand, the most secularized Western-European countries rather appear to be divided over secular issues of immigration, law and order. This secular cultural cleavage refers to the authoritarianism-libertarianism divide between the high- and low-educated. Higher educated individuals tend to hold libertarian views and are more likely to support the progressive New Left. Their lower educated counterparts, in contrast, rather tend to hold authoritarian views and to vote for the New Right. While most studies hold that this education-based cleavage has been growing in recent decades in Western Europe, in this paper we rather seek to explain why it happens. To do this, we develop a theory of how secularization in the West inspires the rise of this secular cultural cleavage and test it by means of multilevel regression modeling. Using the data from to the four waves of the European Values Study data (1981-2008) for 17 Western-European democracies, we study (1) whether the effect of education on voting for the New Right is stronger in more secular societies compared to more religious ones and (2) whether the (expectedly growing) effect of education on voting for the New Right is not direct but is mediated by values, namely by authoritarianism-libertarianism.

2021	0246	458	Why So Different? An Analysis of the Cross-National Differences in the Ideological Extremism-Voter Turnout Nexus	An important question for contemporary democracies is whether and the extent to which the high degree of ideological extremism, observed in many democracies, affects citizens’ electoral participation. While prior work has provided evidence of the link between ideological extremism and citizens’ electoral behavior, analysis of the Integrated Module of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) reveals large cross-national differences in that link. Specifically, in some countries, ideological extremism mobilizes citizens to vote in elections. In others, the opposite is found. And in a third group of countries, ideological extremism actually exerts no influence on citizens’ voting behavior. In this article, I perform the first analysis of these differences by studying the moderating role of party polarization. I hypothesize that the voting gap between ideological extremists and moderates will increase with party polarization as ideological extremists would have a party option that is more proximate to their ideological position and, consequently, they would perceive more utility from voting when party polarization is higher than when it is lower. Testing this prediction with the Integrated Module of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), I find evidence in support of it, result which stand up to several robustness checks. As such, this article provides important knowledge on the relation between ideological extremism and voter turnout.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0226	303	Ambivalence Across the Globe: Investigating the Effects of Political Ambivalence on Vote Switching in 51 Multi-Party Systems	Since the past two decades, vote switching has been on the rise. An under-researched dimension of this phenomenon is the impact of ambivalent political attitudes. Whilst the effects of ambivalence on vote switching have been investigated in the American political system, its application to multi-party systems has not been explored. In this paper, I extend the investigation of party and leader ambivalence to a variety of multi-party systems across the globe. For this research purpose, I use data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systemsincluding 51 countries with multi-party systems. The results provide empirical support for the hypotheses and show that party ambivalence and leader ambivalence increase voters’ probability to switch parties at two consecutive elections. Therefore, this paper highlights once more the importance of ambivalence on understanding the underlying determinants of electoral volatility in 21st century politics.

2021	0269	525	Electoral volatility – what can we learn from panel data?	Electoral volatility is understood as a change in support by voters from one party to another in subsequent elections. It is usually pointed out that electoral volatility leads to many negative phenomena that reduce the quality of democracy (Bielasiak 2002, Innes 2002, Powell and Tucker 2013). On the other hand, some researchers draw attention to the positive aspects of electoral volatility (Bartolini Mair 1992). The problem of electoral volatility is particularly important in the case of democracies in the first years after the transitions from authoritarian regimes, e.g., in the post-communist countries in 1990s and the 2000s. High levels of electoral volatility were recorded there. Electoral volatility is usually measured by comparing the percentage of support for particular political parties in subsequent elections. This approach is associated with several problems. One of them is to ignore the phenomenon of electoral absence. Another problem is not paying attention that electoral volatility is partly caused by changes in the party system (Powell Tucker 2013). In this paper, I will present analyses of electoral volatility in Poland obtained using the POLPAN panel data. These analyses are free from the problems mentioned above. Moreover, the proposed analytical approach is closer to the theoretical concept of electoral volatility than traditional approaches. Analyses shed new light on the phenomenon of electoral volatility in Poland and provide insights for studying volatility in other political contexts.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0261	21	Polling Station Size and Electoral Outcomes	The cost of voting is higher for socially and economically disadvantaged communities. We know that their crowded polling stations have longer lines, and those who vote at such stations once are less likely to vote again in the future. However, we do not know whether the implied effect of station size is causal. With an instrumental variables approach to discontinuities in station size in Turkey, this study provides the strongest causal evidence yet: station size decreases not only voter turnout but incumbent vote share. If incumbents are punished for crowded stations in the same election, then there would be strong incentives for governments to distribute the resources for electoral management more equally, increasing the participation of the disadvantaged communities in elections.

2021	0227	124	The Advantage of Incumbents in Coalitional Bargaining	In parliamentary systems, the executive branch of government is not directly elected by the electorate. Instead, the executive is typically selected by a group of elected representatives. In line with Gamson's prominent hypothesis, empirical studies have documented a strong association between parties' contribution to the governing coalition and the share of executive leadership positions that they get. Yet, there rarely is an exact one-to-one mapping from parties' electoral performance to their representation in the executive branch of government. Formal theories of bargaining applied to political coalition formation often attribute this to the so-called formateur advantage, but this idea does not have strong support in data. We propose that parties' coalitional bargaining outcomes may depend not only on their seat shares but also on what kind of representatives they have. In particular, we argue that there is an incumbency bias in coalition formation. To evaluate this argument empirically, we construct a data set of political parties and governing coalitions in Finnish local governments. Using an instrumental variable strategy that hinges on within-party close elections between incumbents and non-incumbents, we find that, ceteris paribus, having more re-elected incumbents improves a party's coalitional bargaining outcomes. Incumbent representation is particularly useful when a party is in a disadvantaged position (e.g., ideologically distant from other parties) and when the bargaining environment is more complex (e.g., there are more parties). Incumbent representation also matters for political selection. Parties that have more re-elected incumbent representatives nominate more incumbents in the municipal executive.

2021	0206	502	Higher Quality Candidates Enjoying Larger Incumbency Advantage: Testing Incumbency Advantage Heterogeneity by Differences in Party Support	By building a simple model I show that Regression Discontinuity Design estimates of incumbency advantage should be negatively correlated with partisan support in an election district if higher quality candidates are more able to take advantage of the office in terms of future election prospects. This negative relationship between incumbency advantage estimates and past party performance holds empirically in 11 out of 14 single member district election offices from 10 different countries. The RDD estimate of party incumbency advantage is higher in samples restricted to constituencies where a party had a negative winning margin in previous election and lower in constituencies where winning margin was positive. In order to show that this is not driven by period specific shocks, different measures of past party performance are used. In addition to that an open party list setting is exploited in order to have a quasi-random variation for candidate quality composition of the RDD samples. If a party wins more seats in an election constituency it has marginal candidates lower on the party list (i.e. lower quality marginal candidates) compared to marginal candidates where the party won fewer seats (i.e. marginal candidates are higher on the list and thus of a higher quality). Using Norwegian municipality election data negative relationship between number of seats party list gained and incumbency advantage is shown as predicted by the theory. Moreover this result holds when RDD is used to estimate the causal effect of change of number of seats to the incumbency advantage estimates.	Political Methodology

This central question in the study of democratic policymaking has taken on urgent importance this year as governments around the world have taken varied—and in some cases unprecedented—actions to ensure public health during the Covid-19 pandemic. Drawing on a unique two-stage experiment embedded in a nationally representative panel survey of more than 4,000 Germans, we assess the ability of the German Constitutional Court to legitimate objectionable public health measures taken by the German government and whether that power varies according to citizens’ institutional support for the German court and the identity of the elites who proposed the public health measure. The results have important implications for our understanding of the role of courts in consolidated democracies, particularly in times of crisis.	Comparative Politics
2021	0207	354	Judicial Independence under Threat: The Appointment of Judges in Clientelistic Regimes	Does the family-name trump merit in the appointment process of judges? To ensure that applicants are selected on a merit base some countries have implemented nonpartisan selection commissions. However, especially in countries shaped by clientelism and patronage the selection of judges may still be driven by factors other than qualification. I argue that in these contexts the selection commission and the prevalent inclusion of the executive remain weak points in the appointment process. Using the case of the Philippines, I expound that the selection commission is a constant target for lobbying by influential groups in the society. Similarly, the president likely uses his remaining influence on the appointment to provide friends and elites with prestigious positions in the judicial branch. Thereby, applicants’ relationship to one of the many local influential family clans plays a major role for the prospects in the selection process. I test this argument using an original dataset on applicants at various levels of the nomination process for the position as judge at lower and mid-level courts in the Philippines between 2015 and 2019. Preliminary results provide evidence for an advantage of applicants with a relationship to a local influential family. Furthermore, the analyses show that those applicants that are less selective regarding their prospective position have a higher chance of getting appointed.	Comparative Politics
2021	0247	145	The Dark Side of the Mood. Candidate Evaluation, Voter Perceptions, and the Driving Role of (Dark) Personality Traits	Pre-existing research demonstrated that voters’ perceptions of leadership traits impact overall candidate evaluations. This literature focuses primarily on politically relevant traits: competence-related traits, or character traits associated with leadership performance. Less is known about the impact of candidates’ personality traits, and especially the “darker” ones (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy). It is yet unclear to what extent the (perceived) presence or absence of dark personality traits in candidates influence public attitudes towards them - and to what extent this effect exists above and beyond the structuring role of partisan attitudes. To answer this question, this study uses a multi-method approach combining an experimental design and a post-electoral survey on the 2020 US Presidential election. The survey data (study 1) confirms the key role of partisanship as a driver of candidate perceived personality. The experimental evidence (study 2) confirms a causal relationship between (perceived) candidate personality and subsequent evaluation: exposure to a negatively (positively) framed candidate personality reduces (increases) candidate likeability, and that effects of (perceived) presence of darker traits are larger than the effects of their (perceived) absence. Across both studies, the results confirm the relevance of dark triad personality traits for candidate favourability, and the existence of asymmetric effects for presence vs absence of dark traits.

2021	0270	469	How Healthy is our Democracy: Public Health and Political Participation	Though previous scholarship has investigated the impact of political structures on health, there has been a recent shift in focus to the impact of public health on politics. Most studies find that poor health diminishes an individual’s likelihood to vote, with less consistent findings on the relationship between health and other forms of political participation. The mechanisms underpinning these relations are unsettled, as health is considered to both, hinder and promote participation. We address this inconsistency in the literature by including a more nuanced measure of health, including physical and mental aspects. Using the Community Life Survey (CLS) we find that loneliness has a significant and negative impact on civic participation activities, that happiness is significantly and positively associated with voting, that increased anxiety tends to increase civic participation, and that feelings of worth are associated with changes in civic consultation activities. Contrary to our expectations, we also find that having long term health conditions that impact day-to-day activities does not significantly predict any civic or political participation, and that general health is a negative and significant predictor of civic activities, with no significant association with voting.

2021	0208	248	Personality and the Policy Positions of Politicians	Politicians’ support of or opposition to concrete policies is uniquely consequential for policymaking, public opinion, and a host of other societal outcomes. Explaining their policy positions is therefore a major research agenda in political science. Here, we evaluate the role of politicians' personality traits, measured with the Big Five typology, in shaping how liberal or conservative their economic and social policy positions are. While existing research establishes this link among non-elites, it is far from obvious that the same holds for politicians, who have systematically different personality profiles, and whose positions are constrained by party sorting. Using an in-person study of 895 incumbents in five countries who completed personality questionnaires and provided detailed issue positions, we find that Openness to Experience is a consistently strong and significant predictor of politicians' positions, but a null relationship for Conscientiousness. We discuss implications for the role of elites’ individual characteristics in policymaking.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0229	334	The Impact of Personality on Interest Group Ratings of U.S. Senators	In the United States, several hundred interest groups and other political organizations provide annual ratings of members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House. These ratings are meant to reflect members' support for the legislative agendas of the groups in question. With focus on the U.S. Senate, this study considers the possibility that a psychological factor--variation in the core personality traits of senators--also influences how favorably or unfavorably senators are rated. The detection of personality effects would add to the growing body of evidence regarding the tangible significance of elite personality, while also providing suggestive evidence that interest group ratings may not be entirely pristine representations of legislators' stances on the policies of relevance to the rating organizations.

2021	0284	356	Pushed and pulled: Refugee preferences regarding resettlement	Refugee populations have long been falsely blamed for the spread of political violence and turmoil. This perception of risk among host communities reinforces the relative neglect of already vulnerable refugee populations. Given these pressures, it is important to learn more about the conditions under which refugees might consider moving on from host countries and relocating elsewhere. We investigate both which factors affect whether individual refugees wish to resettle, and which factors affect to where refugees might prefer to relocate. We expect that refugees are likely to be deterred (attracted) when there is the potential for them to (not) experience abuse at the hands of local populations, when it is (not) hard for them to find work, in the absence (presence) of kin diaspora groups, and when there are (not) restrictions on legal opportunities for their arrival. We draw evidence from an original survey (N=2,000) among Syrian refugees currently hosted in Lebanon. Lebanon ranks first globally with the highest concentration of refugees to citizens: at least 1 in 6 residents there is a refugee. As part of a longer survey, we devoted a portion of questions to refugees’ preferences regarding future movements, including the possibility of relocating to a third country. Included within these questions was a conjoint experiment task in which refugees were presented with a series of paired destinations and asked to choose between them.

2021	0297	397	Long-term Change in Conflict Attitudes: A Dynamic Approach	How do real-world events in conflicts affect public attitudes about their resolution? A large and growing literature has examined the causes and mechanisms that shape public opinion in conflicts, yet it has mostly focused on short-term or static relationships, leaving open questions about their temporal dynamics. Addressing this gap, we use a unique dataset of monthly surveys conducted in Israel over two decades (2001-2020) to analyze the dynamic influence that different event types have had on aggregate attitudes among Israeli Jews. While we corroborate past findings about the negative influence of violence on popular support and hope for a resolution, we also find that these effects are short-lived and do not leave a lasting mark on public attitudes. By contrast, non-violent events that send negative signals about the possibility of peace, such as failed negotiations and popular support for extremists on the other side, exert a deeper and lengthier negative influence on the long-term trajectory of public opinion. These patterns are consistent with two parallel mechanisms: an immediate but short-lived emotional response to palpable threats and slower but longer-lasting information updating. These findings shed new light on the dynamic nature of public attitudes in conflicts and underscore the importance of non-violent signals in advancing their resolution.

2021	0310	169	Oiling the Guns: How FDI in Oil and Gas Extraction Affects Conflict Dynamics	Countries rich in gas and oil tend to see disproportionately long conflicts (e.g. Nigeria). Despite the violence, they receive vast inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into gas and oil extraction. We argue that the presence of FDI is crucial in explaining conflict duration. Combining sub-national, geo-referenced data on FDI and armed conflict in African countries, we demonstrate that inward FDI in oil and gas prolongs conflict at the national level and leads to a displacement of violence at the local level. Governments are keen on maintaining FDI and hence send their troops to secure resource infrastructure, diverting them from the front. This facilitates the entrenchment of rebel groups. Meanwhile, resource wealth further raises the relative capacity of the state and therefore diminishes incentives to reach a negotiated settlement. To address endogeneity concerns, we compare conflict dynamics between districts that have experienced oil or gas FDI by 2010 to areas that will experience it between 2010 and 2018. To illuminate the mechanisms, we examine the case of Mozambique and demonstrate how FDI altered the government's counter insurgency strategy.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0322	316	Water conflict: An Empirical Test for Neo-Malthusian View with Remotely-Sensed Data	This study aims using remotely sensed data to calculate the area of agricultural land for each country within specific international river basins over space and time, and empirically investigates the impact of agriculture on conflict over international rivers from 2001 to 2007. Water is an essential resource for human existence and is used to fuel all facets of human life. Neo-Malthusians thus argue that inequal access to scarce and critical resources such as water will stoke grievances among disenfranchised water users, which in turn triggers conflicts over them. Irrigation for agriculture makes the most demands on freshwater supplies, far more than industries’ water use and individuals’ water consumption. For a country heavily dependent on international water river for its agricultural irrigation, the danger of having its water supply severely constrained by the other country along the same river may seem highly threatening. Unfortunately, due to lack of data on agriculture land for each country in specific international river basins, there are no directly convincing evidence for neo-Malthusian view of water conflict regarding on the impact of agriculture. This study aims to fill this gap by using remotely sensed data, and empirically examines the impact of agriculture on conflict over international rivers from 2001-2007. We will calculate the area of agricultural land for each country within specific international river basins based on Modis Land Cover Data (500m). The data on water conflict will be from the International Water Cooperation and Conflict Database, which records water events from 2001 to 2007.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0271	74	Resolved or belligerent: crisis signaling without inherent assurances	In the standard game of interstate crises, a nation targeted for coercive threats concedes or resists being unsure of how credible initiator’s threats to attack if resisted are while fully trusting the initiator’s assurances of not attacking after a concession. In actual crises, however, such inherently credible assurances don’t exist, for a coercer with ulterior motive might issue a deceptive offer to make a target concede and demobilize, then exploit it. In the 1950 Sino-American crisis during the Korean War, Mao refused to concede the control over the peninsula to America despite Truman's credible threats to attack China if it intervened. The rationale behind his resistance was his fear of Truman's belligerence to invade China after seizing the peninsula. Modeling crisis signaling under lack of inherent assurances, this paper shows the credibility of assurances not only affects the outcome of the game but alters how costly threats work within it. I found lack of assurances doesn't impede coercion only when it's minor. Further, under the lack of assurances larger military mobilization while always raises the success rate of coercion in the standard setting, can preclude coercion success by rendering assurances noncredible. Besides, by lettting a coercer simultaneously implement both verbal threats and military mobilization, my model enables us to study the interaction between the two signals. Verbal threats, though less costly hence less effective in the standard game, exert its relative advantage by precisely conveying resolve while denying belligerence, thereby assuaging the risk of escalation caused by tacit mobilization.

2021	0298	403	Natural disasters and Green party support	Do natural disasters help Green parties? It is often argued that climate change will increase the number and frequency of natural disasters, and therefore to understand its political consequences becomes particularly relevant. Recent research has shown that to experience natural disasters makes voters more likely to vote progressively on referenda on the environment. In addition, there is a large body of literature on the consequences of natural disasters, showing that incumbents can be punished, and that to experience natural disasters makes voters more aware and progressive on the environment. I argue that combination of these two patterns provides Green parties with a unique electoral opportunity, by putting an issue they tend to own on the agenda and by creating an incentive for protest voting. By compiling a novel dataset combining flood registers and local electoral results from multiple sources, I test this argument by leveraging on the differential exposure to floods in the UK and conduct a difference-in-differences design to identify the impact of experiencing floods on the electoral performance of Green parties. I explore the mechanisms underlying my findings by analyzing geo-located panel surveys, recycling data, as well as local party communications and candidate allocation. This paper thus contributes to a better understanding of the politics of climate change and how the behavior of different political actors is shaped by it.

2021	0272	105	EMOTIONS AND PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES	Climate change is a problem that requires widespread public support for various policies. Emotional framing of climate change-related issues may increase concern with climate change and increase support for individual and collective actions aimed at adapting to or mitigating the effects of climate change. However, not much research has looked into whether different emotional frames also influence support for specific policies aimed to address climate change. Drawing on functional emotion theory, which suggests that the appraisal of (discrete) emotions differentially affect perceptions and judgments, we hypothesize on the effects of three discrete emotions on support for different types of policy proposals. First, we predict that emotional framing of climate change that elicits anger in respondents will be associated with greater levels of support for policies that involve high levels of civil penalties imposed on firms or organizations that breach laws and regulations. Next, expect fear frames to promote greater levels of support for protective policies that aim to adapt to climate change. Third, we hypothesize that emotional frames that elicit guilt will be associated with greater levels of support for climate change policies that involve high costs to individuals and the society. Fourth, we also predict that fear and anger will make individuals focus on short-term solutions, whereas guilt will be associated with support for long-term policies, such as disaster preparedness. We test our hypotheses using data from a survey experiment conducted in the United Kingdom in which we used media frames that aroused anger, fear, and guilt as treatments.	Political Communications
2021	0323	653	The Importance of Distributional Implications for Climate Policy Change	Nation states need to address global climate change with ever increasing levels of stringency, as scientific evidence available suggests that efforts implemented so far will massively overshot the 2° Paris Agreement scenario. A central component of the international agreement is the role of a progression of commitments and thus a strengthening of domestic policies to reach the proposed targets. More stringent climate change policies (e.g. an increase of a carbon tax) will come at a cost. A cost with respect to economic growth or international competitiveness for firms and at a cost for individuals resulting from higher expenditures for heating, mobility or housing. The yellow vest protest in France prominently figure as an example on how more stringent policies and their distributive consequences may lead to increased politicization of the climate issue and even outright protest. I use the recent complete revision of the Swiss CO2 law (the main climate policy instrument in Switzerland) as an example of a change towards a more ambitious climate policy and experimentally test whether and which distributional implications of the policy change matter in people's consideration of supporting or opposing the revision. Moreover, people were asked about their preferences in compensating losers of the reform. Preliminary results suggest that people generally react very negatively to information on distributional implications and that preferences regarding compensation vary widely and line up well with partisanship.

2021	0285	308	Carbon Inequality and Support for Carbon Pricing	Stringent policies that significantly increase the cost of greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, are increasingly necessary for mitigating climate change. Yet while richer individuals in society generate the most CO2 emissions, and thus will face the largest cost burden, they also tend to be more supportive of stringent environmental policies. This paper argues that these opposite trends occur due to variation in individuals' beliefs about the distribution of CO2 emissions and the size of their own emissions relative to others within their country. Utilising survey experiments in Germany, we examine how information on the distribution of CO2 emissions by income groups affect environmental policy preferencess. Specifically, we examine how information about individuals' household emissions relative to the average level of emissions and/or the top and bottom 20% of emissions in the country affect individuals' support for increasing the cost of emissions through carbon pricing. In doing so, we are able to better understand how the emerging distributional costs of tackling climate change affect public support and political feasibility.

2021	0311	285	A comparative analysis of the relationship between politics and civic education	In this study, we carry out an empirical comparative analysis of the relationship between a political institution and civic education. The study of education in political science has witnessed the emergence of various studies in recent years, particularly, those focusing on education spending and vocational education. Unfortunately, there remains a knowledge gap regarding how politics impact education for democracy, which is of crucial importance for future democracies. The DPI (Database of Political Institutions) 2017 & ICCS (International Civic and Citizenship Study of Education) 2016 datasets were used for the comparative analysis. Past studies have adequately brought out the importance of class climate in civic education. For instance, mutual respect between classmates and the openness to engage in discussions with differing views can increase students’ political participation in the future. While previous studies have focused on how the levels of the school, teacher, and individual factors have affected classroom climate, the effects of political factors are yet to be investigated. We analyze the relationship between political institutions/partisan politics and class climate by using data from about 20 countries. The findings of this study suggest that governments with greater concentrated power are more likely to offer a restrained classroom climate. Furthermore, classroom climate, considered most important for civic education, is impacted not only at the levels of the school and teacher but also at the levels of the political system and partisan politics.

2021	0312	534	War from afar: military automation and conflict	How does military automation that replaces soldiers with machines affect the frequency and intensity of conflicts? I argue and demonstrate empirically that despite lowering the cost of fighting, military automation does not necessarily make states pull the trigger in every dispute. Rather it has a stronger effect on those conflicts that involve decision-makers' key interests, that is conflicts that would have taken place also in the absence of military automation. The empirical analysis utilizes a novel detailed time-series cross-sectional dataset of various military indicators from over 170 countries over a period of 2000-2020. The quantitative empirical analysis uses diverse measurements of conflict to examine in details the connection between military automation and conflict. The findings suggest that military automation--operationalized as possession of different types of drones--increases involvement in conflicts primarily against opponents that do not possess such capabilities. In addition, there is no increase in new conflicts, but rather escalation of and additional rounds of already existing disputes. These findings shed new light on the debate between `military automation alarmists' and `military automation skeptics'. The former believe that automation induces moral hazard and makes conflicts more likely, whereas the latter dismiss the importance of automation to conflict due to technical limitations and possible ways to neutralize automated systems. The results here suggest that moral hazard is quite limited, but at the same time it affects already existing conflicts in which only one of the belligerents has such capabilities.

2021	0299	191	Re-assessing the link between multinational corporations and conflicts: evidence from geo-referenced data	So far, the effect of multinational corporations on political stability in a host country is ambiguous. While their exploitation of resources and labour force in the primary sector is theorized to exacerbate grievances and greed among the population, recent research suggests a conflict-reducing effect of foreign companies in the service sector. Prior empirical analyses either examine the role of foreign firms at the country-year level or focus on indicators of political instability separately. Yet, as both economic activities and incidents of political instability tend to be regionally clustered, an analysis at the macro-level may not adequately capture the relationship. In our paper, we contribute to this debate by linking geographically referenced data on affiliates of multinational corporations from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey with geo-referenced event data on various types of social and armed conflict. Constructing a novel geo-coded data set for developing countries in Africa and Latin America from 2000 to 2016, our paper is the first to assess spatial dynamics of sector-specific economic activities on protest, riots, and violent conflict. In order to explore causal mechanisms, we control for firm-level characteristics and other regional information such as ethnic power relations. The analysis also accounts for reverse causality as prior research argues that political instability adversely affects the investment decision of foreign investors. Our findings provide more refined insights on whether international economic cooperations promote or deteriorate political stability abroad.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0324	446	Click, click boom: Using Wikipedia metadata to predict changes in battle-related deaths	Data and methods development are key to improve our ability to forecast conflict. Relatively new data sources such as mobile phone and social media data or images have received widespread attention in conflict research recently. Such data do oftentimes not cover substantial parts of the globe or they are difficult to obtain and manipulate which makes regular updating challenging. These sometimes vast amounts of data can also be computationally and financially costly. The data source we propose instead is cheap, readily and openly available, updated in real-time, and it provides global coverage: Wikipedia. We argue that the number of country page views can be regarded as a measure of increased interest or salience whereas the number of page changes can be regarded as a measure of controversy between competing political views. We expect these predictors to be particularly successful in capturing tensions before a conflict escalates or after a period of peace is followed by violence again, for instance electoral violence. Predicting fatalities after calm periods is particularly challenging as past violence is not a suitable predictor. We test our argument by predicting changes in battle-related deaths in Africa on the country-month level. We find evidence that country page views do increase predictive performance while page changes do not. Contrary to our expectation, our model seems to capture long-term trends better than sharp short-term changes.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0273	280	Intended and Unintended Consequences of International Interventions: Patterns of Militant Violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo	Mediation, peacekeeping, and sanctions – the international community has tried various intervention methods to reduce conflicts around the world. This paper examines the humanitarian consequences of international efforts with a focus on the fluctuation of militant violence against civilians. We argue that external interventions in internal conflicts alter political, military, and economic balance among militant groups, creating both intended and unintended consequences depending on the militant characteristics such as adaptability, co-optation and rivalry. By altering political balance among militant groups, non-inclusive mediation increases the violence of excluded militant group, while decreasing the violence of included militant group. By altering military balance among militant groups and creating a security vacuum in one area, forceful peacekeeping might reduce the violence of the targeted group, but at the same time, might increase the violence of the rival group that has been co-opted with host government forces. By altering economic balance and hurting one group more than others economically, sanctions might decrease the violence of the non-adaptable militant group that fail to adjust, but inadvertently increase the violence of adaptable groups that can easily shift their resource bases to other lucrative sources. We test these arguments using the interrupted time-series intervention analysis in the context of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the longest running civil wars featuring multiple militant groups. Our findings about the differential impacts of intervention measures on diverse set of militant groups have implications for external intervention in internal conflicts.

However, trade also enriches and empowers states, rendering them more capable of enforcing long-term settlements. Given economic disruption does not last forever, countries can be incentivized to trade short-term economic losses for long-term political or territorial gains. This trade-off can restrict or even reverse the pacifying effect of commerce as it renders states incapable of committing to existing peaceful deals. I argue the scope condition hinges on the security externalities of trade, defined as states' (latent) abilities to translate trade gains into military power. When a country's trade externality relative to her opponent's is at the extremes, more bilateral trade can be peace-promoting. However, when the relative externality is in a mid-range, increasing bilateral trade can exacerbate commitment problems leading to a higher likelihood of costly conflict. I test the implications on a sample of countries comprising strategic rivals and major powers, finding supporting results.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0313	375	Does Tax Competition Undermine Support for Redistribution?	A large body of research has focused on the nexus of globalization and the welfare state, arguing that tax competition forces policy makers to engage in largescale reforms to reduce public spending. While some scholars have argued that retrenchment is widely unpopular, recent contributions have suggested that voters support such policies under specific circumstances. I add to this literature by arguing that voters are, similar to elected officials, aware of constrains that tax competition imposes on domestic policy making and reduce support policies with progressive and expansionary character accordingly. Using geo-coded panel data and local-level tax rates from Switzerland, I demonstrate that increasing tax competition reduces support for progressive taxation and social spending. In addition, I show that the response to tax competition is not heterogeneous across ideological leanings, income, or adverse labor market experiences.

2021	0287	29	Self-Perceptions of Income-Ability Gap and Preferences for Redistribution	It has been found that a large fraction of people is overconfident. Such people consider their income is low compared with the self-evaluation of their ability. How does this gap affect preferences for redistribution? Theoretically, people attribute this gap to either the lack of their ability or the unfairness of the society: realizing the income-ability gap lowers both the self-perception of their ability and the trust toward the government because the gap indicates that the government has not taken appropriate actions to make the society fair. The former (resp. the latter) is expected to increase (resp. decrease) the support for redistribution. Although recent two studies examine the effect of overconfidence on social preferences in laboratory experiments (Deffains et al. 2016, Ng and Semenov 2019), their focus is on neither updating about the ability nor political trust. After developing the formal theory of these two distinctive effects, we conduct a survey experiment in the U.S. with roughly 2000 participants. At the beginning of the survey, respondents are asked to tell their income and self-evaluation on their ability, which give us their self-perception of income-ability gap. Then, respondents are randomly assigned to the treatment that emphasizes the income-ability gap constructed by their previous answers. By looking at the treatment effect on the perceived degree of ability, the trust toward the US government, and the preferences for redistribution, we uncover how realizing the income-ability gap changes the preferences for redistribution.

2021	0300	176	Does income transparency affect support for redistribution? Evidence from Finland’s Tax Day	The disconnect between rising inequality and lack of support for redistribution in Western democracies raises the question of whether specific policy interventions can shift demand for redistribution. This paper examines whether income transparency - the public release of citizens' income information - affects support for redistribution. We take advantage of a quasi-experiment in Finland, where every year on the so-called 'tax day', the authorities release income information on Finland's top-earners to the public. To identify the causal effect of the tax day we compare respondents who took part in the European Social Survey shorty before and after the event. We find that the tax day increases income comparisons and perceptions that earnings of the top 10% are unfair, but that public support for redistribution remains largely unaffected. A notable exception are top-earners (who are the focus of the tax day) and young people (who adjust their perceived income status more than other age groups). Our results highlight the scope conditions of previous survey- and field experiments, and suggest that increasing exposure to inequality through a real-world policy (rather than experimental treatments) may trigger only marginal changes in support for redistribution.

2021	0274	192	Gender Gaps in Preferences for Social Spending and Redistribution: A Comparative Analysis of Welfare Systems	Women have been found to be more supportive of redistribution and social spending across established, Western, democracies. The size of these gender gaps varies across time and space, and yet, the comparative literature on attitudinal gender gaps has largely neglected the role of the political and policy context when it comes to accounting for this variation. In this paper, we test the role of welfare systems in creating or suppressing gender differences in attitudes towards redistribution and social spending. Welfare systems should be relevant for the size of attitudinal gender gaps because women’s greater preference for social spending and redistribution is linked to their greater use of welfare services, and so the extent to which these are currently provided should affect demand in a gendered way. Using survey data from the International Social Survey Programme 1985-2016 across European and Anglo-American democracies, we examine whether the welfare regime, spending in different policy areas, and the degree of maternity and childcare-related rights are associated with the size and direction of these attitudinal gender gaps. The extent to which the policy context matters for attitudinal gender gaps has implications for both preferences for state action in the population as well as for the types of gender vote gaps that we might expect to see across different welfare systems.

2021	0275	483	A loyal base? Support for authoritarian regimes in times of crisis – The case of Turkey	Do citizens support authoritarian regimes and if yes, is this support sincere or conditional on the regime’s performance? Does this support help regimes to survive national crises? Despite the potentially important role of citizens to stabilize regimes, to this point, relatively little is known about the various attitudes that motivate citizens to cooperate with the state in autocracies. Building on the work of Easton (1965), we propose a unified research framework that conceptualizes the complex relationship between autocrats and their subjects. Our framework proposes a dual distinction between conditional (specific) and sincere (diffuse) support for the ruling regime. We expect that in times of (political or economic) crisis, the loyalty of sincere supporters remains unwavering, ensuring the resilience of the regime. However, regimes might be challenged by conditional supporters during crises once they lose their grip on economic performance or signalling political competence. We test our conceptual framework of citizen’s support for autocracies using Turkey as a case study. Firstly, we use existing longitudinal data during the 2016 political and 2018 economic crises, modelling support for the regime parties as a function of proxies for sincere and conditional support over time. Secondly, to increase the internal validity of our findings, we field several original experiments (list as well as framing experiments), recruiting Turkish participants from Facebook and Instagram using online advertisement. Our results demonstrate the greater durability of sincere support compared to conditional support in times of crisis.	Comparative Politics
2021	0301	87	Keeping Up With the Kims: A Social Network Analysis of the Effects of Purges in North Korea	How do elite purges affect the composition of ruling coalitions in dictatorships? Two arguments have been advanced for the individual-level effects of purges on elite networks in dictatorships. First, purges may cause acquaintances to also suffer as dictators remove entire sub-networks within ruling coalitions. Second, purges may provide opportunities for other elites to improve their position. We examine these arguments on the case of North Korea. Recent scholarship has shown that politics in North Korea more closely resembles other dictatorships than previously thought. We build on this work, using social network analysis to explore the micro effects of elite purges in dictatorships by analyzing an original dataset of thousands of leadership events in North Korea between 1994 and 2020. The project has implications for theory on authoritarian survival, as well as for policymakers who must closely follow events in dictatorships to inform foreign policy.	Comparative Politics
2021	0314	62	Loyalty or Expertise - What Does an Authoritarian Regime Value in Consultations?	Authoritarian regimes suffer from inherent information asymmetry problems. Prior research has shown how dictators have created different channels including formal institutions that mitigate the problem of information collection. However, less attention has been paid to what kind of information authoritarian regimes value and act upon. In particular, it remains unexplored whether regimes value good information or demonstrations of loyalty. Anecdotal evidence, for instance, from the famine in China between 1958 and 1961 suggests that authoritarian regimes are unable to process information accurately. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes often justify the creation of consultative mechanisms as efforts to rationalize policymaking. Drawing on an original dataset of proposals and government responses to a Provincial People’s Political Consultative Conference (PPCC) in China, this paper analyzes precisely how the authoritarian government reacts to different kinds of information that it receives. In particular, it is assessing whether high-quality information will be appreciated more by government agencies or whether the identity of the proposer is more decisive in determining the governments’ responses.

2021	0288	48	Agents of State Control? Neighbourhood Organisations and Authoritarian Rule	Key to authoritarian politics is maintaining social control over the masses. To this end the ruling regime may employ a variety of instruments, from controlled legislatures to the secret police, to effect compliance and surveillance. However, most instruments studied so far do not reach or cover the grassroots level sufficiently, leaving open the question of authoritarian control on the ground. In this paper we propose a largely overlooked type of instruments, neighbourhood organisations (NO), to partly fulfil the gap. Nominally resident-led but actually state-controlled, these organisations can perform the key control tasks of policy enforcement and information gathering for the regime in urban neighbourhoods. Specifically, we identify the main factors for such functions as their dual characters of local embeddedness and state dependency. Using an original 11-year panel from 31 Chinese regions, we show with mixed beta models a robust positive association between regime domestic security concerns and neighbourhood organisation staff coverage. Drawing on present and related evidence, we argue that these organisations can strengthen the autocrat’s control over local society and consolidate its rule. We duly call for greater attention to the local level of politics in authoritarian studies.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0289	540	Christian Missionaries and Social Protection in Colonial Africa	Christian missionaries were often the first to provide social protection to local populations in colonies. Hoping to attract new converts, missionaries frequently build schools and operated medical stations. Colonial administrations often welcomed and supported these activities as they had to balance their strained budgets. In this paper, we argue that administrations did not treat all missionaries equally, generally preferring to cooperate with missionaries from their own metropole. To support our argument we use new historical data from the interwar period in Africa and demonstrate that aligned missions achieved better educational and health outputs than their non-aligned counterparts. We explore potential channels underlying this dynamic, including financial support to missions as well as the granting of access to more favorable locations. Our findings have important implications for the existing scholarship which so far has focussed on confessional differences rather than in national origins. Furthermore, most earlier studies only show effects on long-term outcomes, while our new data allows us to focus on the early provision of social protection and thus to close an important link in the causal chain.

2021	0276	495	A Tale of Two Thousand Cities: A Comparative Analysis of Political and Economic Dynamics in Western Eurasia	This article documents several key patterns in political and economic development in Europe and the Middle East from the beginning of the Late Medieval period up until the eve of the Industrial Revolution. Specifically, I present quantitative measurements of several salient characteristics of pre-modern states and analyze the political economy of historical political units, from tiny city-states to vast empires. Importantly, I go beyond the level of contemporary states and, accordingly, analyze and describe the geographic extent, economic development, political centralization, and internal dynamics of polities at the polity level. Combining a long range of statistical sources into a novel data set on historical political units, I trace the politico-economic history of Western Eurasia in the 800-year period associated with the formation of the European state system as well as the onset of the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. Additionally, I put forward statistical evidence of key critical junctures and of both convergences and divergences within the greater Western Eurasian region.	Comparative Politics
2021	0325	75	Economic Shocks, Mobilization, and Elite Fragmentation: The Origins of Regional Elites’ Split	What are the origins of elite fragmentation? Why and when do regional elites split from central elites to create regionally-oriented political parties? Economic geographic divides affect elite’s distribution of political preferences. Nonetheless, other factors beyond economic characteristics, such as mobilization capacities, are also relevant to understand the origins of elite conflicts. This paper contends that intra-elite differences are more likely to be politicized when an economic shock exacerbates preexisting center-periphery intra-elite conflicts and regional elites have mobilization capacities. Elites both affected by asymmetric economic shocks and able to mobilize the electorate will engage in a process of elite fragmentation. I employ district-level electoral, economic, and sociodemographic data in Catalonia during the period 1900–1923 to test when do regional elites seek for an autonomous political path. The results show that elite fragmentation took place in areas more affected by the 1898 colonial economic shock and where electoral mobilization capacities of the elite were larger. In those districts where elites commanded mobilization of voters, the economic effects of the colonial loss were accentuated and elites were more prone to support the regional elite new political party.

2021	0302	51	Critical Junctures and Public Health Policy: A Study of Nazi Germany and the United States	How do political institutions shape the dynamics of policy change? This study traces the effects of Nazi Germany’s approach to public health on prospects for policy change in contemporary Germany. I argue that the promotion of public health policies by the Third Reich led to a backlash against government intervention on these issues after the collapse of the Nazi regime. As a result of this backlash, the post-war German government developed a decentralized and fragmented approach to public health that has slowed the pace of policy change in this domain into the contemporary period. A historical institutionalist lens and process tracing are utilized to support this argument. As evidence, it leverages more than 80 semi-structured elite interviews with public health professionals and political actors in Germany, original public opinion data, and analysis of the organizational structure of public health policymaking in all levels of government. In addition to evaluating these policies in general, the paper traces the progression of tobacco policy to demonstrate how backlash to Nazism and subsequent institutional structures slowed Germany’s ability to reduce tobacco consumption among the public. Comparisons with public health policymaking in the United States is used to strengthen the argument. The paper illustrates how critical junctures within a given policy domain can have lasting effects on the state’s ability to implement policy change effectively.	Comparative Politics
2021	0315	60	Waves of Empowerment: Black Radio and the Civil Rights Movement	In the early 1960s, as the civil rights movement was gaining momentum, Black-oriented radio stations were broadcasting across large swaths of the American South. This paper uses newly digitized data to provide the first empirical evidence on the effects of Black radio on the American civil rights movement. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in signal reception resulting from topographic factors, I find strong evidence that Black radio increased Black political participation and activism in the South during the early 1960s, as measured by Black voter registration and the presence of a local chapter of the NAACP. For mechanisms, I find evidence consistent with Black radio increasing the reach of civil rights groups and providing positive role models to African Americans. Moreover, results suggest that exposure to Black radio translated into substantive economic and political gains for the Black community in the form of greater state aid and legislative support for civil rights bills. Much of the effects of Black radio took place before the enactment of landmark civil rights legislation, highlighting the significance of Black radio to the Black community.	Political Communications
2021	0303	592	Authority Matters: Institutional Reforms, Cosmopolitanism, and the Public Legitimacy of International Organizations	Does the public legitimacy of International Organizations (IOs) depend on their institutional settings? In this paper, we seek to provide an answer to these questions by focusing on the authority dimension of an IO’s institutional design. We argue that changes to scope of IO authority on two different sub-dimensions employ effects on the IO’s public legitimacy: the bindingness of policy decision and the majority/voting rules in the IO’s governing body. More specifically, we hypothesize that the direction of effects varies between citizens with higher and lower levels of cosmopolitanism – somewhere else aptly described as, “Anywheres” and “Somewheres”. While the cosmopolitan-minded Anywheres should prefer higher levels of IO authority, the communitarian-minded Somewheres should be more favorable towards lower authority levels. We test our expectations by conducting a self-administered factorial survey experiments in six different countries. The empirical results support our arguments and imply that the effectiveness of IO reforms in regard to public legitimacy might feed into the cosmopolitan-communitarian societal cleavage.

2021	0316	140	Signalling disagreement or struggling to compromise? Analyzing abstention votes in the United Nations General Assembly.	Voting records in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) are increasingly important for analyses of international cooperation as they have become the foundation of various measures of foreign policy preference similarity of states. Many of these measurements treat abstentions as a less strong signal of disapproval than a “no” vote. Yet we are lacking a comprehensive understanding of why states abstain in the UNGA. Recent scholarship on coalition foreign policymaking suggests that coalition governments will be less prone to act in an extreme fashion because coalition parties can hold each other to account rather than having a tendency to extreme behaviour due to the ability to shift blame or be hijacked by fringe parties in government. In line with these findings, I argue that the behaviour of governments in international relations is influenced by the ideological cohesion of the government parties which may lead to an inability to compromise. I test my hypotheses utilizing data from the Manifesto Project to assess the effect of ideological cohesion of coalition governments on the United Nations General Assembly voting record of Western European Democracies. I find that, after the Cold War, coalition governments are more likely to abstain from a 'yes' or 'no' vote in the UNGA as they grow less ideologically cohesive. This finding confirms the hypothesis that the ideological preferences of cabinet parties influence the ability of governments to act on foreign policy and calls into question the predominant measurement of preference similarity of states in international relations scholarship.

2021	0290	139	UN peacekeeping contribution and status enhancement	A large literature sees status and reputation as drivers of international conflict onset, understanding status-seeking events as necessarily salient and dramatic. However, it may also be possible that status can be achieved via more quiet means such as peacekeeping. Accordingly, qualitative scholars regularly identify status and reputation as key motivations to contribute to peacekeeping missions. However, there is no systematic evidence that peacekeeping contributions really enhance a country’s status, possibly due to the difficulties associated with measuring status. In fact, countries can emulate the values and practices of the established powers and use peacekeeping as a tool to change its military status like Argentina’s deploying peacekeepers to overcome with the legacy of the military regime and gaining recognition and status (social mobility). Lower status countries can also find new value dimensions in peacekeeping like Canadaʼs wanting title of “good citizen” to increase its status (social creativity). Based on the literature’s theory of social mobility and social creativity, I propose a network theory (i.e. invitation continuation, cooperation continuation, signalling theory) that UN peacekeeping network can influence military status network. I use Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) network to measure military status network for signing an agreement shows military interaction and perceptive recognition, which echoes status. In other words, I am interested in whether peacekeeping ties can explain the formation of DCA ties and hypothesise that if a sender establishes more peacekeeping ties, the sender will also establish more DCA ties. I use (temporal) exponential random graph methods to test this network theory.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0277	578	Who Are Staffing the UN Organizations? Contributions, Connections and Ideologies.	Merit-based bureaucrats are supposed to staff the international organizations. Using official data from the UN Organizations (1996-2019), we find contradictory evidence. Our findings show that the hiring of international organizations responds to voluntary contributions from member states; with the secretary generals of the organizations having a tendency to select staff from their own countries. We also highlight the differences between the USA and China. The Chinese staff in the UN organizations primarily respond to voluntary contributions from China, whereas secretary generals whose home countries are ideologically more aligned with the USA tend to hire more staff from the USA. The effect of ideological alignment primarily works in the case of the staff from the USA.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0278	23	Accountable to whom? Representative-voter congruence on views of representation	Political parties are considered the most important actors in the accumulation or articulation of interests in the representational process and have a key function as a democratic linkage. Parliaments are, instead, the main institution in which representation takes place and where debates about (conflicting) interests happen. For this reason, analyzing the correspondence between citizens’ and elite’s opinion – i.e. their congruence – becomes dramatically relevant for the study of political representation. Agreement between political parties and citizens, or citizens and parliament, has, however, increasingly been analyzed only recently, even if their importance in the representational process is of utmost importance. Using data from the Panel of Elected Representatives and the Norwegian Citizens Panel, the present research project focuses on representatives’ views of accountability and how these attitudes relate to those of their voters. Its goal is twofold. On the one hand, changing the perspective traditionally adopted in the literature on democratic representation, it aims to focus on elected representatives’ perceptions of government accountability. On the other hand, it aims to assess the level of congruence between voters and elites on their views about government accountability considered in its double essence (i.e. prospective vs. retrospective).

2021	0304	332	Parliament without Accountability? Electoral Party Platforms and Intra-Faction Coherence in the European Parliament	Can members of the European Parliament (EP) be held accountable under the EP's current electoral system? A working accountability-control relationship between members of parliament and voters predisposes a reasonable degree of awareness about voting patterns in parliament as well as how these patterns relate to the policy preferences parties communicate to the electorate. In the EP case, this relationship is significantly more complex than in the context of national elections. This is because European elections are not a single election, but the sum of separated elections taking place simultaneously in each member state. Hence, MEPs face a trade-off between sticking to their campaign promises and responding to the position of their European Parliament Group (EPG). This paper analyses the relationship between the cohesion of EPGs and the policy platforms (manifestos) published prior to European elections by the national parties that form EPGs. Given the relatively low level of public attention paid to how winning coalitions in the EP form in individual votes, EPGs could under certain circumstances be incentivised to use the policy platforms of their constitutive parties to signal to the latter ones' constituencies. We posit that more diverse party manifesto positions generally result in reduced cohesion of MEP votes within European party groups. We explore this and other hypotheses via quantitative analysis combining data from the EP voting record and the Euro-Manifesto project. We also consider changes in policy platforms of individual parties that are induced by adopting new platforms during a campaign for elections on national level.	EU Politics
2021	0291	71	Turnover: How electoral accountability disrupts the bureaucracy and service delivery	Electoral accountability is fundamental to representative democracy. Yet, it can also be costly for governance because it causes turnover among bureaucrats (not just elected officials) and disruptions in the delivery of public services. This paper advances a theory of political turnover as a process that, starting the moment election results are published, leads to bureaucratic shuffles and depresses service delivery. I demonstrate these turnover dynamics through a close-races regression discontinuity design, using administrative data on public employment and on healthcare service delivery in Brazilian municipalities. The results show that an electoral defeat of the incumbent causes increases in dismissals, hires, and resignations of bureaucrats, and declines in public service delivery in the months following the election. These findings draw attention to the political strategies of lame-duck politicians, and highlight the intense and consequential bureaucratic politics that follow elections.

2021	0317	395	Devolution in Non-Democratic Regimes: Local Efficiency and Resource Allocation in Russian Cities	Although there exists a number of studies about decentralization, it has rarely been examined in non-democracies. Local officials in non-democratic regimes are accountable upwards, to the center, and downwards, to the local population. This paper compares elected and appointed mayors in contemporary Russia. It leverages the federal regulation to phase-out local elections, which allows applying the difference-in-differences methodology. The empirical analysis is based on a new budget dataset for 463 Russia cities and over 9 millions city-level public procurement purchases. The paper focuses on three outcomes: taxation, efficiency in procurement and distribution of procurement contracts to local vs. non-local firms. Information about a future change from selection by election to the selection by appointment makes mayors spend more, tax more, be less efficient and divert more municipal contracts to non-local suppliers. These results are amplified in cases with elected governors, who are more likely to monitor mayors' behavior. Selection rule explains the heterogeneity of fiscal outcomes through differences in the local officials' incentives. Subnational elections in non-democracies incentivize local politicians to be more efficient, but mostly to preserve their positions in office.	Political Economy, Public Policy and Administration
2021	0326	367	Opposition fragmentation facilitates electoral accountability. Evidence from a survey experiment	For electoral accountability to be effective, what is better: a fragmented opposition that gives plenty of alternatives or an opposition with fewer stronger parties? While oppositions play a key role in democracies, the effect of their fragmentation on accountability remains unclear. On the one hand, the more the opposition parties the easier for voters to find ideologically close alternatives. On the other hand, high levels of fragmentation can also make accountability more difficult because in these contexts voters may struggle to find and coordinate over viable alternatives. Thus, fragmentation of oppositions generates two opposite effects that have arguably led to inconclusive empirical results so far. To solve this puzzle I first analyze whether the effect of oppositions’ fragmentation on accountability may follow a non-linear pattern, that is, whether fragmentation may initially foster accountability while making it more demanding when many alternatives exist. Moreover, I distinguish between ideologues and pragmatic voters and differentiate ideological and valence issues to assess the specific conditions under which fragmentation may enhance accountability. I test these hypotheses using a survey experiment. In the experiment, voters were presented with a case of a government accused of corruption, and were asked to express their willingness to support or punish it. I randomly manipulated the framing of the scandal and the degree of opposition fragmentation. The results show that fragmentation clearly enhances accountability and that this effect is significantly larger for ideological voters.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0279	527	Identity Formation between Structure and Agency – How 'Us' and 'Them' Relates to Voting Behavior in Contexts of Electoral Realignment	Western Europe is experiencing growing levels of political polarization between parties of the New Left and the Far Right. In many countries, the socio-structural foundations of this divide (class, education, residency) are by now so clear that many interpret this divide as a fully mobilized new electoral cleavage. However, cleavage formation also crucially requires processes of social closure and collective identity-formation: shared group identities are the “glue” of cleavage formation, as they translate grievances into political antagonisms. This translation is far from straightforward, as it depends on both bottom-up and top-down driven processes of group boundary-drawing. Our contribution relies on data from an original online survey fielded in the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland. Respondents have answered questions on their sense of belonging to a series of social groups, electoral preferences and socio-demographics. On this basis, we are able to show – observationally – how structural differences relate to both socio-economically (e.g. class, income) and socio-culturally (e.g. cosmopolitanism, lifestyle) connoted group identities, which divide New Left and Far Right voters. Our findings so far suggest that even though the new conflict is firmly rooted in socio-economic categories, it has predominantly been mobilized in terms of culturally connoted identities. In addition, both cross-national comparison (between early “realigners” France and Switzerland vs. recent “realigners” UK and Germany), as well as experimental priming treatments on the relative saliency of key issues allow us evaluating the extent to which group identities are being shaped by experiences of social closure (structure) and elite messages (agency).

2021	0292	650	Social distanc(ing): Identity, perceived reality and policy preferences under pandemic threat	Extreme crises hold the potential to unite societies, but also to deepen sociopolitical divisions. The ability of societies to walk in one track rather than the other depends on political leadership, pre-crisis relations between groups, and on the behavior – real and perceived – of these groups during the crisis. This paper asks whether and how does social identity effect the perception of reality under a common threat. We utilize the fact that the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit Israel’s regions and social groups unevenly, and thus created differences in groups’ morbidity rates – for studying ingroup and outgroup morbidity perceptions. We find that minority groups tend to overestimate outgroup morbidity and underestimate ingroup morbidity, especially when they themselves are characterized by high morbidity rates. These estimations are debiased when people are asked to reflect on their situation. In addition, we find evidence for ingroup bias in the support for differential policy toward cities (implied groups). The importance of our findings lies in showing that perceptions of outgroup situation can reflect intergroup relations, but may also enhance further deterioration in social divide, hence should also be key for avoiding such deterioration at times of extreme crises.

2021	0318	116	Identity or policy? Exploring the effects of social group appeals on voters	One of the main aims of political parties and politicians is to obtain support for their policy positions. However, such appeals are often not solely based on dry policy statements. Instead, political elites often tie descriptions of their issue stances to appeals to social groups. These rhetorical strategies could increase support for a policy, as social identities and group attitudes shape political opinion formation and behavior. In this paper, we thus argue that the strategic addition of group appeals can help politicians and parties to increase the popularity of their policy positions. In our study, we investigate the effects of a large set of social group appeals on voters' support for policy positions. Drawing on the existing literature, we expect that the effect of social group appeals crucially depends on the sympathy respondents hold towards a specific group. Thus, respondents who hold positive attitudes towards a specific group should react more positively when a group appeals are added to policy appeals. In contrast, respondents with a negative view of a certain group should react more negatively. We test our expectations with a survey experiment that allows for an in-depth analysis of the effect of positive and negative appeals to a variety of politically relevant groups. Our results indicate that the addition of group appeals substantially influences the evaluations of voters and leads to higher polarization. The findings contribute to our understanding of the effect of social group appeals and provide important implications for political communication and representation.

2021	0305	88	Social class, ethnicity, and the relative strength of competing social identities	How strong are the links between people’s different social identities and their political identities? I use a novel measurement design to elicit the relative extent to which citizens perceive social, cultural, and economic characteristics are relevant to their own identity and to their political commonalities with others. The experiment was carried out on the pool of regular respondents of the British Elections Study (BES), weighted on several demographics to be representative of England. It consisted of presenting two profiles, randomly selected from the 2017 post-elections BES, which included several demographic attributes, and then asking respondents to choose, in terms of politics, with which of the two they perceived they had more in common. Combining the respondent’s implicit trade-off choice and her self-categorization allows me to measure the relative strength of the individual’s social identities. The study shows an important role for ethnicity, noticeably surpassing different measures of social class, as the main characteristic for perceived political commonality. Additionally, I find that the relative primacy of ethnicity is not evenly distributed in the population, but aligned with voting behaviour. Specifically, it is the relevance placed on this aspect by Conservative and Leave voters in the 2017 general elections and the 2016 EU referendum that explains its overall strength.

2021	0306	37	Populist Swing: How Italy’s politicians are exploiting inequality rhetoric in their communication strategy	Does politicizing economic inequality impact positively on parties' approval rates? Economic demand-side explanations of populism focus on economic inequality as a predictor of the recent rise of populism. However, the literature has neglected the role of the supply side's discursive strategies in shaping perceptions of inequality and consequently influencing approval rates. This paper studies the interaction of the demand and supply sides, making use of an original dataset of Facebook posts by Italian politicians. Results show that populist parties politicize different nuances of inequality. Furthermore, while established parties are increasingly more populist in their discursive strategies, conservatives have tapped into the inequality rhetoric. Last, exploiting exogenous shocks in the debate over inequality, the paper shows that talking about inequality impacts on parties' approval rates, on top of economic and political factors, depending on politicians' ideological leaning and whether they are in office or not.

2021	0280	582	The Scar Effects of Unemployment on Electoral Participation: Withdrawal and Mobilisation across European Societies	Does unemployment increase or decrease electoral participation? A considerable body of work has examined this classic question, focusing on individual and contextual unemployment. However, this literature has scarcely examined the role of past experiences of unemployment, and not yet addressed their interaction with contextual unemployment. In this paper, we extend the framework of unemployment scarring to study electoral behaviour. First, we posit that unemployment scars decrease electoral participation. Second, we formulate competing hypotheses on the macro-micro interactions between unemployment scarring and rates at the country, NUTS1 and 2 levels. We test these hypotheses relying on Rounds 4-8 (2008-2016) of the European Social Survey, for 26 countries. Results from logistic regressions with country and year FE indicate that citizens with long unemployment scars are 9% less likely to vote than the non-scarred. We further find that higher unemployment rates at the sub-national levels slightly increase turnout, while there is no significant effect at the country level. For the same levels, we find that lower unemployment rates exacerbate the individual scarring effect on turnout up to 13%. These findings remark how the framework of the scar effects of unemployment can shed further light on the relationship between social stratification and political behaviour.

2021	0327	542	Explaining the politicization of EU: Parties and media agendas across time and space	The EU has become more salient on the agenda of both media and parties as the integration process has developed towards more integration. However, there is a large variance within this trend. A patchwork of politicizing moments has happened whenever a critical or exceptional moment hits, directly or indirectly, the institution. Additionally, this literature has also been inquiring into the polarization of the EU on both media and parties and also on which issues were politicized at different moments. In parallel, politics has become increasingly mediatized with media being the most important source of information and communication between governors and the governed. Despite this intricate connection, parties and media have different underlying motivations that impact not only on the contents that both arenas focus on but also on the way they do so. These distinct characteristics between both actors have the potential to trigger different patterns of politicization regarding salience, polarization, content (different EU issues), and format with variation across countries and over time. Past literature neglects a necessary comparison of both arenas and several aspects of EU politicization can only be understood in this way. Therefore, this paper assesses the EU politicization phenomenon on its several aspects (salience, polarization, content, and format) on both arenas (parties and media), and over time (from 2002 to 2016) in five different countries (Portugal, Spain, Germany, Ireland, and Belgium). Through the application of automated and manual content analysis realized by native speakers, both parliamentary debates and newspapers are analyzed.	EU Politics
2021	0293	177	Ambiguity as Strategy of Radical Left Party Leaders in Western Europe	Leaders of parties are often used as ideological cues by other parties, scholars and voters to understand where a party stands on a policy issue. However, some parties choose to avoid being clear on certain issues. For instance, Radical Left Parties (RLPs) have a contentious relationship with nationalist issues - strategically ambiguous positioning is prominent. Do the leaders give a clearer indication on salient and contentious issues in RLPs? This research uses the author's original dataset of RLP party congress speeches in 14 Western European countries from their earliest election in the 1980s to their latest election before 2019. Through the use of text as data, specifically Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS) and dictionary analysis, this research estimates ambiguity in speech. Further, this research classifies policy areas in order to show the issues in which ambiguity is more prominent. The research finds that there are significant differences in positional ambiguity between the leadership in comparison to less prominent members on issues such as Euroscepticism. When salience of policy issues like the EU and immigration increases, party manifestos become more ambiguous, due to enhanced intra-party heterogeneity, while party leaders do not show the same trends. The strategic ambiguity of RLP leadership varies depending on a party's position in the party system and thus differs within the RLP family. This research is a first step in the study of strategic communication in RLPs as it provides a quantitative analysis of party leadership strategy on specific issues.	Political Communications

Instead, most research concentrates on electoral pledges, issue attention, and policy positions. This lack of scholarly attention is surprising given recent evidence that voters respond to nostalgic rhetoric and may even adjust issue positions when policy is framed in nostalgic terms. Survey experiments show that a nostalgic appeal increases conservative voters’ support for liberal political positions. In this paper, we apply these findings from political psychology to party communication and party competition, and study the causes and consequences of nostalgia in elections. We present a novel textual measure of partisan nostalgia, and validate this measure with hand-coded extracts of party manifestos and political speech. We first explore the variation in policy-specific nostalgia in 1,648 party manifestos from 272 elections across 24 European democracies between 1946 and 2018. Subsequently, we investigate if changes to nostalgic language impact voter attitudes on selected policy issues. Finally, we discuss the implications of our approach to the study of political parties, party competition, and elections.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics

Results of a conjoint experiment in five countries	In July 2020, the European Council agreed on a historic €750 billion recovery plan to tackle the unprecedented public health and economic crisis following the global COVID-19 pandemic. While the leaders of some member states were concerned about moral hazard and a potential Eurosceptic backlash of their voters, we actually know little about whether European citizens support European reforms to tackle this crisis and under which conditions such joint responses are perceived as legitimate. To answer this question, we conducted a conjoint experiment on public support for European solidarity and risk-sharing in the fight against the coronavirus in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. This experiment enables us to analyse to what extent public support is sensitive to key dimensions of the Eu recovery fund, such as European debt emission and repayment mechanisms, and how support is structured within and across countries.

2021	0320	101	No more saints and sinners: Tracing German preference formation in the EU’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic	To the surprise of many, the German government in the corona crisis eventually pushed for a debt-financed EU recovery fund for the fight against the pandemic. How can we explain this impetus, especially in view of the reticent German fiscal stance in previous years and in the early stages of the pandemic? In order to trace, and explain, German preferences, this paper revisits and combines different EU theories. It shows three things: national preference formation and EU-level deliberations happened simultaneously, rather than successively, and they reinforced each other; a domestic constraining dissensus did not materialize, despite the government’s European commitments; and powerful domestic interests aligned with, rather than shaped, governmental positions. Whether German action during the corona crisis will represent a long-term change in its EU and fiscal stances largely depends on the successful implementation of the recovery fund.	EU Politics

The article explores the biases of European Economic governance in times of crises and their distributional consequences for national budget structures in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic response effort. Building on the lessons from the Great Recession and sovereign debt crisis the analysis highlights where fiscal constraints hit at home during times economic downturn within the Eurozone, identifying the policy areas that may run the risk of being left behind in the negative cycle. While the pandemic context and resulting downturn pose undoubtedly unprecedented challenges for national budgets and society, in a likewise regulatory context that has no parallel in the history of the EMU, Member States track record of fiscal choices offers some indication of the distributive budgetary consequences of Covid-19. At the same time, the novel common instruments under the framework of Next Generation EU (NGEU) orients domestic pandemic recovery efforts under the (National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) toward common policy goals. The analysis considers where the growth, social, green and digital prescriptions of NGEU fit in crisis budgetary dynamics uncovering remaining gaps and their broader societal implications. The article contributes to the literature of the EMU in times of crisis bringing some preliminary insight on the case of the Covid-19 European response in shaping and re-orienting national budgetary choices.

2021	0294	223	Do Citizens Reward Place-Based Policy? Evidence from the European Union	Governments redistribute ever larger shares of their budgets to enhance the economic performance of specific areas within their jurisdiction. Yet, there is still little evidence about one of the most fundamental questions arising from such place-based policies: Do citizens reward politicians for funding that benefits their local environment? To answer this question, I turn to the European Union. I leverage quasi-experimental data from an initiative that distributed vouchers to European municipalities to establish free and high-quality WiFI connectivity right before the European Parliament election in 2019. Moreover, I analyze geolocated data about beneficiaries of two major EU funds, European Parliament election results along with register data from polling stations, and a city-wide survey experiment in Denmark. Results show that European place-based policy can reduce eurosceptic voting but has little to no impact on turnout. The results are discussed in the light of popular claims that the EU can strengthen public support through increased spending to its regions.	EU Politics
2021	0282	528	Making the Case for Democracy: The Effects of Democratic Talk on Citizens' Support for Liberal Democracy	In light of the third wave of autocratization and wide-spread concerns about citizens turning away from democracy, we test the effectiveness of 'democratic talk' as a means of countering democratic fatigue among German citizens. Specifically, we designed and implemented a pre-registered online field experiment in collaboration with eight German federal and state representatives, representing 5 German parties (1 CDU, 3 SPD, 2 FDP, 1 Green, 1 Linke), where we invited a heterogeneous sample of German citizens recruited via quota sampling on Facebook to participate in one of 16 Zoom townhalls. The townhalls were advertised as opportunities for citizens to meet representatives and discuss with them about COVID-19. 14 townhalls involving around 250 participants took place in November and December 2020, and the remaining 2 townhalls will take place in January 2021. Each representative conducts two townhalls. We used pair-random assignment to determine whether during the townhall, the representative engages in a particular style of communication that we conceptualise as 'democratic talk', or not. Democratic talk deliberately acknowledges the existence of diverging opinions and the general legitimacy of critiques of democratic practices while actively making the case for liberal democracy and democratic processes. We test the proposition that 'democratic talk' strengthens support for liberal democracy and alleviates reservations towards democratic institutions among citizens who have grown skeptical of democracy. Attitudinal outcomes are measured via a three-wave panel survey, and behavioural outcomes are measured via e-petitions and email newsletters townhall participants can sign or subscribe to.

2021	0295	577	Representation in the Eyes of the Public as a Detriment to Support for Democracy	Alarms over the “crisis of democracy” are nothing but new. While representation is a pillar of democracy, it is still not clear how citizens perceive various dimensions of representation, how this multidimensional perception affects their support for democracy, and how this effect may tap into the crisis of democracy. Addressing these questions, we juxtapose for the first time Pitkin’s formal, descriptive, symbolic, and substantive dimensions of representation with dyadic and collective levels of representation. With this, we study how representation in the eyes of the citizens affects concrete and diffuse support for democracy. Our empirical examination utilizes INES data of the three consecutive elections held in Israel in 2019-20. Notably, we find that while citizens feel most represented on the descriptive dimension and on the dyadic level, these are not important to them nor to their support for democracy. Rather, Pitkin’s other three dimensions and the collective level are the ones that affect democratic support. Moreover, against the backdrop of personalization and populism, we find that dyadic representation exposes politicization of diffuse support for democracy, while collective representation annuls this politicization and increases concrete support for democracy. Our findings suggest that the role of representation in the crisis of democracy should be considered in light of citizens’ multidimensional perception of representation.

2021	0308	516	My History or Our History? Historical Revisionism and Entitlement to Lead: Experimental Evidence from India	How do different representations of a nation’s history affect which social groups seek out, and obtain, positions of power? Drawing on the notion that historical representations serve to define and legitimize claims to the nation, we suggest that the way history is remembered may affect the extent to which minorities are perceived as entitled to take decisions on its behalf. Specifically, we expect that exclusive historical representations will lead minorities to feel less entitled to assume positions of leadership, and will lead members of the majority to more forcefully deny them access to these positions. Historical representations that include the minority group and positively describe their contributions to the nation are expected to have the opposite effect. We test our theory through a virtual lab experiment in India, where Muslims are heavily underrepresented in political institutions and there is an active movement to minimize Muslim historical contributions. Leveraging stark differences in historical depictions across official history textbooks from different Indian states and time periods, we randomly assign participants history exercises based on either an exclusive, an inclusive, or a neutral representation of history. We subsequently assess the effect of these historical representations on participants’ willingness to act as a group representative as well as their preference ranking of their group partners as group representative. Our study contributes theoretically to our understanding of the effects of historical representations on socio-political outcomes, and offers policy-relevant insights into how inclusive historical representations may encourage the political involvement of marginalized groups.

Recent contributions have challenged the established argument that elites oppose suffrage extension if fixed assets such as land are unequally distributed. We advance research on this long-standing question by exploiting exogenous variance in land ownership to investigate the link between inequality and democratization. More specifically, we employ climate suitability for wheat production to estimate the impact of landholding inequality on local support for suffrage extension. By using outcomes for two popular votes on suffrage extension in 1875 and 1877, we find that more favorable climatic conditions for wheat production are robustly associated with higher support for suffrage extension. In addition, our analysis emphasizes the importance of social control in explaining how elites achieve their political goals.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0321	545	Why Steal from the Rich to Give to No One? Rethinking Redistribution in Unequal Countries	A central pillar of contemporary political science is the assumption that poorer voters, in a democratic setting and when given the opportunity to do so, will support punitive taxes on the wealthy to finance downwards redistribution (Meltzer and Richard 1981). This interpretation of democracy as a modern day 'Robin Hood' has proven crucial for our understanding of when, and how, transitions to democracy occur (Ansell and Samuels 2014). However, we argue that the relationship between inequality and redistributive preferences has been misunderstood. In countries where inequality is endemic, citizens will not expect redistribution to result from taxation. And why steal from the rich to help no one? We expect that citizens in unequal countries will view taxation primarily as a burden and will not express much appetite to use it as a tool for redistribution. Moreover, aversion to `soaking the rich’ will be especially high in contexts where people already feel over-taxed. We test these expectations first through conjoint experiments in Mexico City and Bogotá, Colombia. This controlled comparison allows us to compare two highly unequal contexts that share similar economic and political profiles but diverge in their levels of income tax. We then test the generalizability of our claims through a global analysis using the World Values Survey, and we find increasing taxes in highly unequal countries has a negative effect on support for redistributive taxation.

2021	0283	206	Who Gets Represented? (Un)equal Representation in the European Union	Several works have investigated unequal representation in the US and found that policy mostly responds to and is congruent with the preferences of affluent Americans. Building on this pioneering work, I investigate unequal policy representation in the European Union. Given limited public control over EU policy-making, I hypothesize that policy representation in the EU should clearly be skewed towards the preferences of groups with higher access and interest in EU politics, such as the young, people from higher social strata, or the educated. Building on a unique dataset of public opinion and policy change covering more than 200 policy issues that appeared on the EU’s agenda after Eastern enlargement, I employ a series of frequentist and Bayesian statistical tests to ascertain which social group’s preferences are best represented by EU policy-making. The results demonstrate that EU policy output is most responsive to the preferences of younger, higher educated and socially more well-off individuals. These patterns of representation are reflected in public support for the EU.	EU Politics

This paper tests an explanation that looms large in research on descriptive representation, namely, differences in nascent ambition. Are workers less likely to be personally inclined to run? In this study, we use new data from 10 surveys administered to 13,550 respondents in the Americas to conduct the first cross-national analysis of social class gaps in nascent ambition (and one of the largest studies of nascent ambition to date). Among more qualified respondents, we find little evidence of social class differences in who has thought about running for office, although we find substantial gender gaps, consistent with past research. These findings mirror research on the US and suggest that the barriers that discourage working-class citizens from holding office may be distinct from the obstacles that women face.

2021	0360	183	Does polarization moderate the electoral impact of issue positions and competence? A comparative study on the 2019 EP elections	There is ongoing debate as to whether polarization increases or decreases the impact of voters’ perceptions of parties’ competence and position on their vote choices. Polarization should lower the impact of competence-based voting and increase the impact of positions because in polarized systems parties’ positions are clearly differentiated. Yet, the findings on the moderating role of polarization have yielded mixed results. This study presents new comparative evidence from the 2019 EP elections and contributes in three ways. First, our theoretical framework incorporates both polarization of parties and voters to better understand the way in which polarization affects the importance of positions and competence on the vote. In terms of the party offer, we examine the extent to which polarization of parties’ positions on an issue affects voters’ propensity to engage in competence and spatial voting. We also propose that voters with polarized (eccentric) positions on an issue are more likely to engage in spatial voting compared to voters with moderate (centric) positions. Second, we examine the interplay between voter and party polarization. Our key expectation is that party system polarization increases the difference between moderate and polarized voters: voters with strong stances on an issue will be more inclined to engage in spatial voting compared to moderate voters, but their ability to do so is further enhanced when the party system offers more divergent choices. Third, we present rich evidence that allows us to test our expectations in 10 EU member states and for four issues.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0375	266	Biased but moderate voters: How information depolarizes political attitudes	Common predictions of motivated political reasoning assume that biased voters should polarize after exposure to mixed arguments. However, despite extensive evidence of biased information processing, evidence of attitude polarization is surprisingly rare. This study contributes to explaining this apparent puzzle by showing that Bayesian voters can simultaneously evaluate information in line with predictions of motivated reasoning and moderate pre-existing attitudes. Experimental evidence from four studies concerning highly salient political issues in the US and the UK confirms that exposure to a balanced set of arguments leads to depolarization of attitudes, despite the presence of a confirmation bias in the evaluation of evidence. Contrary to common predictions, moderation of attitudes occurs especially among those with strong prior attitudes and those with high levels of political sophistication. By showing that even biased voters can moderate their attitudes in response to evidence, this study casts a positive light on the consequences of motivated political reasoning, and indicates that information can actually smooth the extreme fringes of the electorate during intense political campaigns.

2021	0344	161	Primary Roots of Partisan Polarization: The Effects of Primaries on Intra-Campaign Positional Shifts in Congressional Elections	Whether congressional primaries are a source of polarization in the U.S. Congress remains contested. Central to claims that primaries polarize is the strategic positioning dilemma, which contends that candidates must satisfy ideologically extreme partisans in the primary before facing a comparatively moderate general electorate. We test whether candidates position themselves differently across primary and general elections using a unique dataset of positions over time. We apply an original scaling method based on candidates’ language on Twitter to estimate the positions of over 800 candidates in the 2020 primaries for the US House of Representatives and Senate over time. We show the validity of these positions by correlating them with NOMINATE (r > 0.9) where possible. We use a interrupted time series design on dynamic ideal points to show that the presence of a primary election caused artificial partisanship among Democrats. Democrats who did not become the party’s nominee moderated significantly following the primary, indicating strategic positioning for perceived electoral benefit during the nomination process. For Republicans, we observe no centrifugal effect of primaries, nor moderation among nominees or losing candidates after the nomination process.	Legislative Studies and Party Politics
2021	0328	127	Vanishing Swing Voters? On the Effect of Political Polarization on Electoral Volatility	Although previous studies provide us with important insights about the attitudinal consequences of political polarization, our understanding of its effects on electoral behavior and party competition, especially from a comparative perspective, is quite limited. This study seeks to answer a question largely overlooked in previous literature: Do high and increasing party and electoral polarization decrease electoral volatility? Coupling an original dataset with official election outcomes, this study seeks to answer whether party and electoral polarization interactively affect electoral behavior. Employing aggregated survey data on respondents' own ideological positions and their perceptions about party positions in 162 elections from 19 established democracies, the empirical analyses assess both the short- and long-term effects of party and citizen polarization on electoral volatility. The findings suggest that high and increasing party polarization decreases electoral volatility, and such effect is more pronounced when electoral polarization is also high. Distinguishing the short- and long-term effects of political polarization on voting behavior, this study concludes that polarized ideological attitudes of electorates in established democracies counterbalance the long-suggested decrease in their partisan loyalties toward mainstream parties. Political polarization has thus more important consequences for democratic theory than we often think of.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0329	412	Gender and political selection: Experimental evidence about how party leaders appoint their teams	The presence of women in positions of power is increasingly notable. Even so, the front line seems to still be monopolized by men. Much of what well-know about this issue is based on data about women's appointment to cabinets, but we still know very little about the actual decision-making processes of leaders when creating party tickets and governments. To shed light on the puzzle, I conducted a conjoint experiment in a novel survey of 979 Spanish mayors. Because mayors have the power to appoint governments, they are asked to select a team member between two randomly-varied profiles of would-be politicians. The paper also explores whether age, level of education, and having children influence team selection; as well as if male or female stereotypes (i.e., being described as competitive and self-confident, or kind and conciliatory) influence political advancement. This latter question addresses the fact that women tend to face higher development barriers in politics than men. In all, the experimental data confirms that gender, having children, and stereotypes influence teams selection. The contribution of the paper is focused on exploring if there are some patterns that define female leaders’ pathways to power. Specifically, the paper contributes to the understanding of the effects of intraparty leadership selection mechanisms, with special attention to party leaders’ motivations and incentives of appointing women on their teams.

2021	0376	371	A Booth of One’s Own: Pakistani Elections and the Effectiveness of Female-Only Polling Stations	How does gender segregation at the polling place shape political participation? Gender-specific polling stations are common in an increasing number of developing countries. While common arguments in favor of gender-segregated polling stations assert that they facilitate female electoral participation, no empirical evidence exists supporting this assertion. Evaluating the effectiveness of female-only polling stations is crucial for understanding how to reduce gender gaps in political participation. However, quantifying the effect of administrative decisions like gender-segregation is empirically challenging since most countries have either gender-segregated or mixed stations, but rarely both. We address this question using new data from the 2018 Pakistani General Election, which used both female-only, male-only, and gender-mixed polling stations across the country. This administrative feature allows us to match different types of stations within the same neighborhoods to identify the effects of female-only stations on female turnout and voting behavior, while holding constant other factors that might vary geographically and affect gender-specific turnout.

Findings from a Differences-in-Differences Design	Does the gap between women's and men's turnout decrease when female front-runners enter the electoral arena? In past decades the gender gap in voter turnout has decreased in many national elections, but persists in most sub-national elections. I argue that gender differences in turnout reduce once major parties select female politicians to lead their election campaigns, because female voters are more likely to turn out when a highly visible candidate from their respective group leads the election campaign. This paper estimates the causal effect of female front-runner entry on the gender gap in voter turnout with a differences-in-differences approach and administrative election statistics from German state elections between (1960-2018). Observational survey data from German state selections further identify mechanisms unobservable in the aggregate administrative data. The findings provide quasi-experimental evidence that the gender gap in voter turnout decreases after the entry of female front-runners, in particular among young voters, but only provide weak evidence against a true causal effect of very minor magnitude.

2021	0361	253	The gender politics of access to party office	Holding party office matters because it provides different types of resources, such as a sense of belonging and, most crucially, access to information, patronage and recruitment opportunities. All necessary factors for building successful political careers in public office. Several works have noted that party office is unevenly distributed across gender but, to date, most studies have focused on party leaders. Thus leaving unaccounted for both how party members get access to the core top decision-making bodies of the extra-parliamentary party organization; and how gendered dynamics underpin these selection processes. This article fills this gap by investigating both the organisational determinants and the gendered political opportunities shaping women’s access to political parties’ national executive committees (NECs). The empirical analysis builds on a novel dataset on the composition of NECs of all major political parties in Germany, Spain and Portugal. Our results show that, while male-dominance has gradually eroded in NECs –with some parties having already achieved a gender-balanced composition – the selection method in use, the organisational culture and parties’ decision environment still operate in gendered ways.

Examining the Irish #GE2020 Campaign on Social Media Using an Images-as-Data Approach	Twitter has become a battleground for election campaigns with almost all political candidates vying for office present on this medium. Studies examining the role of Twitter in election campaigns are numerous but almost exclusively focus on the textual content of tweets. Unexamined so far have been the images contained in those tweets and the messaging they attempt to convey. At the same time, we know that images can have powerful communicative effects that go above and beyond text alone. In this paper, we examine 45,000 campaign images tweeted by candidates during the Irish General Election campaign of 2020. We first present a fine-grained categorisation of those images, including categories such as community engagement, electioneering, image management, and policy content. We then report results from a set of pre-trained and context-specific classifiers used to predict image categories, relying on text and image features. Our results provide novel insight into the manner in which candidates use visual communications alongside text to promote messages to the electorate.	Political Communications
2021	0346	500	Someone like you? How “humanizing” politicians helps to reduce populist attitudes	Mounting evidence suggests that sizable shares of voters in many Western democracies hold populist attitudes but we know surprisingly little of how these attitudes are formed and changed. In this paper, we examine whether populist attitudes, in particular anti-elitist attitudes, are changeable by portraying politicians in a positive light. In other words, can focusing on presenting politicians in a positive light and as normal human beings change how populist people are? We do so with the help of a pre-registered survey experiment fielded in 2020 in Germany and Switzerland where respondents are allocated to video interventions focusing on presenting politicians in a positive light and as normal human beings. In detail, in order to highlight the 'human' nature of politicians and thus in an effort to make them more approachable and thus break the dichotomous view of elite vs people, we designed interventions focusing on presenting the politician as a normal human being that sometimes is either forced externally to change opinion or has internal reasons to change her opinion. A third treatment directly goes against the 'corrupt and dishonest' elite idea by highlighting honesty. Our findings show that indeed populist attitudes are malleable and thus dependent on elite behavior themselves. They shed light on an important dimension of populism and highlight the dynamic nature of populist attitudes.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0362	511	Someone like me? The role of identity in support for disabled candidates	Politicians with disabilities are still few and far between. This underrepresentation is a potential reason for the lower levels of political trust and engagement among the 1 in 5 people who live with a disability. Consequently, we might expect disabled candidates to receive particularly high levels of electoral support from disabled citizens. However, to what extent a unified disability identity exists remains debated, as there is great variation in both impairments and societal barriers. Research on other societal minorities suggests that differences in discrimination and social status as well as social distance perceptions might condition electoral support. This study draws on data from survey experiments with conjoint designs from representative samples of the British and US publics (N=6,000) to examine whether disabled citizens tend to vote for disabled representatives or whether this effect is limited to those with a shared impairment type. It tests the roles of identity and perceptions of shared political preferences. Not only are the findings significant for understanding the underexplored role of disability in electoral politics; they also provide insights and lessons for research on the electoral behaviour of subgroups of other societal minorities, including ethnic and racial minorities and gender and sexual minorities.

2021	0377	472	Assessing the Extent of Populist Attitudes among Voters Using Machine Learning	Even though research into populist attitudes among voters is still in its infancy, there is evidence suggesting that views exist among voters which reflect the core concerns of ideational populism, and validly tap into a single concept even across countries. Yet, it is precisely because of the novelty of this research strand that we still lack comparative evidence regarding the extent of populist attitudes and scope of their effects on political behavior especially over time. Have voters always been populist and did political actors merely politicize and activate such (latent) attitudes? Or does the level of populism hinge mostly on the presence of populist parties within a political system? In this paper, we first seek to predict populist attitudes of respondents of the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS/GGSS), before assessing the validity of our prediction and the effect of our predicted attitudes on vote choice in a second analytical step. To this end, we draw on the 2018 round of GGSS for which populist attitudes are available. We single out predictors that are theoretically related to populism yet distinguishable from host ideologies, to separate the two. Drawing on Machine Learning, we then assess the explanatory power of these (socio-economic and political) indicators to estimate populism within the 2018 round, before using these models to calculate a populism score for individuals going back in time. Finally, we assess the validity of our prediction and the effect of predicted populism scores on political behavior and voting decisions.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour
2021	0331	321	Parties, political rebels and the Querdenker movement: How German politicians have responded to the COVID-19 protests	Many European countries witnessed massive protests after governments adopted measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike other protest movements, the participants are often very diverse in terms of their motivation and political ideology. Recent research in Germany, for instance, shows that large percentages of the protesters used to vote for the Green party but plan to vote for the right-wing populist party AfD in upcoming elections. Therefore, the protests provide an opportunity to study the following questions: When do MPs of established parties positively engage with anti-system protests, against the party line? We draw from existing research on MPs' reaction to exogenous shocks and their voters' related attitudes as well as social movement literature emphasizing protest as control of political decision-making. Combining these research strands with studies on the individual level on rebels in representative democracies, we explain reaction patterns between and diversity within different parties. We analyze German parties' and politicians' reactions using parliamentary debates as well as the MPs' Tweets for daily updated data on an individual level covering the period from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of 2020. To quantify these reactions, we develop a new measure for an automated sentiment analysis explicitly tailored to COVID-19 protests. It relies on established sentiment analysis procedures combined with machine learning algorithms to obtain more accurate results. Our findings have important implications for the representation of protest by parties, especially when there is uncertainty about the views of their own voters on the issue.

2021	0347	611	The Empire Strikes Back: An Experiment on Brexit, Slavery and Imperial Nostalgia	To what extent can rising nationalist and populist attitudes in the UK be attributed to nostalgia for the days of empire? Details of the extent, practices, and legacies of empire – including the role of slavery - have not been taught in any detail in UK schools, nor meaningfully addressed by political institutions. As a result, many UK citizens are unaware of the levels of brutality and exploitation committed in the name of empire. This project explores whether the UK’s unwillingness to confront its past has led to vestigial imperialistic attitudes that have a powerful effect on modern political outcomes. For example, the campaign for Britain to leave the EU focused on returning to a time when Britain ‘had control’, implicitly evoking the country’s imperial past. I use an experimental approach to investigate the power of this nostalgia by assessing the extent to which information about the involvement of one’s ancestors in the imperial slave trade affects nationalist and populist attitudes. Using the UCL database on Legacies of British Slave Ownership, participants are exposed to the notion that their ancestral history may be tied to the slave trade, and the effect of this ‘treatment’ on attitudes towards key political issues (including immigration, redistribution and the Brexit) is then assessed. In line with the relevant literature on collective guilt, this will also involve an exploration of the psychological mechanisms underpinning any treatment effects. In addition, I will investigate whether guilt mechanisms primarily operate with respect to ancestral ties or national ties.	Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behaviour

This paper explores how the widely used populist, pluralist and elite survey index (e.g. Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove, 2014) relate to questions regarding attitudes towards gender equality. This way, it test to what extent populism as thin ideology relates to specific post-moden values like an aversion against gender-equality. Empirically, the paper relies on cross-section representative data from Denmark, which was collected in 2019. The paper's finding brings forward the general study of populism by empirically exploring to what extent the thin ideology of populism is to be tied to the question about post-modern values as a novel cleavage to be added to the broader puzzle of societal cleavages in the post-modern western world.

Evidence from Israel During COVID-19	Intergroup relations in protracted conflicts are typically analyzed in light of the conflict’s intrinsic dynamics. Yet, in recent years, global changes have increased the occurrence and intensity of shared exogenous threats such as extreme weather, natural disasters, and global pandemics. Do such shared external threats influence the willingness of groups in conflict to collaborate and assist one another? The literature produces inconsistent expectations. While some studies find that environmental and health crises can promote superordinate identities and cooperation, others argue that they deepen intergroup competition and ethnocentrism, and still others claim that they lack discernable impact on existing tensions. Our study explores this unresolved question in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploiting the spike in COVID-19 cases in both societies, we conducted a two-wave survey and a conjoint experiment among Israeli Jews to examine the extent and conditions under which they would support policies that fight the virus’s spread in the adjacent Palestinian territories. We find that the pandemic’s threat did not change the conflict’s core dynamic. Support for medical assistance, preference for improving the Palestinians’ situation, and willingness to collaborate with their leadership reflect partisan ideology and sense of national threat by the Palestinians rather than the anxiety and threat caused by the pandemic. These findings provide a sobering perspective on the expectation that shared exogenous threats could change existing intergroup dynamics in active conflicts.	International Relations and Conflict
2021	0332	374	Resources and Rape: Patterns of wartime rape in activist insurgencies	One of the most horrendous outcomes of civil wars is wartime rape. The variation in the intensity of wartime rape is the main puzzle in this research. This dissertation is focused on activist insurgencies and builds on the combatant socialization theory. It will investigate how social cohesion in activist insurgencies influences wartime rape. The argument concerns differential resource endowments explaining the variation of sexual violence in activist insurgencies. This paper will use new data and examine the pattern of wartime rape with a new approach. The results of the analysis indicate that activist insurgencies’ means of socialisation depend on available resources. The socialisation of fighters can be achieved through the combatant socialisation process or though political education	International Relations and Conflict

How do internal minorities fare under ethno-territorial autonomy arrangements? This article follows assertions that such groups are more likely to become involved in violent conflict for two reasons: First, reputation theory suggests that they might mobilize for the creation of their own homelands. Second, case studies indicate that they will be more frequently targeted in acts of local ethnic cleansing. Building on both, I argue that the creation of ethno-territorial homelands increases conflict risks for internal minorities especially if they were created amid recent violent contestation. This emboldens internal minorities to exert similar violent pressures of their own. At the same time, local majority groups are conscious of these risks. Thereby, they face incentives for preemptive strikes in order to secure their newly-attained homeland. Using a new, geo-coded dataset of territorial autonomy for more than 100 countries since the Second World War, I test these arguments on the territorial unit-group-year level. The findings indicate that the risks of becoming involved in political violence are indeed exacerbated for internal minorities living in other groups' homelands. Yet, they also suggest that these risks can be mitigated by investments in individual cultural rights and mutual security guarantees.	International Relations and Conflict

In light of a surge in extreme-right violent attacks and rising ethno-nationalist sentiment by politicians in the US and in Europe, it is important to understand how elite rhetoric can influence individual actions. Public speeches in particular remain an influential channel to spread divisive messages to like-minded audiences, and through mass media and social media, they spread to an even larger number of people. This paper takes a historical view to investigate plausible differences in exposure to elite messaging. I focus on the prominent case of Adolf Hitler during the later years of Weimar Germany from 1927 to 1933, a time of political turbulences that ultimately led to the demise of the young German democracy. I analyze a newly constructed data set of geocoded violent events in the Weimar Republic, retrieved from a corpus of historical newspapers and supplemented by additional contemporary sources and qualitative work by historians. Following work by Selb and Munzert (2018), I use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of public appearances of Hitler on the likelihood of violent incidents. The empirical results indicate a limited effect of Hitler's speeches and underline the importance of dynamics within violent groups and social movements.	International Relations and Conflict

In order to identify the causal effect of terrorism, many recent studies have taken an Unexpected Events during Surveys Design (UESD) approach. These studies exploit the occurrence of terror attacks during the fieldwork of surveys, which quasi-experimentally split the sample between respondents interviewed before and after the attack, and thus exposed and not exposed to the terrorist violence. Results of these studies, however, have been mixed. We claim that the reason is that the effect of terrorist attacks is contingent on the specific characteristics of the event and the context surrounding it. In an effort to average out the specificities of individual attacks, this paper leverages the accidental coincidence of over 70 terror attacks perpetrated by ETA during the fieldwork of surveys administered by the main Spanish public opinion institute, involving more than 200,000 interviews. Using this multiple UESD approach, we are able to identify that the causal effect of terrorism predictably varies with certain characteristics of the attack, such as closeness to elections and selectivity of the targets. Our results shed light on the controversy over the electoral effect of terrorism, but are also relevant in pointing out the limits of the identification strategy based on the occurrence of a single, or a small number of unexpected events.

The debate is fueled by politicians like Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and representatives of populist parties who evidently communicate less sophisticated than mainstream politicians. As a result, ever more scholarly work seeks to understand the impact of simple and sophisticated political communication on voters and elites. Yet, existing research falls short of identifying the causal mechanisms between politicians’ linguistic sophistication and voters’ reactions to it. We study the effect of sophisticated political communication on voter attitudes using a large-scale pre-registered vignette survey experiment in Germany. On the one hand, we isolate the effect of sophisticated language by leveraging the (comprehensively pre-tested) fact that linguistic sophistication in the German language can be manipulated by sentence length, word length, and word familiarity while keeping content and positions constant. On the other hand, we use a manipulation test to understand if voters’ rely on language as a heuristic for unknown characteristics of politicians – such as class. The findings of our pre-test reveal that sophisticated messages (as compared to simple messages) reduce message recall and the willingness to share the message. Moreover, exposure to messages shapes voters’ perceptions of politicians. Respondents draw inferences from the level of sophistication about the politician’s class belonging and level of education. These findings add important new insights to our understanding of the effects of political communication in contemporary democracies.	Political Communications

People who are more informed are shown to be more engaged with politics. These conclusions have been drawn by comparing political information survey questions where the individuals who gave the correct answer(s) to respondents who either gave the wrong answer(s) or opted for the Don’t Know. Yet, past research offers little insight to the reliability of this combined counterfactual of political knowledge. This is mostly due to the underlying assumption, particularly in close-ended questions, that those who give the wrong answer can be considered as uninformed as the respondents who admit to not knowing. We theorise that what links political knowledge to political engagement is not only the possession of information, but also the perception of being informed. This leads us to question if respondents who gave the incorrect answer are the perfect counterfactual for those who are deemed well-informed when explaining political engagement. Our results show that political knowledge literature cannot ignore the role of “false” knowledge. People who give incorrect answers are more similar to those who we consider as informed, when it comes to political participation and interest, than those who admit to simply not knowing.

This method, however, is not always appropriate as it assumes that these dimensions are complementary and contribute consistently to one attitude. In reality, they sometimes do not compensate one another, and the combination of their values constitutes distinct attitudinal patterns. This study argues that tapping multidimensional constructs as such requires sorting survey respondents into attitudinal patterns, and to fulfill this task, machine learning provides two tools. The first is empirical-based supervised learning. That is, scholars annotate a small proportion of respondents into attitudinal patterns based on their empirical knowledge. The machine learns the annotated dataset and classifies those unannotated respondents accordingly. Compared with relying solely on human annotation, this method can be easily applied to large datasets. The second is theory-guided semi-supervised clustering. That is, scholars designate the values of the ideal types of each pattern according to their theoretical knowledge. The machine learns these ideal types and clusters respondents into attitudinal patterns. Compared with unsupervised clustering, this method is guided by scholars’ theoretical knowledge and, therefore, generates results that are theoretically meaningful. Taken together, this study reveals that machine learning not only boosts the efficiency of data analysis, it can also incorporate scholars’ empirical and theoretical knowledge into the analysis.

Recent theoretical work suggests that representation is best described as a fundamentally multidimensional concept, but existing empirical work is limited to evaluating either the ideological or the demographic congruence between voters and politicians. In this paper, we introduce new survey instruments to expand our understanding of how voters think about their political representatives. First, we describe a new survey battery which is straightforward to implement in existing surveys; which applies to different political systems; and which captures voter preferences over six distinct dimensions of representation. Second, we use a conjoint design to evaluate the relative importance of these dimensions in the minds of voters when they consider the representational merits of different politicians. Applying our approach to the UK, the US, and Germany, we find that voters' representational demands differ systematically across political systems, and that individual voter characteristics are also strongly predictive of preferences over representation. A core implication of our findings is that voters do not have a uniform desire for 'more' or 'less' representation, but rather that different voters favour different aspects of representation in different political contexts.

However, they are also often unpopular and untrusted among voters. Even in party-centred systems, individual Members of Parliament sometimes see dissent from their own party as a way to increase their support within the electorate. Increasing evidence suggests that voters do indeed express support for these rebellious politicians in multiple contexts. But why? Dissent could impede the parties that these voters support from attaining their goals and perhaps even undermine representative democracy. Drawing on theories of political representation, we examine the causes behind voter support for rebels using survey experiments conducted in four countries — Germany, France, Italy and the UK. In contrast to previous studies, we examine whether voters like rebels because rebels (a) take a policy position that is in line with voters’ own policy preferences, (b) voters think that rebellion is in line with the public’s preferences or (c) because voters attribute more positive character traits to rebels than to non-rebels. We additionally allow respondents to rate individual MPs rather than asking them to choose between two sitting MPs, something they would rarely do in an electoral contest. While we find support for the notion that voters like rebels and that they attribute more positive character traits to rebels, our evidence is weaker than in much of the existing research, and highly contingent on policy congruence.

Which authorities have the most influence over which individuals and which types of communities? What is the basis of their influence? These questions have theoretical and substantive significance. We conduct conjoint endorsement experiments that allow us to measure the basis of authority and the levels of legitimacy of different leaders across two different sub-Saharan Africa countries. The experimental arms are designed to allow us to explore whether sanctioning, coordination, or legitimacy drive individuals’ willingness to comply with leaders’ directives. We embed this experiment in the Local Governance Performance Index (LGPI), which is designed to be representative at the local level and provide community-level indicators. Doing so allows us to explore the relationship between community- and individual-level factors, the strength of different authorities in different contexts, and the factors underlying their influence. The analyses relating contextual and individual characteristics to authorities are observational, of course; nevertheless, they provide important leverage on questions regarding in what conditions different authorities can demand compliance, and over whom they have influence.

The ideal of promissory representation and the responsible party model expect parties to formulate pledges before an election and to keep them when they become part of the government. Empirically, however, government parties sometimes fail to live up to this normative ideal, as a growing body of comparative research on pledge fulfilment has shown. Pledge breakage is not only a consequence of unwillingness and ignorance of parties, but also of compromising with others, such as coalition partners. This paper provides the first analysis of voters’ expectations based on a representative online survey conducted in Germany with more than 10,000 respondents. It shows that while many voters understand that there might be situations in which government parties cannot or should fulfil their pledges, there is low tolerance that government parties deviate from pledges for the sake of coalition compromise. In addition, populist attitudes and support of a permanent opposition decrease citizens’ tolerance, while ideological orientations are not important in explaining individual differences. These findings have major implications for our understanding of political representation and democratic legitimacy.	Political Methodology
