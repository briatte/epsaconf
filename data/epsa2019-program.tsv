Explanations are centered on the interests of political agents or on exogenous variables, such as external shocks. However, this approach is limited: there are other dimensions of the electoral law (like campaign finance or media coverage) that have an impact on elections results; the selection of cases introduces a bias in the results, leaving institutional stability unexploited; and there is a set of variables of the political process that can influence the results. This paper analyzes the impact of these variables on the electoral law reform process, understanding it as a 5-step procedure. The Portuguese case is studied between 1999 and 2015, in which different governments tried to approve (without achieving) reforms in the electoral system, but in which several substantial changes were made to the financing mechanisms and to the media coverage laws. This study explores the nature and timing of the proposals, of the previous reform processes, as well as short-term factors.	Ricardo Carvalho

Radical Party Entry, the Formation of Electoral Alliances, and the Introduction of Proportional Representation	A dominant strand of literature holds that proportional representation was introduced by a fragmented camp of established parties facing an electorally strong and ideologically radicalized socialist party. However, the mechanisms proposed by Rokkan and Boix have not been investigated on the micro-level to date. I focus on Imperial Germany as a most likely case for the socialist threat approach. I employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of a socialist candidate entering runoffs on non-socialist alliance formation and vote share. I demonstrate that the entry of a socialist to runoffs substantively increases the propensity of established parties to forge alliances. In addition, I show that the vote share of the non-socialist candidate increases when alliances are formed but not if alliances are absent. The results question the internal validity of Rokkan's and Boix's approach and contribute to the literature on the introduction of PR and the impact of radical parties on electoral competition.

Many observers see “fairness” as an important criterion held by citizens for judging elections and election rules. Reformers often seek “fairer” outcomes, while attempts at electoral gamesmanship by politicians (e.g., gerrymandering, altering eligibility to vote rules) are criticized as “unfair.” Fairness, then, is viewed as a valuable and positive attribute of elections. Actions labeled unfair are seen to be incompatible with the electoral process even if that action would serve to advance the individual’s partisan self-interests. Previously, we showed that dedication to electoral fairness is often malleable, with partisans frequently voicing less opposition to reforms they have previously evaluated as unfair when those policies would benefit their party. But when reminded of fairness norms, citizens may walk back their inclination to support unfair reforms for partisan gain. It may therefore be possible to recover the usefulness of fairness as a criterion for judging elections. Using a series of experiments, we find little evidence that this is, in fact, the case. Voters persist in seeing elections through a partisan lens, even after being reminded of the value of fairness.	Shaun Bowler

In Brazil the number of parties has increased significantly since the first election after the 1988 constitution, even though no significant institutional change has taken place. Existing explanations of fragmentation cannot account for this. We use data for seven elections at the national and state levels to show that the increase in fragmentation observed in Brazil is due to the entry of new parties and the denationalization of the party system. The latter process results from the uncertainty marginally competitive candidates face regarding their post-electoral position in the party list. This induces them to move to smaller parties which, given the rules, are able to make the chance of election at least as high as in the larger party. The increasing number of strong candidates running under smaller labels leads to the progressive denationalization of the party system, and the ultimate increase in the number of parties with representation in the national Chamber.

Previous literature has focused on electoral explanations; they highlight how bourgeoisie parties tried to maintained power in the face of the rise of social democratic parties, opting for PR as the second best solution. We argue that the electoral approach must be accompanied with a labor market approach to give a complete picture. Using roll call data from six reform proposals in 1919 Norway, we find that bourgeoisie candidates that were exposed to worker militancy in the form of strikes in their electoral constituency were more likely to vote for the introduction of PR, even when controlling for social democratic vote share in their constituency. Indicators of employer organization are also a significant predictor of conservatives voting for PR.	Magnus Rasmussen, Haakon Gjerløw

I provide a framework to study the political choices of low SES individuals as the outcome of coping with the self-esteem and shame threats emerging from low status. Building on different strands of literature, I identify four stylized strategies to cope with these threats: “Problem-focused”, “meaning-focused”, “withdrawal”, and “aggression” coping. I argue that these coping strategies can result in different political behaviors, namely left redistributive vote, non-class based vote, vote abstention and far-right vote, respectively, and review evidence from political science and social psychology supporting this connection. The framework can integrate several existing theories explaining political choices of low SES individuals and provide new insights on the study of populism and political abstention. I consider factors that lead individuals of similar SES to adopt these different coping styles. I bring the framework to bear on data from original surveys in very diverse contexts: South Africa, Tunisia, and Ireland.	Miquel Pellicer

The Role of Political Efficacy in Support for Populism	It has been suggested that the global rise of populism experienced in recent decades can be linked to the gradual growth of objective and subjective indicators of political competence usually referred to as the process of “cognitive mobilization.” Along these lines, this paper tests the rather paradoxical claim that populist attitudes among citizens are enhanced by stronger feelings of internal political efficacy (i.e. the self-perceived ability to understand and to participate in politics). Drawing on a collection of cross-national, longitudinal, and experimental data, we find internal efficacy to be consistently related to support for populism. Furthermore, results indicate that this association may be explained in part by the role of internal efficacy in facilitating the emergence of feelings of anger in the presence of threat. These findings underscore the role of political competence and emotion as a unifying characteristic of support for populism in Western European societies, while also suggesting paths for addressing the consequences of rising populist attitudes.

This paper focuses on the decline of trust in national parliaments and political parties across over thirty European democracies during the period 2002 to 2016, and on its effects on party choice with the goal of providing a better understanding of the decline of mainstream as well as the rise of populist and radical parties. Using individual-level survey data from eight waves of the European Social Survey we use “pseudo-panels” and matching approaches to estimate dynamic models from repeated-cross sections. We apply the method to investigate how political trust develops and affects party choice. Special emphasis is put into identifying which dissatisfied mainstream voters switch to moderate parties and which switch to populist/radical parties. Our first results indicate that distrust affects the support for mainstream parties and motivates voters to support third-parties. Furthermore, they demonstrate that some third parties benefit more than others from the electoral loses of mainstream parties.	Constanza Sanhueza Petrarca, Heiko Giebler

The median voter theorem (MVT) states that two candidates, competing in a single member district (SMD), will converge ideologically to the median voter’s policy preference. Combining MVT with Duverger’s law implies that all SMD elections should eventually converge to the median voter. However, multiple candidates do compete, and research on real-world data has repeatedly shown non-convergence. One of the previously proposed reasons of non-convergence has been this involvement of multiple candidates. I propose that, even when elections eventually feature only two candidates, the campaign process which leads to the emergence of these two candidates will likely result in non-median convergence. This paper uses a simulation approach to demonstrate predictable, non-median convergence, and is illustrated via real world data - the 2016 U.S. Republican presidential primaries – single-winner elections with multiple candidates and a non-median winner.

Radical Right Parties‘ Indirect Effect on Immigration Policies.	My paper examines the oppositional influence of radical right parties (RRP) on immigration policies and thereby represents a first step to illuminate the ‘black hole’ regarding indirect policy effects. Scholarship has heretofore mainly focused on RRP’ impact on party competition and only recently started to address their oppositional effect on legislative behaviour. Drawing on Sulkin’s theory of issue uptake, indirect effects of RRP are understood as interaction of their campaign stance and the subsequent electoral result. My quantitative analysis of up to 33 industrialized countries over 30 years introduces a heretofore largely absent cross-national perspective. Differentiating between economic, social and humanitarian aspects of immigration policy also extends the topical scope of existing scholarship. Preliminary results indicate that agency and electoral threat by RRP are linked to more restrictive immigration policies irrespective of their mere parliamentary presence. My paper shows the necessity to consider indirect effects of radical right parties on immigration policy in more detail. Additionally, it provides first insights into the influence of oppositional parties on legislative behaviour in emerging policy areas such as globalisation and environmentalism.	Valentin Berger

The effect of refugee settlement on politicians' policy stances	How does the exposure to refugees affect politicians' issue stances? This paper uses a novel panel data set of Finnish politicians' responses to voting advice applications to empirically measure how politicians thought about refugee intake before and after they were exposed to refugee arrivals and how much spillover the refugee issue creates to other policy sectors. Moreover, the paper measures how the local political context as well as the candidates' vulnerability and party family possibly account for heterogeneous response to refugee arrivals and how much electoral reward there is for different stances. The data enables us to implement a robust difference-in-differences analysis with respect to one of the burning questions in political science, namely, what drives native's responses to immigration and refugee intake in today's Europe and what the policy-related repercussions are of this increased refugee intake.

At the same time, research suggests this is a losing strategy: when mainstream political parties shift towards niche party positions, their vote totals shrink and niche parties gain votes. These two strands of research suggest that niche parties, acting as issue entrepreneurs, can become more electorally viable. However, the ability of niche parties to grow electoral strength may be dependent on the ability to niche parties to “infect” mainstream parties, and shift their positions. This study examines whether such a vector, from niche party issue entrepreneurship, to mainstream party position shifts, to voters abandoning mainstream parties for niche parties does, indeed, exist. Focusing on immigration and ecological policy in Europe, we use data from the Comparative Manifestos Project, ParlGov, and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems to test this relationship. This study has important implications for understanding dynamics of parties’ strategies and party competition, as well as the growing strength of niche parties in advanced democratic states.

This study examines whether such a vector, from niche party issue entrepreneurship, to mainstream party position shifts, to voters abandoning mainstream parties for niche parties does, indeed, exist. Focusing on immigration and ecological policy in Europe, we use data from the Comparative Manifestos Project, ParlGov, and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems to test this relationship. This study has important implications for understanding dynamics of parties’ strategies and party competition, as well as the growing strength of niche parties in advanced democratic states.

Given this attitude-behavior gap some call upon the state to regulate and incentivize sustainable consumption. Yet, serious public opposition is expected when governments introduce costly policies, especially in case the state intervenes into citizens’ personal consumption choices. To test this widespread assumption, we concentrate on the food sector and employ a stated-choice experiment with an original, representative sample of 4’874 citizens from China, Germany, and the United States to compare public support for packages of different policy types (i.e., market-based, regulatory and information-based instruments) aiming at the reduction of meat and fish products. In contrast to our expectations, we find that citizens across three major economies do not strongly oppose the introduction of costly policies in the food sector. We show that public support depends on specific policy design features such as the policy stringency and revenue earmarking, but not necessarily on the instrument type. We also find cross-country variations and explore how personal values interact with policy support.	Lukas Fesenfeld, Michael Wicki

However, it is unclear whether such attitudes can affect support for such policies when they are not being primarily framed through an environmental lens in the public sphere. This paper examines this issue using the case of support for the reintroduction of water charges in Ireland using data from the 2011 Irish National Election Study. This was a contentious issue with debate largely focused on the policy's potential economic and social impacts in the context of a struggling national economy, but its important environmental implications were largely sidelined.The results find that while individuals’ willingness to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth at the policy level did not affect their support for water charges, their willingness to make individual sacrifices for the environment did. These findings have a particular importance given the recent struggles that governments are facing in implementing environmental taxes and charges.	John Kenny

Voluntary responsible business measures by multinationals and public opinion on regulatory standards	Can firms preempt government regulation by running voluntary social and environmental programs? We investigate public support for regulatory standards when multinational corporations conduct voluntary social/environmental measures. We propose that from the viewpoint of citizens, the perception of regulation gaps depends on corporate practice. Firms can signal through voluntary measures that they already engage in pro-environmental/pro-social behaviour, making government-imposed rules obsolete. Moreover, we argue that this signal varies with involved sectors, number of firms and by inclusion of external oversight over voluntary measures. We study the question for the case of a popular initiative in Switzerland. In a survey embedded experiment fielded in late 2018, we test whether support for regulation as such and for the popular initiative in particular decreases if voters receive a signal on corporate action. Preliminary results indicate that voluntary measures tend to decrease public support for government regulation. It seems, however, that the type of voluntary measures is more relevant in that relationship than hitherto assumed. Our results shed light on an understudied mechanism by which firms affect government policy.	Dennis Kolcava

This empirical pattern holds across countries with vastly different economic and political characteristics and is not well accounted for in exist- ing models of political economy. This article explains why most affluent individuals fail to recognize that they belong to the high-income income group and how this misperception affect their preferences over progressive tax rates. To explain this mechanism theoretically, I propose a model of generating perceptions about income distribution through self-comparison to an endogenous reference group. These perceptions, in turn, affect preferences over progressive taxation. Relying on ISSP data and an original survey experiment, I find strong evidence for the model’s empirical implications: most high-income earners support progressive taxation when they identify with the lower income groups. Additionally, individuals who overestimate the annual income of the high-income group are more likely to support progressive taxation.	Asli Cansunar

Focusing on the case of transportation, we test public support for different policy-designs including different market-based as well as command-and-control push and pull instruments. Previous literature suggests that push measures are less supported compared to pull measures. Additionally, it is argued that market-based instruments receive lowest support, because costs are more visible compared to other measures. We also test how support depends on the earmarking of tax revenues and individual car dependency. In our empirical analysis we employ a stated-choice experiment with an original, representative sample of 4’876 citizens conducted in early 2018 in China, Germany, and the United States. In contrast to the theoretical expectations, we find that public support does not necessarily depend on the instrument type but rather on specific policy design features such as policy stringency and revenue earmarking. Individual car dependency significantly influences public support. Overall, our results show interesting variations of policy design effects on public support among the three country cases.

By strengthening institutions, imposing transparency rules, and arresting officials, regimes claim they are enforcing discipline within the bureaucracy and responding to popular grievances. However, there is little evidence that these initiatives are anything more than a facade to increase regime legitimacy. Campaigns are accused of targeting political opponents rather than taking on complicit officials. Part of the difficulty in evaluating these reforms is establishing a baseline level of corruption before they are begun. In response, this paper investigates a major anti-corruption campaign in Russia which required high-level officials to disclose foreign properties and the funds used to purchase them. First, I match sales records from Florida counties to census data on where Russian-language speakers reside. Using a difference-in-differences design, I then demonstrate that purchases of expensive real estate, in particular those that used anonymous LLCs as the transaction party, dropped in Russian-speaking areas after the passage of the law. These results suggest that domestic anti-corruption campaigns can compel elite loyalty to the regime by reducing their international exit options.	David Szakonyi

I analyze data from a panel survey experiment in which respondents in are asked to watch video news reports on (a) Outcomes of the medical and educational policy, and/or (b) Information on responsibility allocation for these policies between municipal and regional government. Respondents are then asked to evaluate the outcomes of various economic policies as well as performance of different levels of government. The design me to learn whether popularity of the government in countries without strong democratic traditions and vibrant media is predicated on potentially strategic framing by the media. One unique feature of this study is its focuse not just on performance, but also on responsibility allocation between multiple tiers of the government. This feature allows me to test ability of citizens to correctly attribute responsibility in multi-level government structures -- important but empirically understudied aspect of political accountability in comparative context.

The Benefits to Autocrats from Popular Approval	Why do authoritarian regimes desire approval from their populations? Existing theories of when and why authoritarian regimes desire an approving populace are concerned with threats of revolution and unrest (Acemoglu and Robinson 2005) or ultimately focus on specific subsets of the mass public (Svolik 2012). But beyond foreclosing existential threats from revolution, an approving public offers many potential benefits to autocrats over a discontented public. In this paper, I develop a broad theory of why and when non-democracies may seek the approval of the mass public. I differentiate between approval for various actors within authoritarian regimes as well as economic and political sources of approval. I test the currency of potential benefits using a newly-assembled monthly dataset of Russian public opinion consisting of nearly 1 million responses, novel search engine data, and observational data. I identify plausibly causal effects by leveraging sudden shocks to regime support and regional economic performance measures. The findings in this paper have implications for how we understand autocratic stability and rule, the role of public opinion in authoritarian regimes, and authoritarian accountability.	Noah Buckley

In the case of public investments in non-democratic countries and developing democracies, I find support for both of these crucial assumptions. Using data on georeferenced investment projects across Africa, I find that these investments are more in line with the president's preferences prior to presidential elections, but more in line with legislators' preferences close to legislative elections. Taken together, the findings strongly suggest that legislators in such systems do have the power to demand concessions from president, and that unfree elections can discipline political elites.

How does pre-emptive repression – such as prohibitions on assembly – affect dissent in electoral autocracies? Does information that rallies have been unsanctioned undermine, or bolster support for the opposition in these regimes? Leveraging empirical evidence from regional media sources and an original protest-event dataset of more than 10,000 entries, this paper identifies, for the first time, subnational variation in cycles of pre-emptive repression in contemporary Russia. Results demonstrate an inverse relationship between prohibitions of assembly and protest frequency, as well as a positive correlation between unauthorised protests and the use of police violence in these events. Moreover, an original framing experiment, embedded in a face-to-face survey of Russian voters, allows us to provide causal evidence of how information that rallies are unsanctioned influences the propensity to engage in unrest and shapes support for the opposition. Findings add to recent studies on the observational challenges of studying repression in autocracies and have implications for the literatures on protests and authoritarian resilience.

Examining the impact of anti-Iraq War protests on congressional voting	Empirical evidence is mixed whether social movements can exert a political impact. For instance, despite repeated and large-scale anti-Iraq War demonstrations since 2003, protesters in the US neither prevented the war nor achieved an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. To examine the impact of protests, recent research highlights that a better understanding of protest dynamics can be obtained when using disaggregated data. By linking state-level protest events to individual roll call votes in the House of Representatives, I analyze whether members of Congress are responsive to protests in their home state. The analysis uses new data on anti-Iraq War protests and individual voting behavior on the withdrawal or redeployment of troops from Iraq between 2003 and 2008. Results show that a representative is more likely to vote for a redeployment of troops and an end of war in Iraq when an antiwar protest occurred in his or her home state. The substantial effect, however, is smaller than the role of party affiliation. This suggests that protest on military matters and international conflict may only be of limited political impact.

The Causal Effect of Protests on Public Opinion	What is the effect of protests on public opinion? While contentious actions are an essential form of claims-making, we still have limited knowledge of their short-term consequences on the attitudes of the population at large. This paper fills this gap by elaborating a theory of the effect of protests on public opinion. I argue that protests can help create the kind of informed, critical citizens that many authors have considered important for the quality of democracy. That is because protests voice non-institutionalized actors instead of elites in the public debate, making that debate more relatable. I test this claim with resource to a quasi-experimental design that takes advantage of a large protest that happened during the fieldwork of the ESS5 in Portugal. Supporting the argument, exposure to the protest increased dissatisfaction with elite performance and time spent reading about politics in newspapers. I test the mechanism using a difference-in-differences design, which shows that the protest caused an increase in the number of claims by non-institutionalized actors reported in the press.

Elections are only part of this. However, in the years between elections, citizen's power to influence policy design and implementation is limited. Forms of participatory democracy have been promoted as a solution to this problem. Yet, evidence on whether they are effective is scant (Mutz, 2007), and that which is available, suggests that little feeds into policy design and implementation (Voorberg, Bekkers & Tummers 2015). This study employs a large field experiment (N=7,532) to test (1) whether citizen input filters through to bureaucrats tasked with policy design and implementation. Given that a lack of motivation to engage with citizen input poses a serious obstacle to the functioning of inter-election democracy, the field experiment further tests (2) whether bureaucrats' engagement with citizen input can be increased by using non-monetary rewards and value-based communication (e.g. Gallus 2017; Kosfeld & Neckermann 2011). I find a low level of baseline engagement (~30%) but that motivational interventions increase engagement with citizen input to ~60%.	Annabelle Wittels

Deliberation among judges has a central role in the judicial decision making process as emphasized by scholars and judges alike. The quality of such deliberation is therefore essential to successful adjudication. In this paper I argue that collegial deliberation works better when judges are more familiar with each other. Relying on a novel data set of appeals in criminal cases at the German Federal Court of Justice I show that familiarity substantially increases the probability that judges disagree after first stage deliberations and schedule a main hearing. On the other hand, judges new to the court and judges serving outside their usual panel conform more often to the opinion of other judges which decreases the likelihood of a main hearing. Finally, I find some evidence that familiar panels tend to write longer justifications while those by panels with outsider judges tend to be shorter. I conclude that the quality of adjudication can be improved by promoting familiarity between as many judges as possible.	Tilko Swalve

Despite the typical anonymity of lower-court judges in such legal systems, we are able to exploit a natural experiment in Spain that allows us to estimate the effect of judges’ policy preferences, gender, and career incentives on decisions regarding the protection of victims of domestic violence. To do so, we combine the attitudinal and strategic models of judicial behavior, arguing that the effect of policy preferences on such decisions is moderated by gender. We find, first, that the probability to grant a restraining order is significantly higher among female judges than male judges. Secondly, that policy preferences affect only male judges. These findings are a relevant contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms behind judicial decision bias under civil-law systems, where judges’ policy preferences tend to be unobservable by institutional design.

Evidence from two experimental studies, namely a laboratory- and a survey-experiment, conducted with an identical parametrization of the OG, can be summarized in two points: First, the rational solution, a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, as well as the minimax decision rule fail to predict subjects' behavior. Second, individual characteristics matter, as higher levels of risk aversion make inspection more and shirking less likely, while PSM has only a limited effect on subjects’ behavior in the OG. These findings hint towards the conceptual limits of PSM and highlight the importance of understanding risk preference in order to devise effective oversight systems.	Markus Tepe

I argue that the effect of repression on dissent depends largely on whether systemic opposition parties join forces with non-systemic opposition forces that facilitates continued mobilization and can subsequently withstand violent repression. Under authoritarian rule, in exchange for crucial electoral support, systemic opposition parties have electoral incentives to seek out and develop societal-electoral alliances with independent non-systemic opposition groups that tend to have extensive associational and social networks that are conducive for collective action. In return, systemic opposition parties can provide significant financial, logistic, and institutional resources that are otherwise limited in authoritarian settings. Without such societal-electoral strategic coalition, the costs of continued mobilization in the face of increased repression are often too great to bear. In authoritarian regimes where such societal-electoral coalition exists, violent repression, rather than effectively suppresses dissent, can lead to further mobilization and escalate into a larger conflict.

However, the promotion of open government data, through initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and as conditionalities tied to foreign aid, has motivated many of the world's more closed regimes to produce and publish fine-grained data on public goods, taxation, etc. While this has been a boon to scholars of non-democracies, we argue that the politics of data production and dissemination create new challenges including threats to inference and ethical concerns. Systematically missing or biased data and selective restrictions on data collection may jeopardize research quality and lead scholars to parrot the `party line' in data form. To demonstrate this, we compare data from Tanzania's Open Data Portal with verified internal figures. Furthermore, the high stakes of data transparency lead to new risks for researchers, local data collectors and research subjects. Such risks can further the extractive nature of research in non-Western settings. We conclude with recommendations on how scholars can educate themselves about the politics of data, acknowledge potential bias, and leverage other methods where possible.	Rachael McLellan

This paper investigates the economic foundations of ethnic ruling coalitions. We study how natural resource endowments have historically affected ethnic groups’ representation in national governments. Cash crop producing groups are better represented due to two main mechanisms. On the one hand, cash cropping groups had an early advantage in terms of elite formation and collective mobilization. On the other, they are more attractive coalition partners for incumbents who want to tax areas of diffuse agricultural export production. We combine information on the ethnic homelands of African cabinet ministers with new data on the geospatial location of major export commodities in the late colonial age. Our results show that cash crop groups are overrepresented in African post-independence ruling coalitions while mining or food-producing locations are not. We estimate causal effects by instrumenting colonial cash crops with agro-climatic suitability scores and exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in global commodity prices to predict within-group changes in representation levels.

We test these arguments using georeferenced data from rounds 3-6 of the Afrobarometer. Our results suggest that membership in a divided group is actually associated with greater identification with the nation-state. These results are robust to different measures of the extent to which an ethnic group was split, use of different conceptualizations of what constitutes ethnic groups, and various considerations of ethnic groups' local and national demographic and political power. We consider several possible explanations for these findings, including whether colonizers explicitly avoided dividing groups with particularly strong pre-colonial identities, and whether division had detrimental effects on groups' institutions and identities, thereby weakening them vis-à-vis non-divided groups.

Although the origins of BGI have been investigated by other authors, little attention has been paid to the long-run sources of variation in WGI. We theorize that, in sub-Saharan Africa, WGI is primarily determined by the type of political institutions in place prior to colonization. In particular, ethnic groups with highly centralized pre-colonial institutions tend to have lower levels of within-group inequality today. Using a dataset on more than 400 ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa, we show that pre-colonial institutions have a significant effect on WGI. We also demonstrate that the effect of pre-colonial institutions is stronger that that of geographic endowments and colonial institutions.	Christian Houle

Theoretical explanations for why the public support or oppose affirmative action have centered on left-right ideological divides on the role of government; the competition for scarce resources and the perception of threat; and racial prejudice. Most studies have focused on the U.S. context, but Brazil has recently introduced wide-ranging affirmative action policies affecting both admission to federal universities and public sector employment. To date, a body of research has focused on the effects of these new quotas on higher education---but, to our knowledge---no studies have explored the public perceptions toward affirmative action quotas in the federal bureaucracy. We turn to a unique survey asked of a random sample of the Brazilian population, and conducted in partnership with the federal government, that employs a set of survey experiments to evaluate attitudes toward affirmative action. Our analysis sheds new light on debates in the literature on the determinants of political attitudes surrounding these contentious polices, and also speaks more generally to the public debate about affirmative action in Brazil and beyond.

We have two key interests: First, we seek to understand the role of the value of the exchanged goods, their scarcity, the asymmetry of the relationship between patron and client, and the size of the beneficiary group in driving the evaluation.

Using data from a program in India that provides a fixed allotment to MPs to undertake public works projects in their constituencies, the analyses show that pre-election periods exhibited a significant increase - relative to other periods - in the proportion of funds allocated to projects that ultimately did not get completed. Further analyses cast doubt on the possibility that the results are driven by strained bureaucratic capacity, increased corruption or delays resulting from the manipulations of opposition parties. Instead, the results appear to be driven by incumbent turnover produced by the election as well as by the propensity of incumbents to propose a greater proportion of unqualified projects in pre-election periods.

On the one hand, it has been proposed that internet use increases information, which in return contributes to social capital and facilitates liberalization. On the other hand, additional work suggests that internet use either escalates the conflict or contributes to the resilience of authoritarian regimes. This paper aims to reconcile these empirical findings by using a novel methodological approach that combines the logic of competing risks, repeated events to explore the interaction of internet use and political mobilization on the likelihood of recent political transitions to and from democracy. Based on the Freedom House Index, we categorize regime transitions for 85 countries between 2000 and 2015. Our estimation results reveal that in liberalizing transitions, internet use and mobilization together increase the likelihood of transition. In backsliding transitions, internet use and mobilization reduce the likelihood of autocratic reversal. This study not only resolves an existing debate but also introduces a novel methodological approach.	Berna Öney

At the same time, mass surveillance may interfere with civil liberties and potentially undermines citizens’ political trust. This study examines how mass surveillance affects citizens’ political trust. Specifically, we argue that the way in which surveillance policies are linked to political trust is contingent upon the range and scope of the policy measure (dragnet versus targeted), the salience of security-related threats (esp. terrorist attacks), individual preferences for security, and the risk of authorities violating data protection. Using country and time fixed effects models on repeated cross-sectional European Social Survey waves merged with time-series information on (changes) in surveillance laws (2002-2008), we find that the implementation of untargeted surveillance policies relates to decreasing political trust, on average. However, an extension of targeted surveillance is associated with increasing political trust, but only for individuals who emphasize security values. The hypothesized (conditional) relationships will be further specified and empirically tested using a pre-registered vignette survey experiment to be carried out in February 2019.	Conrad Ziller

A long line of theoretical literature leads us to expect that technological advancements facilitate the adoption of a national identity. We investigate the effect of one dimension of technological progress: the expansion of mobile phone coverage across sub-Saharan Africa, which is believed to induce broad changes in political and social life. We use a novel combination of geocoded public opinion data and fine-grained data on mobile phone coverage boundaries. Applying a geographic regression discontinuity design, we show that access to mobile technology decreases the likelihood that an individual identifies with the nation by around 5-7 percentage points. We hypothesize that the decrease in national identification is a result of the ethnically-polarized nature of political rhetoric that is often shared via cell phone networks, especially in the run-up to elections. To establish support for this mechanism, we exploit as-if random variation in the timing of individuals' survey interviews to presidential elections. Our analysis suggests that the proximity to elections intensifies the effect of mobile coverage.	Benjamin Laughlin

ISP control the gateway through which data flows in and out and can be seen as “gatekeepers” of the internet. They are thus key actors when it comes to providing and also interrupting access to internet services.

The paper traces current variations in women’s political attitudes and participation within sub-Saharan Africa to the emergence of a female-biased sex ratio during the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade. This historic shock forced women to substitute for the missing men in communities affected, changing women’s role in society and politics lasting up until today. Exploiting variation in the degree to which different ethnic groups were affected by the transatlantic slave trade, I show the women whose ancestors were more exposed to this shock are today more likely to be in the labor force, more politically self-conscious, and politically active. This effect is not present in communities affected by the Indian slave trade, which had a gender-neutral impact. Local cultural transmission of internal norms across generations of women (but not men) in affected ethnicities seems to be the main mechanism explaining this long-run persistence.	Patrick Kuhn

Evidence from Afrobarometer rounds 5 and 6	Women and girls suffer disproportionately from the negative consequences of grand corruption (Hossein et al. 2010). Building on the academic debate whether women differ from men when it comes to engaging in grand and petty corruption, I propose that women care about different policy areas in society than men and therefore participate differently in corruption. Focusing my argument and empirical investigation on the bribe-payer side of petty corruption, I specifically look at three policy areas where men and women can potentially bribe government officials: general government services, school services or the health sector. Using individual level survey data for 34 to 36 countries from the African continent (Afrobarometer Round 5 and 6), the empirical evidence suggests that, on average, women are less frequently involved in petty corruption than men when it comes to general government services but equally corrupt for bribery in the health and education sector. Overall, my empirics support that women are not always corruption cleansers but sometimes also equally engaging in corruption as men.	Natascha Neudorfer

Evidence from a natural experiment in Delhi	I examine whether gender quotas have improved political participation and reduced the gender gap in politics for women in the context of Delhi. I disaggregate and measure political participation in general and context specific ways. I exploit the natural experiment of random quota assignment, where in 50% wards were randomly reserved for women in 2012 and 2017. I embed a two wave panel survey of 1500+ HHs across 18 wards in Delhi within this natural experiment to examine the difference in levels of participation and gender gap between reserved and non-reserved wards. Apart from women's participation and gender gap outcomes, I examine whether quotas were able to mobilise both men and women in the context of anti-corruption protests, anti-rape/ sexual violence and environmental protests that have gripped Delhi since 2012 till date. Lastly, I embed a survey experiment to examine whether being informed about the quota policy as well as gender and quality of the councillor has any effect on perceptions of inclusion and democratic accountability in the political system. I present new results from this original survey.	Tanushree Goyal

We test one of the reasons behind the low turnout rates for women: a lack of information about public service delivery performance of politicians that is aligned with preferences of women. Before the 2018 elections in Pakistan, we randomized electoral areas and ran a political campaign at the household level to inform women voters about the public service delivery performance of the incumbent politician. Our results suggest that women's turnout in the election increased substantially as did the vote share of the incumbent. In a highly competitive environment, where the winning margin is 0.08% of the total polled votes, we find an increase of 13.3% in female turnout and an increase of 5.6% in the vote share of the incumbent politician. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that this response interacts with social norms in the area: women in areas where polling stations are of mixed gender respond strongly to the treatment, whereas women in areas where polling stations are gendered do not.

Before the 2018 elections in Pakistan, we randomized electoral areas and ran a political campaign at the household level to inform women voters about the public service delivery performance of the incumbent politician. Our results suggest that women's turnout in the election increased substantially as did the vote share of the incumbent. In a highly competitive environment, where the winning margin is 0.08% of the total polled votes, we find an increase of 13.3% in female turnout and an increase of 5.6% in the vote share of the incumbent politician. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that this response interacts with social norms in the area: women in areas where polling stations are of mixed gender respond strongly to the treatment, whereas women in areas where polling stations are gendered do not.

Past research has explored how the competitiveness of elections and electoral rules affect the risk of electoral violence, but has neglected that patterns of violence might be quite different in parliamentary versus presidential elections. We argue that the dynamics of subnational electoral competition, and hence incentives for violence, differ in parliamentary versus presidential elections. In parliamentary elections, party elites focus on winning the majority of districts, and therefore center all campaign efforts, including violence on swing and competitive districts. In presidential elections, the country is usually treated as a single electoral district, and elections are decided by winning a majority of votes across districts. Consequently, we expect parties to use violence to deter turnout in the rival party's strongholds. We test the implications of this argument with georeferenced election violence data from ECAV and district-level election data for presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2008. Our findings allow us to define potential hotspots of violence and have important implications for the study of subnational patterns of violence.	Mascha Rauschenbach

Yet, we have surprisingly little understanding about how the quality of these contests influences perceptions of key actors and their incentives for engaging in large-scale violence that escalates to civil war. We argue that electoral integrity moderates the relationship between elections and civil conflict. When the incumbent engages in manipulation or when institutions of election management face problems of bias and incapacity, elections are associated with an increased risk of civil war. This is so, we argue, because low-integrity elections (1) foster grievances that militarized opposition can use to mobilize support and (2) decrease the incumbent’s ability to make credible policy concessions to opposition groups. We assess our hypothesis in a comprehensive sample of developing countries, from 1950 to2012, and find strong support for our expectations. Focusing on executive elections, we find that elections are not associated with civil conflict, on average, but that flawed elections significantly increase the risk of conflict.

Popular “insurance” explanations center on competitive elections: when competition is high, expectations of losing office induce those in power to establish or maintain judicial independence. Despite being predicated on an expected utility calculation, existing research focuses only on variation in the likelihood of losing office, treating the risks of such occurring as constant. This inattention to the actual causal logics of insurance models limits both theoretical development and empirical conclusions. To rectify these two problems, I formalize the expected utility of insurance, integrating both the probability of losing office and its downside risk. I test implications of this model by integrating data on punishment of leaders after leaving office with measures of competition. Furthermore, I develop a plausible instrument for the demand for insurance, thereby offering the first attempt at identification of the causal effect. As such, I advance both our theoretical and empirical understanding of the leading explanatory framework for variation in judicial independence across democracies.	Brad Epperly

A Cross-National Analysis	Understanding how high courts successfully obtain compliance with decisions invalidating government policies poses a puzzle central to the study of constitutional review. An increasingly popular answer to this puzzle is that voters, by virtue of supporting the rule of law and the legitimacy of the judiciary, punish elected officials at the ballot box for failing to faithfully implement judicial decisions. In this paper, I conduct a cross-national analysis of the relationship between noncompliance and an incumbent government's electoral success. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy project on noncompliance with the national high courts of 70 countries from 2007 to 2017, I examine whether voters systematically punish noncompliance. In doing so, I develop a series of hypotheses derived from the judicial legitimacy literature and the literature on factors influencing electoral accountability. The analysis reveals that while an incumbent government's vote share decreases as noncompliance increases, this relationship is conditional on the quality of electoral democracy in a country, the level of noncompliance at the time of the previous election, and single party/multiparty nature of the government.

Legal Context and Political Context in a Machine LearningFramework.	Ex ante forecasting approaches using machine learning become increasingly popular to analyze and predict judicial outcomes. Yet, existing work on the prediction of court decision-making has two important limitations. First, it exclusively focuses on the US Supreme Court. This raises concerns about the external validity of these studies and their implications for courts in different law traditions. Second, none of the existing studies have explicitly tested the relative contribution of legal context versus political context variables to the forecast of court decisions. This study addresses these two points by ex ante predicting over 2,900 decisions of the German Federal Constitutional Court. I find that similar methodological approaches successfully applied to predict Supreme Court decisions also work for Kelsenian European constitutional court types. My results also show that legal context alone is already a good predictor. However, the predictive performance is significantly improved when information about the political context of a decision is added. These findings therefore support the view of a multifaceted decision-making of constitutional courts which is best characterized by the ensemble of both legal and political factors.

Germany is a particularly interesting case for analysis due to the large change in issue salience between the two elections in the wake of the European refugee crisis. We use Structural Topic Models for extracting different interpretations of both terms and analyze whether their meaning has changed between the elections. We find that the term left was interpreted similarly in both elections, but that the meaning of the term right has changed drastically between 2013 and 2017. This change has been particularly strong among left-wing candidates.

Evidence from Two Waves of Open-Ended Survey Questions	Existing evidence on the substantive meaning of the terms 'left' and 'right' usually relies on the analysis of closed survey questions. In this paper, we take a different approach by exploiting the rare case of open-ended survey questions about the meaning of 'left' and 'right' included in candidate surveys of the German national elections of 2013 and 2017. Germany is a particularly interesting case for analysis due to the large change in issue salience between the two elections in the wake of the European refugee crisis. We use Structural Topic Models for extracting different interpretations of both terms and analyze whether their meaning has changed between the elections. We find that the term left was interpreted similarly in both elections, but that the meaning of the term right has changed drastically between 2013 and 2017. This change has been particularly strong among left-wing candidates. We demonstrate that our results have important implications for the context dependency of the interpretation of the left-right scale.	Markus Tepe

Eastern and Western Europe 2002-2016	Lipset et al. (1954), Inglehart (1984) and Bobbio (1996) proposed that the left-right dimension as a measurement of ideology is, at its core, a conflict about equality. However, Thorisdottir et al. (2007) found that while left-wing individuals were more egalitarian than right-wing individuals in Western Europe, the same pattern did not hold in Eastern Europe in 2002. This paper examines this puzzle through two approaches. First, the regression models utilised by Thorisdottir et al. (2007) are replicated with data from the European Social Survey 2002, and subsequent years up to 2016. This analysis shows that the pattern has changed over the years in favour of the egalitarian explanation. Second, Inglehart (1984: 293) proposed that equality as a core component of the left-right dimension often manifests itself through group conflicts, whether based on social class, sex/gender or ethnicity. The results of multilevel regressions demonstrate that left-right self-placements can be explained by policy attitudes towards issues that affect the equality of outcome between groups. While weaker in Eastern Europe, more egalitarian attitudes predict left-wing self-placements in both Eastern and Western Europe.	Jesper Lindqvist

This strategy assumes that voter preferences are cross-nationally linked; for example, that electoral results in the Netherlands offer insight into likely outcomes in Germany by revealing voter preferences. However, the extent to which the preferences are correlated, and why they may be correlated, is unknown. We propose a theory that the ideological preferences of citizens across borders are linked as a result of an increasingly integrated global economy. Since market hiccups, threats to labor value, sector shocks, and others, are increasingly shared across borders so too should their political responses. With the use of the most extensive data collection to date on the preferences of voters, we expect to find greater preference congruence among those in countries with similar economic structures and unifying economic institutions. Our findings reveal that cross-border policy diffusion could be the result of leaders responding in similar fashions to shifting demands by similar electorates, rather than a process of strategic emulation in leaders’ strategies.

Democracy is widely thought to require public support to survive. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is, however, weak with only a handful of tests, all utilizing small cross-sectional samples, and finding contradictory results. The obstacle has been that survey data on democratic support are fragmented across time, space, and survey item. In response, we use a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 26 years. With estimates of opinion now varying over time as well as space, we can use methods of panel data analysis to adjust both for the effects of prior democracy on current support and for unobserved time-invariant confounders such as historical 'critical junctures' which produced both democracy and a supportive political culture. We find that democratic support is positively associated with subsequent democracy. It is, moreover, more robustly linked with the survival of democracy than its emergence in the first place. As Easton hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help democracy survive.	Christopher Claassen

A lack of representation for women and minorities has important consequences for the quality of public goods provision and the bureaucracy's perceived legitimacy. We ask what effect does democratization have on representation patterns in the civil service? We argue that democratization can lead to increased discrimination in the civil service due to the increased politicization of identity cleavages in the political arena. While authoritarian leaders use access to civil service positions to ensure their political survival, they are often insulated from majoritarian demands for discrimination and can resist them when politically expedient. We test this argument using administrative data from Indonesia that covers the full universe of career histories of all 4+ million currently active civil servants. We exploit the exogenous timing of Indonesia's democratization in 1999 and the subsequent staggered introduction of local direct elections, paired with an individual-level difference-in-difference design, for identification purposes. We find strong evidence that democratization worsened the career prospects of female and some religious minority civil servants.	Jan Pierskalla

The literature offers competing claims regarding the effect of the mode of transitions on the duration of post-transitional democracy. This paper reconciles these claims by proposing three modes of democratic transitions – military dominance (MD), popular sanction (PS) and consensual power-transfer (CPT), and arguing CPT leads to subsequent democracies that last longer, followed by PS and then MD. MD fails to incorporate the military into democratic systems, thus making it more likely for ensuing democracies to suffer coups while PS enables regime insiders to change democratic rules without hindrance or enables antecedent insiders to return to power through an organised armed conflict. CPT transforms authoritarian successor parties, which act as the strongest check on the government’s power, thus decreasing the likelihood of collapse. This paper verifies hypotheses using data on nascent democracies between 1945 and 2017, employing a mixed methods research, and thus, contributes to comparative studies of transitional modes of democratisation, and their legacies of military roles, inter-communal conflict, and party dynamics on the longevity of the democracy.

Existing studies on undemocratic regimes and democratization greatly overlook how the ideology of past regimes affects post-transitional party systems, particularly neglecting the specific role of ideology in shaping the ideological landscape of extremism in contemporary party systems. This paper argues that the ideology and the type of undemocratic regime are crucial factors in determining how political systems suppress or exacerbate the emergence of extremist political parties with an ideology akin to the one displayed by the past regime, after democratization. The empirical model shows that while in former totalitarian regimes there are strong extremist parties belonging to the same ideological family as that of the past regime, in authoritarian regimes, which lack a blueprint ideology, the same does not happen. Former authoritarian regimes seem to be immune to extremisms ideologically similar to the one displayed formerly. Lastly, the effect on democratic regimes is neutral.	Catarina Leão

In doing so, it seeksto investigate how the link between labour market vulnerability and anti-immigrant sentiment may be shaped by both resource scarcity (in the economy as a whole) and job scarcity (on the labour market).

First, labour market vulnerability is indeed correlated with more negative beliefs about the economic contribution of immigrants, even controlling for related factors such as education and contract type. Second, this effect appears to be moderated by GDP per capita (though not unemployment rates), with labour market insiders and outsiders holding more distinct attitudes in higher GDP countries; thus, although attitudes towards the economic contribution of immigrants are generally more negative in poorer countries, labour market vulnerability contributes to greater opinion polarization in stronger economies.

Using citizenship data from Switzerland and a synthetic control methodological design, I find that immigrants who live in municipalities without citizenship requirements for participation in canton-level elections are more likely to naturalize in subsequent years than immigrants who do not. These results suggest that, rather than lowering the perceived value of citizenship, the extension of subnational voting rights to non-citizens furthers their political incorporation. I speculate that subnational enfranchisement promotes immigrants’ sense of national belonging and stake in their host country, which, in turn, encourages them to seek full membership in the polity through naturalization.

We, then, ask respondents to evaluate the State's enforcement priorities given these profiles. We find that the deportation preferences vary across countries; while European countries are most likely to prioritize the migrant’s level of integration, Americans focus on the migrant’s criminal history.

The article exploits a natural experiment: the allocation of refugees to municipalities in the rural hinterlands of Eastern Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015. Similar to rural regions elsewhere, the area has seen a major shift towards the political right. The paper relies on an innovative design, in which 1,320 German citizens were sampled from 236 closely-matched municipalities, only half of which received refugees. Survey and behavioral measures show widespread anti-immigrant sentiments and strong support for right-wing parties, but these are not affected by the physical allocation of refugees in a municipality. Our results are corroborated by the analysis of a range of mechanisms related to our outcomes that are left unaffected by local exposure to refugees.

Although growth and income inequality exert direct effects on political attitudes and voting, we argue that their combination induces feelings of deprivation, reduces the levels of trust towards the system of government and, subsequently, enhances the electoral prospects of populist candidates. Our hypothesis is that when the pie grows bigger (increases in GDP growth) but the individual share of the pie doesn’t (income Inequality stays the same or increases), citizens will become more likely to express feelings of deprivation, lower trust towards the system, and thus will be more likely to abandon mainstream parties or candidates for smaller –radical- parties. We test this question using county and state level economic indicators linked with geo-coded public opinion data and actual election results.	Asli Cansunar

However, we also observe growing inequality. This raises the question who wins and who loses from economic development, which is also important for the literature connecting development with political attitudes and behavior. I argue that development affects people differently: while higher development levels offer economic chances for high-skilled individuals, the low-skilled do not reap the same benefits. To evaluate their welfare people compare themselves to others, which yields adverse results for the high-skilled in lagging economic environments and the low-skilled in the most developed areas. I focus on local development, as development levels within countries vary substantially. By combining geo-coded Afrobarometer data and night lights, I am able to measure development levels of people's immediate environments. Bayesian multilevel analysis confirms that high-skilled people are most dissatisfied with their well-being at low levels of economic development. The low-skilled in highly developed environments instead are discontent with living conditions and economic security. This suggests that development does not increase well-being for everyone and points to a potential source of economic grievances and political instability.	Tabea Palmtag

Since the association was first posited by Lijphart (1997), support has been mainly circumstantial. Poorer voters get worse representation (Giger et al., 2012; Gilens, 2012), and are also less likely to participate in elections (Gallego, 2015), but the two phenomena have yet to be directly linked. I build on the pioneering work of Lupu and Warner (2018) by investigating whether turnout disparities between socio-economic groups are associated with representation disparities for the same groups. I rely on an original merged data set of 190 election studies, where voters rate themselves and parties on a Left-Right axis. Using the “Earth Mover’s Distance” (Lupu et al., 2017) as a measure of ideological congruence, I relate this to the income-based or education-based turnout gap, obtained from election-specific turnout models. Preliminary results suggest that turnout disparities explain the overall ideological congruence in the system, but do not explain disparities in congruence between groups. The results open up the possibility that turnout gaps might not be as damaging for representation as first hypothesized.	Constantin Manuel Bosancianu

This paper’s contribution is threefold: (1) extending the theoretical link between inequality and social trust to political trust (2) examining the impact of wealth inequality on subjective orientations, which no study has done before, and (3) taking a global approach to offer a more complete account of the economic and political contingencies that may moderate these relationships. We combine public opinion data from Barometer and Value surveys across 132 countries to assess the relative importance of wealth inequality on social and political trust for different levels of democracy or GDP, while controlling for income inequality to minimize missing variable bias.

How does religion shape Muslims’ redistributive preferences? Although evidence from developed democracies show that religious citizens are less supportive of redistribution, this paper documents the opposite relationship among religious Muslims using a sample of more than 500,000 survey respondents. Religious Muslims express aversion towards income inequality and support for state welfare. Despite that, they also hold negative attitudes towards state taxation. Theoretically, I argue that these seemingly inconsistent attitudes can be explained by the Islamic system of divine rewards and punishment. Islam demands redistribution from followers, independent of state taxation. When religious incentives for redistribution are high, religious citizens shift their resources towards religious redistributive mechanism away from state taxation. I formalize this argument to explain the religious roots of Muslims’ economic policy preferences. Empirically, using a novel identification strategy, I show that changing religious incentives for redistribution leads to a significant rise in support for equality and welfare policies by 7 percent, while decreasing tax compliance by 3 percent among religious Muslims. Finally, the paper outlines implications on public goods provision and state welfare policies in religious societies.	Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed

The increasing tendency of dictators to concentrate personal power has major implications for the political stability of autocracies. However, the nature of this impact is unclear. On the one hand, previous research has highlighted regime personalization as an autocratic survival strategy and linked it to a reduction in the likelihood of coups. On the other hand, dictators’ purges of elite rivals have been linked to an increase in the likelihood of civil war. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings by first developing a common theoretical framework and subsequently testing this framework in a time-series cross-sectional analysis. The paper argues that regime personalization involves a conscious trade-off between different kinds of threats to a dictator’s rule. By increasing the degree of personalization, dictators reduce their vulnerability to elite threats while at the same time increasing their vulnerability to mass-based threats. Consequently, personalist dictators are likely to survive in power unless their rule is destabilized by an exogenous shock (e.g., a regional protest wave) that increases the likelihood of mass-based mobilization.

In recent years we witnessed two interrelated phenomena, the spread of elections around the world (even in non-democracies) and the expansion of election monitoring (intended to improve electoral quality). While we have a relatively good understanding of electoral manipulation, some aspects of election monitoring still need investigation. Electoral observation missions (EOM) do not occur unilaterally, they have to be invited by incumbents. It is unclear though why rulers, particularly those wanting to use electoral manipulation, would be willing to invite monitors and risk receiving a negative report. This paper addresses this question and argues that the decision to invite EOM relates to trade exposure. Incumbents that want to boost trade may need to exhibit to partners that their regime is open to scrutiny and thus have an incentive to invite monitors. This decision reduces rulers’ capacity to cheat, which creates a trade-off between surviving in power by manipulating elections and surviving in power by relying on economic performance. We test this argument empirically with a dataset combining monitoring and trade data in non-established democracies around the world.	Nasos Roussias

These allow dictators to co-opt the opposition, gain international legitimacy, mobilize support bases for the regime and obtain information about regime strength. Against this background, the paper examines how popular mobilization against the regime impacts decisions to hold competitive elections and their outcome. It argues that autocracies are more likely to hold elections when faced with popular mobilization as a mean to release social pressure and in the expectation of reinforcing regime legitimacy. It proposes that nonviolent resistance is more likely to force autocracies to hold competitive elections because of its increased ability to impose governance costs. Further, nonviolent resistance can act as a focal point for uniting the opposition against the regime and lead to leadership changes. Finally, the paper also posits that autocracies’ propensity to hold competitive elections is influenced by regional nonviolent dissent. The empirical analysis uses data on social campaigns from NAVCO 2.0 and elections from NELDA and offers support to these propositions.	Roman-Gabriel Olar

The bifurcated nature of conflict studies, based on the notion that civil and interstate wars are qualitatively different, has so far largely prevented studies from including both types of conflict in the same dataset. Thus, empirical evidence is lacking as to whether the same explanations for longevity apply to both types of conflict, or they are indeed separate phenomena. This paper expands on the Cunningham and Lemke (2013) study on combining civil and interstate wars by including a large number of predictors taken from the rich civil war literature. The proposed framework unpacks the bargaining failure framework into three components governing power projection over distance: material capability, politics, and geography. Using predictive modelling techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble methods, I demonstrate that the majority of predictive covariates of war duration are indeed common to both civil and interstate wars. Further, in most cases, the direction of the effect holds across types, suggesting that the underlying mechanism operates in a similar fashion.	Gokhan Ciflikli

Forecasting Palestinian Attacks on Israel	Do conflict processes exhibit repeating patterns over time? And if so, can we exploit the recurring shapes of the time series to forecast the evolution of conflict? Here we study escalation patterns using recent machine-learning methods derived from information geometry, clustering, and pattern recognition in time series, including geometric-based approaches. Our goal is to supplement typical correlation-based approaches with clustering and prototyping methods to extract shapes and ideally better understand the patterns of escalation into war. We apply these methods to a particularly challenging task: forecasting the precise timing of Palestinian rocket and mortar attacks on Israel. Using four years of minute-level prices for 500 Israeli stocks, we find that financial asset prices react on average 30 minutes ahead of the launch of a rocket. We validate our result in a true out-of-sample manner. Using live market data and minute-level rocket attack data from Israel’s home front command, we publicly broadcast our forecasts in real time for every minute of every day and will continue to do so until the conference, when we will report our results.

However, researchers have been forced to choose between either simple, low performing conceptually-justified models or flexible, high performing black box algorithms. Here we suggest that black box algorithms can be used to improve not only conflict forecasting metrics, but also human understanding (and the formalization) of conflict processes. Using PRIO grid-cell level data, we are able to show how the relative improvements in prediction from a black box model can illuminate missing pieces from existing analytical generative models; suggesting new parameterizations. In particular, we learn that a Bayesian mixture model can close the performance gap with ML models. Our results highlight how advances in machine learning can accelerate social science research on conflict prediction.	Michael Colaresi

Current units of analysis used for quantitative conflict research, such as states, actors’ dyads, and conflict zones fail to track such complex evolutions as they slice them into smaller units. For example, the protracted conflict in the Horn of Africa consists of fights for resources among various clans, Islamist struggles, foreign interventions, and regional power disputes, yet macro-level studies tend to treat these intertwined phenomena as individual conflicts. We provide a more robust methodology by selecting closely related smaller conflicts, the violent actors involved in them, and identifying relevant incidents of violence.

But establishing causal relations with the data typically available is an effort that is plagued by endogeneity concerns, thus restricting the scope of empirical conflict studies. A prominent feature of most theories of conflict is uncertainty, which implies an inherent randomness that is not predictable ex ante to combatants or researchers. Consequently, there may be random variation which can provide a source of exogenous variation for some political and economic outcomes related to conflict. We identify two distinct sources of risk that produce qualitatively different kinds of natural experiments. First, incidence risk is the uncertainty regarding whether a crisis escalates into violence, and arises from private information between potential combatants. Second, result risk arises from imperfect information about the ultimate outcome of conflict, which implies that the initiation of conflict essentially triggers a lottery. We discuss the kinds of natural experiments that emerge from these sources of uncertainty and ways they can (and cannot) be used.	Jessica Sun

Specifically, does being a democracy help or hurt a country's reputation for resolve? To provide new insight into this fundamental question, I directly estimate a state's reputation for resolve by fitting a dynamic game of reputation building to civil conflict data. I find that while governments tend to have stronger reputations for resolve than the rebels they face, democracies are seen as much less likely to be resolved both prior to and during conflict than their autocratic counterparts. Despite this gap, both democracies and autocracies a discrete increase in their reputation for resolve once conflict begins. As such, these findings contrast with a large literature on democratic advantages in interstate conflict while simultaneously providing evidence for audience costs in both democratic and autocratic regimes.

This paper addresses this question by presenting a novel, understudied dynamic and developing a formal model to illustrate the political conditions that influence minority militant mobilization. Marginalized minorities often face the threat of indiscriminate retaliation if any violent transgressions occur from within their community. Low levels of protection from this threat would incentivize minority members to police their group in order to prevent militancy from emerging within their community. The strategic tensions involved in this protection-group policing dynamic occur within the minority group and between the minority group and the state. I thus develop a formal model that investigates how state capacity and state willingness influence minority militant mobilization. Counterintuitively, I use the model to show how a low-capacity state can actually provide an environment that is less conducive to minority-linked militancy than a high capacity state.	Saurabh Pant

This paper considers the strategic rationale and effects of conscription upon intrastate conflict processes. We argue that because conscription alters the outside option of citizens deciding which party to support during civil conflict, it has thus far unrecognized implications for intrastate conflict. In particular, we explore how conscription influences insurgent recruitment, civil conflict initiation, and conflict duration. Using a selectorate model of regime politics, we derive the preferences of ruling elites over military manpower procurement systems subject to budget and insurgency constraints. The military labor market is modeled as a duopsony between a rebel and a standing army with elastic labor supply. Citizen types are divided by civilian productivity and enfranchisement status. While insurgents have no access to the formal economy, the standing army is financed out of tax revenues and the state's ability to conscribe military labor. Optimal levels of conscription are then derived with respect to the level of both the internal and external threat. We illustrate the dynamics of the model with cases of conscription in Syria and Colombia.	Nikitas Konstantinidis

More specifically, external actors can differ in the extent to which they are expected to enforce peace agreements and how noisy that signal is. Actors update their beliefs about the enforcement type based on the initial signal, but also condition their behavior on the other actors’ interpretation of the signal. Very noisy signals can lead to highly heterogeneous responses in conflict networks, which increase the risk of escalation cascades. We propose that belligerents escalate fighting when they believe a mediator will enforce a potential peace agreement. However, less credible but noisy signals by interveners can also lead to the same escalation dynamics.

Community Cohesion after Symmetric and Asymmetric Civil War	Does war affect community cohesion? A common view in the literature is that war increases cohesion among people on the same side of conflict, exacerbating distance between people on the opposite sides. However, conflict sides are not always observable during war. Two types of conflict may vary in this respect – symmetric and asymmetric war. While symmetric war is fought with relatively conventional means between clearly defined camps, in asymmetric war the weaker side adopts guerrilla tactics and boundaries between camps become blurred. In this study, I compare community cohesion in the villages exposed to these two types of conflict, using survey data from 224 Colombian villages. The analysis shows that symmetric war increases cohesion measured as participation in community organizations. By contrast, asymmetric war has a detrimental effect on trusting behaviors. These results support the conjecture that asymmetric war generates denunciation-driven victimization of civilians, contributing to unobservable community fractures.	Krzysztof Krakowski

Existing literature on the topic is limited to a few cases such as Germany's apologies after 1945. Here we address this gap with new data and theory on state apologies. Firstly, we have collected a new dataset that codes, for every war-crime committed in an interstate war during the 20th century, (a) whether an official apology was offered and (b) the characteristics of that apology. Secondly, we use this dataset to explore what factors explain if and when a state offers an apology to another state. In particular, we hypothesize that two political factors, the relative severity of violations between two states (``balance of violations') and domestic political transitions, will determine apology timing. Our statistical analysis and case studies support the view that these political factors explain state apologies better than alternative explanations such as time passed and the relative economic and military power of victims.

Our statistical analysis and case studies support the view that these political factors explain state apologies better than alternative explanations such as time passed and the relative economic and military power of victims.

Peacebuilding practitioners advocate for integration of former insurgents into state security forces as a means to improve security provision in formerly contested areas. This security sector reform introduces a new risk for the government. Integrated former insurgents may use their position inside the security forces to attempt to overthrow the regime. Integration might increase stability by improving security provision or decrease stability by making internal threats more likely. I present a model where a regime screens insurgents, choosing whether to integrate based on the relative magnitude of external and internal threats. While high-skill former insurgents improve the quality of security provision, they are more likely to succeed in taking control of the state. Less capable former insurgents present a lower risk, but are less likely to be effective security providers. The government's own capacity and external pressures influence the tradeoff between these two types. I show this screening process can lead to either power sharing or consolidation of power by an autocrat.	Jessica Sun

An extensive statistical literature suggests that American cities that rioted in the 1960s enjoyed special treatment from local and governments (Fording 1997). In the UK, the 1980s riots highlighted an inequality that continues to this day. We argue that a social policy response is likely in the form of urban regeneration projects and housing, with funds being micro-targeted to the areas where the rioters live. An alternative response is to increase targeted repression, a trade-off echoed in the international relations literature (Moore 1998, 2000; Klein and Regan, 2018). We use reports of riots in both national and local newspapers to code their location and intensity and merge this information with data on local spending patterns that are geographically concentrated, including urban grants and housing redevelopments. We take areas of rioting in London such as Brixton and Tottenham, and use natural experimental cut-offs to generate inferences.	Gabriel Leon, Peter John

The Swing riots and the drivers of social unrest.	Structural factors and contagion are the main drivers of social unrest, but which is more important? To address this question we consider the English Swing riots of 1830-31. The rural nature of the riots and the limited mobility of agricultural workers means that we can use clearly-observable spatial variation in a large number of structural factors to estimate their role in triggering the riots. We then quantify the importance of these factors relative to that of contagion. We find that factors related to the type of agriculture and the capacity for organization were significant in triggering riots, and that contagion on average magnified their impact by a factor of 2.65. Our historical data allow us to address a key question in the conflict literature, while improving our understanding of a period that was critical to the development of British democracy.

Once identified as defectors to an enemy, they may be ostracized, imprisoned, tortured or even killed. Civilian defection has to date been predicated on their relationship to exogenous violent actors, with a focus on collaborators as the outcome of interest. Yet what constitutes defection is construed endogenously, based on a range of accepted and unaccepted behavior, as well as perceptions about where individuals fall within that range. Broad or lax labeling of defection may result in an over-identification of collaborators, and vice-versa. Further, labeling people as defectors has implications for behavior: they may be driven towards conformity in fear of punishment, or “flip” towards defection in acceptance of their label. This paper develops a computational model to account for diverse patterns of defection, and illustrates these mechanisms with anecdotal evidence from the German Democratic Republic and the Palestinian Territories. As a next step, the model is seeded and validated with micro-level data constructed from archival records and interview material.	Mirko Reul

New sub-national evidence from the early 2000s	Despite persistent wide-spread poverty, there is growing recognition that large parts of Africa have seen relatively sustained improvements in economic and social wellbeing. While earlier debates have mostly focused on conceptual issues arising from these developments, such as the problem of defining Africa’s ‘emerging middle classes’, there has been less research on how improving living standards have affected existing status relations between ethnic and religious groups. The paper draws on unusually detailed subnational census and survey data from 6 African countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Zambia), to trace group-specific wellbeing trends at district level for the first decades of the 2000s. The resulting evidence is combined with existing measures of groups’ access to political resources from the Ethnic Power Relations database and geocoded information on local conflict events (ACLED), to test theories of relative deprivation/ethnic grievance in the ethnic conflict literature. Groups’ socio-economic status is defined by education, occupation, and household assets. The paper also draws on historical conflict data and Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas to address endogeneity concerns and to distinguish short-term from long-term effects.	Frank-Borge Wietzke

Experimental Evidence from a UN Women's Program in South Central Somalia.	As formal institutional change is often slow or unrealistic, scholars and policymakers have sought to produce positive change via informal institutional alternatives. However, while strengthening informal institutions may produce better outcomes overall, justice for marginalized groups may worsen if informal institutions reinforce existing inequalities. We conduct a RCT to evaluate a U.N. program that aims to increase justice for women in conflict-ridden South Central Somalia by targeting norms, attitudes and behaviors of traditional community powerbrokers from 40 villages with weak formal institutions: women leaders, and religious and clan elders who preside over the informal justice system. This ongoing intervention spanning 9 months teaches participants methods of non-violent communication (NVC). Through role-plays, mixed gender sessions, and interactive activities, participants determine how to apply NVC generally and specifically to the provision of customary justice for women in their communities, particularly regarding domestic violence. Participants are then trained as NVC facilitators to disseminate learnings to existing institutions and to non-leaders in villages. Administrative data, text-as-data analysis, behavioral measures, lab-in-the-field and survey experiments supplement baseline and endline surveys with over 800 leaders and non-leaders.	Nicholas Haas

Personalization entails the progressive accumulation of power in the hands of the dictator so that the influence of other organized elites is minimized. However, members of the support group have incentives to act against the dictator to avoid being marginalized by personalistic strongmen. I argue that personalism increases the risk of coups in the short-term, but passed a certain level of power accumulation the risk of coups decreases since rulers establish personal control over the security forces and the state apparatus. However, wwhile the risk of coups is reduced, the risk of assassination attempts increases, as this is a rebellion tool that requires lower levels of coordination and smaller number of plotters. since the overall risk of being assassinated is lower than that of being ousted in a coup, personalization is proved to be survival-efficient.To test these hypotheses, new data on personalism by Geddes et al. (2018) is used as well as data on coup and assassination attempts.	Abel Escribà-Folch

In this paper, we identify a new mechanism through which statebuilding leads to violence. We argue that statebuilding is more likely to cause violence when it succeeds, specifically, when it succeeds in reducing social hierarchies between historically repressed and privileged communities. Effective reductions to long-standing social inequities trigger resentment, anxiety and violence among privileged communities leading to vi- olence against repressed communities. Furthermore, because historically repressed communities work to institutionalize and preserve socio-economic gains arising from statebuilding interven- tions, such gains in status, as well as violence in response to them, persist over the long-term. We quantitatively test our arguments using historical, county-level data on post-U.S. Civil War Reconstruction and we supply both quantitative and qualitative evidence for our mechanisms.

However, empirical evidence on this has been inconclusive and often conflicting. This is because political instability has often been measured through violent acts of civil wars or revolutions. However, using instances of violence to determine terrorist emergence leads to an overlap between the dependent and independent variables. This paper diverges from the existing literature by looking into non-violent indicators of instability that might lead terrorism. In particular, it looks at the interaction between political instability and the opportunities that encourage terrorism. The research argues that political instability is a clear manifestation of the politicization of discontent, and when combined with the opportunities for violence, it has the potential to drive individuals and groups towards terrorism. In order to investigate these claims, the study uses Large-N quantitative analysis for over 130 countries from 1971-2011. The results point towards the importance of certain combinations of factors, such as that of low regime durability and low quality of governance and that of coups and terrorist attacks in neighbours.

This paper goes beyond the size of the national military and conceptualizes repressive state capacity as a state’s ability to encircle potential minority rebels with an ethno-national population allegiant to the central government. It argues that encirclement can isolate potential rebels from personnel and information transfer across international and domestic borders, and from executing successful retreat in case of an armed confrontation with the government. To test the theory, I compiled a novel dataset on 100 counties and 174 state-sponsored Han Chinese settlements (i.e. bingtuan) in Xinjiang, China. I find that counties surrounded by bingtuan settlements from multiple directions that form an encirclement are associated with significantly fewer violent minority insurgencies. Counties simply having a larger number of Han settlements have not seen fewer violent incidents. The results are robust to controlling for a variety of economic, demographic, and bureaucratic conditions. The paper highlights the sophistication, as opposed to the size, of national security forces in affecting civil conflict onset.	Anna Zhang

Yet, current conceptualizations of state capacity typically focus only on the state and ignore the relational nature of armed conflict. We argue that conflict arises where relational state capacity is low, that is, where the state has less control over its subjects than local, oftentimes ethnic elites. This occurs in ethnic groups that are poorly accessible from the state capital, but internally highly interconnected. To test this argument, we digitize detailed road maps of Africa, and convert them into a road atlas akin to Google Maps. We measure the accessibility and internal connectedness of groups via travel times obtained from this atlas. To address the endogeneity, we use an instrumental variable design based on road network simulations. We find that low relational state capacity is a key determinant of armed conflict in Africa.

Examining International Support for Coups d'État	Over the last decades, a global anti-coup norm emerged, denouncing coups d’état as despicable and inacceptable violations of democratic principles. Many states and international organizations on the global and regional level have adopted far-reaching anti-coup policies, responding to coups with condemnations, diplomatic and economic sanctions. However, not all coups seem to evoke negative reactions: Sometimes, violent take-overs are condoned, welcomed or even actively supported by external actors. Are there “good coups”, take-overs worth to praise rather than to criticize? Which factors drive positive international reactions to coups? Drawing on a unique and novel dataset on international reactions to 133 coup attempts between 1990 and 2017 the paper explores and analyzes patterns of positive reactions to coups with advanced quantitative methods. The results indicate that major violations of democratic principles and human rights, hostility between the ousted government and third-country states as well as ethnic and religious ties are key factors for positive international reactions to coups. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings for a more nuanced policy approach towards coups d’état.	Franziska Hohlstein

We focus on the interaction between leaders and dissident challengers – who can generate governance costs through non-compliance “from below” – as well as leaders and rival elites, who may create risks of opportunism and challenges to leaders “from within”. We examine in detail how the type of dissident and magnitude of participation influences the likely effects on threats to undermine rulers directly and the risk of challenges from other elites. We argue that non-violent challenges will tend to be more threatening to a leader’s risk of exit than violent challenges, since the magnitude of the challenge increases in the scale and size of the dissident campaign, and nonviolent have a potential for much larger mobilization than violent challenges. We analyze these propositions empirically using data on political leaders as well as dissident campaigns and their characteristics, and find support for our expectations.	Marius Radean

Using an actor-centric perspective, this study uncovers the puzzle why some leaders stay in power while others do not. I argue that prior military and political experience are decisive for political survival. While military experience is beneficial for asserting power in times of threats (e.g., in the immediate aftermath or coups), political experience has a greater impact, the longer the post-war incumbent stays in power. I further expect this effect to be stronger for civil wars that ended in a draw than for those that were won with a decisive victory; in the latter case, the leader is in an advantaged position as post-war compromises are minimized. I test my argument using cross-national data supplemented with biographical information on political leaders for the period between 1946 and 2004. My study presents a novel perspective to analyze the determinants of leadership survival in post-conflict scenarios and contributes to an improved understanding of political dynamics and stability in post-civil war countries.

We theorize that democracies fighting other democracies continue fights they ultimately lose because domestic audience costs in both democratic states encourage democracies to delay the audience costs that come with defeat.

What influences the size of states’ personnel contributions to UN peacekeeping missions? One common explanation is the risk of casualties among the own ranks states face in these missions. I argue that the interest of political and military elites in a successful accomplishment of the mission, to signal strength and reliability internationally, frequently outweighs these concerns. UN peacekeeping missions are characterized by a rare occurrence of casualties among UN personnel as well as their low relevance domestically. Existing explanations that are derived from contexts of war and solely focus on domestic politics are therefore less important. This new theoretical argument is tested using highly disaggregated data on country-specific casualties and contributions in UN missions between 1990 and 2011. It is the first study that uses such fine-grained data on casualties for the analysis of personnel contributions for UN peacekeeping missions. My preliminary results show a significant increase in states’ contributions when facing casualties. This finding helps to clarify the mixed results in current research on peacekeeping missions and has policy-implications for the planning and organization of UN peacekeeping missions.	Felix Olsowski

But, UN aims do not always coincide seamlessly with the priorities of troop contributing countries. While financial incentives may motivate troop contributions, peacekeepers likely see risk differently from those that fund operations, and domestic publics may politically punish TCC leaders for peacekeeper casualties. In this study, we ask two questions. First, are troop contributing countries with certain characteristics more willing than others to deploy to spaces in post-conflict environments with higher-than average one-sided violence against civilians? Second, irrespective of where troops are deployed, are particular TCCs more effective in reducing one-sided civilian violence? We look at the attributes of troop contributing countries such as GDP, military expenditures, and combat experience to assess decision-making and effectiveness in responding to and treating violence in post-conflict countries.

Without an explicit focus on the different levels of autonomy, little can actually be said about the impact of territorial self-governance arrangements. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the Territorial Self-Governance data set (TSG), which offers unique and innovative data on self- and shared-rule indicators of autonomy regimes in 47 countries with 169 regions over the period 1950-2016 across the world. With this data, it is now possible to move beyond the analysis of mere aggregated information on territorial self-governance and investigate instead the specific institutional design of such arrangements and their impact on the risk of violent civil conflict. A first analysis reveals that the effect of territorial self-governance regimes on civil conflict is indeed sensitive to the level of autonomy. This main finding emphasizes the necessity for in-depth analyses of different levels of autonomy and interaction effects between different self- and shared-rule indicators for conflict prevention.

ETH Zurich, Switzerland	p	86256	881	Dangerous precedents? Border change, spillover and new territorial disputes.	A common concern in International Relations is that territorial changes in one region may destabilise borders elsewhere, by setting precedents that encourage further actors to challenge the status quo. Despite the importance of this claim, it has not yet been tested empirically. This paper thus examines how border changes affect the risk of new interstate territorial disputes elsewhere. While international rules generally impose strong constraints on territorial revisionism, the enforcement of these rules can vary across time and space, and is in many cases uncertain. Would-be revisionist states base their choice to initiate a dispute in part on the observed behaviour of other, proximate states. Successful border changes nearby demonstrate the weakness of international constraints, suggesting favourable conditions for revisionism. Therefore, regional border instability increases the risk of dispute initiation. Using new data on border changes since 1886 and data on interstate territorial disputes, I find that previous regional border changes are indeed associated with the initiation of new disputes by third states. Moreover, this effect is largely driven by conflictual instances of border change that violate territorial integrity norms.	Guy Schvitz

Currently, the literature assumes that access to domestic financial services is spatially and temporally constant and thus inconsequential to conflict processes. In this paper, we relax this assumption by developing a theoretical framework that links the differential access to financial institutions to the likelihood of violent conflict. By providing financial risk management services, financial institutions can reduce economic grievances and thus the risk of conflict. On the other hand, access to financial institutions can also increase the risk of conflict since they may represent a “honeypot” for opportunists and facilitate rebel funding. We argue that the ability of a state in protecting and monitoring financial institutions can strengthen the former effect and mitigate the latter one. We evaluate our hypotheses using georeferenced data across different datasets at different aggregation levels. Our results show that the pacifying and provocative effects of financial institutions on conflict are conditional the local capacity of governments.	Babak RezaeeDaryakenari

Recent literature explores rebel group funding, but less is known about how states finance their civil war efforts. During international wars, countries with central banks borrow capital at lower costs. However, it is not clear how monetary institutions influence civil war dynamics. Civil wars alter both the domestic incentives to use monetary policy, and monetary institutions’ international credibility in ways that may differ from international wars. This paper studies how central bank independence (CBI) affects the government’s ability to finance civil conflict, and thus, civil war termination. Statistical analyses on a sample of civil conflicts between 1970 and 2009 show that CBI is associated with higher likelihood of conflict termination. When the form of termination is disaggregated, (higher) CBI is associated with a higher probability of government victory, and with a lower probability of rebel victory. Regarding mechanisms, the evidence suggests that CBI is associated with better conditions in credit markets, and with lower inflation in countries experiencing civil wars.	Ana Carolina Garriga

Thus, governments have an incentive to extract revenue in ways in which they receive no blame or are generally unnoticed by the public. Historically, governments have been able to extract revenue through regulation of the banking industry. While this can be crucial for raising revenue, these market distortions can hinder a state’s long-run economic development. This paper uses data on domestic banking activity to examine how security threats result in the funneling of private deposits to government coffers via rent seeking. I find that several measures of external threat and internal strife are associated with greater allocation towards the domestic sector and, also, broader measures of financial development. The paper suggests that historical patterns persist in modern economies. More importantly, the findings have implications for how we understand the relationship between security and economic development but also the manner in which states to fund security both at home and abroad.

Combining this information with details from three Afrobarometer survey rounds, our analysis reveals a pivotal role of local institutions in the form of communal councils: respondents living in areas hosting oilfields with increased public shares are more likely to protest and endorse political violence – if they express dissatisfaction with the councils. This negative effect is reversed once institutions are perceived to be responsive towards citizens’ needs.	Mario Krauser

It would therefore seem intuitive that including identity concessions, such as language rights, cultural rights or the right to religion, in a peace agreement would contribute to a stable peace, yet we know little about whether this is the case. This article examines a database of peace agreements from conflicts with ethnic aims from 1990 to 2015 and examines when identity rights are included in a peace agreement and under what conditions the satisfaction of identity demands can impact on peace stability. Taking into account selection effects, the preliminary results show that the granting and implementation of such rights increases peace stability, with an effect that is independent of that of the political settlement. The paper thus contributes to research on the role of grievances in civil wars and the use of violence and the findings have important policy implications.	Lesley-Ann Daniels

Presenting the PA-X Corpus	The Peace Agreement Database and Dataset provides a full record of formally negotiated and signed peace agreement documents, for the 1990-2015 period (www.peaceagreements.org). In addition to its potential for use as a qualitative and quantitative data resource, it will soon be available as a corpus of texts suitable for computer-based text analysis. The PA-X Corpus is currently under development (expected completion in February 2019) and consists of ~1800 documents across multiple stages of negotiations, from pre-negotiations, when the warring sides are talking about how to approach the peace process, to ceasefires and comprehensive agreements. The data encompass agreements relating to both interstate and intrastate conflict. In this paper, I provide an overview of the data resource and demonstrate the potential for its use in various strands of political science research. In particular, I examine the differences in language found across the texts from peace processes with varying levels of third-party involvement, attempting to ascertain whether the third-party preferences correlate with the most pronounced topics in peace process negotiations.

University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom	p	86249	877	Peace agreement effectiveness and quality of post-war elections	Peace agreements often prescribe the holding of elections, as more than 20% of all peace agreement documents include at least some mention of elections. Relying on peace agreements data collected in the Peace Agreements Database and Access Tool (PA-X), I test the connection between existence of peace agreements tackling elections and orderliness of post-war elections. I argue that peace agreement documents are not just dead letters: they at the very least indicate that the warring sides are not opposed to being associated with some agreed point, and in the best-case scenario they may even indicate the willingness to commit to a particular course of action.The experience of repeated mentions of elections in peace agreements will create greater expectations for the elections when they are held, and greater costs of holding poor-quality elections for all parties involved. I find that the increasing number of peace agreements mentioning elections does correlate with higher quality of elections that are actually held, and higher probability of protest when the promise of free and fair elections is not upheld.

We apply topic models to the corpus of peace agreements and discover abstract topics that correspond to dominant issues discussed in each agreement. We analyze the relationship between the issues negotiated in the agreement and the likelihood of the agreement’s successful implementation. Across different peace agreements we also explore how the salience of negotiated issues changes over time. Having examined peace agreements with regards to actors and their objectives, enforcement, and mediation, our preliminary findings suggest that peace agreements covering a broader range of topics tend indeed to last longer; secessionist conflicts end in a more stable peace; mediators do not prolong the longevity of peace agreements, and the promise of external enforcement has no effect on the duration of peace.

Since conflict disrupts existing social structures, women often take over high-level economic and political positions during the civil war. What is not known, however, is whether women are able to hold on to these leadership positions after the end of conflict and whether a civil war thus leads to a lasting change in the power dynamic. Utilizing a unique data set of female political leaders in post-civil war countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we empirically examine whether the existence and severity of a conflict leads to increases in the number of women in political leadership positions in the post-civil war period and their ability to retain long-term power. Our findings indicate that post-civil war situations promote an increased number of female political leaders. This research has implications both for the understanding of post-civil war situations and for the conditions under which women attain broad political power.	Britt Bolin

The ostensible rigidity and salience of identity has been repeatedly demonstrated throughout the many episodes of violence, with emphasis placed on ethnicity. Yet, the boundaries between these groups have not always been as rigid as suggested. Scholars have highlighted numerous instances of intermixing, as different ethnicities lived alongside each other and intermarried. Yet, more notable instances of Hutu and Tutsi switching ethnicities have largely been ignored. In this paper, we assess the degree of identity elasticity—fluidity driven by demand, supply and cost—in Rwanda and Burundi in an effort to counter the notion that identities were immutable and explore the implications of fluidity/rigidity for violence. We adapt Akerlof’s (2000) analysis, which specifies a utility function of identity as a motivation for behaviour, to demonstrate why certain historical moments were characterised by greater or lesser fluidity, and that rigid ethnic boundaries are not evidenced at the outset of episodes of inter-ethnic violence.

The main problem in the study of the consequences of wartime sexual violence is under-reporting due to feelings of shame, guilt or fear. We overcome this limitation by presenting the results of a list experiment embedded in a representative survey in Sri Lanka, which is recovering from an ethnic civil war between Singhalese and Tamils. Importantly, we connect this indirect measure of experiencing sexual violence during war to individual post-conflict political participation. We find that experiences of sexual violence have a strong mobilizing effect among survivors. In terms of causal mechanisms, we rule out selection arguments and the notion of post-traumatic growth. Instead, increased political activism seems to be a rational response to cope with the experience of sexual violence during war. Our finding has important implications for policy and the political prospects of post-conflict societies.	Richard Traunmueller

In the wake of such events, governments may attempt to address these past crimes by employing elements of transitional justice, such as trials, truth and reconciliation commissions, reparations, lustration and vetting procedures, exiles, and/or amnesties. Because these mechanisms are designed to increase respect for human rights and the rule of law, it is widely assumed that states that implement them will do a better job of protecting minority rights than states that fail to implement them. The literature has yet to evaluate this belief, however, and so our paper puts this unexamined assumption to the test by analyzing quantitative data on transitional justice mechanisms and minority rights in Europe and Latin America between 1970 and 2007. By showing how the use of transitional justice is linked to subsequent respect for minority rights, we offer the first quantitative assessment of how well transitional justice performs in accomplishing one of its main goals: safeguarding the rights of vulnerable populations.

Environmental events could force millions of people to leave their homes. This mass movement of individuals could strain resources and affect communal cohesion in receiving areas, which may lead to insecurity and conflict. Yet, we have limited understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying these processes as well as empirical evidence. We examine the relationship between environmental change, migration to urban areas, and conflict. We contend that conflict is more likely to occur when migration is triggered by long-term (droughts) than short-term environmental events (floods). Migrants having experienced long- term environmental events are more likely to suffer from grievances that induce conflict perceptions and urbanites perceive these migrants as competitors for public services and jobs. We empirically analyze this argument with newly collected micro-level data comprising more than 3,500 migrants and urbanites from three cities in Vietnam. The results support our proposition and emphasize that local socio-economic/institutional conditions matter for the emergence of conflict.	Vally Koubi

Recent research uses climate and price variation to identify effects of economic shocks on conflict. Beyond opportunity cost and rapacity mechanisms, the causal channels and scope conditions remain elusive. In this paper, I show that agriculture-related conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa is about more than income fluctuations or economic vulnerability to weather shocks. Instead, local conflict is most likely where a historically inherited mix of communal governance and ethnic diversity fuels ethnic competition between “sons of the soil” and in-migrating “ethnic strangers”. Such conditions tend to prevail in areas that have produced export crops from the colonial age onward. I use fine-grained geospatial data on historical resource production, conflict events, weather shocks, world market prices, and local-level ethnic demography to test my argument. Preliminary findings suggest that economic downturns have stronger conflict-inducing effects in more “modern” cash crop regions than in other areas that depend on agriculture. These effects are driven by ethnically heterogeneous cash crop zones, indicating that agricultural conflict in Africa has an identity component that remains underappreciated in the quantitative literature.

Pastoral communities are among the first casualties of hydroelectric dams due to their strong dependence on changing ecosystems for their livelihoods. Moreover, previous research suggest that temperature and precipitation variability increase tensions between pastoral groups. We argue that pastoral communities in the region may experience a “double whammy” from hydroelectric dams and a changing climate by increasing the risk of violent events. We employ a multilevel model across local Ethiopian and Kenyan administrative units from 1990 to 2013. While we find that the frequency of pastoral violence decreases in level-2 administrative units with a hydroelectric dam, we also find some evidence of a double whammy effect. We find some evidence that the effect of warmer than average years on the risk of pastoral conflict is amplified in level-2 administrative units with a hydroelectric dam.	Alfonso Sanchez

Claims for harder border controls and travel bans have become a divisive political issue. Strikingly, however, evidence on the impact of refugee inflows and border control on terrorist violence is scarce. In this paper we examine the impact of refugee inflows and policy on two different forms of terrorism: against host populations and refugees themselves. We rely on two empirical strategies. First, we draw on a novel and extensive time series cross-sectional dataset covering 35 OECD countries over 15 years, including refugee policies and the incidence of various types of terrorism. Second, we conduct a difference in differences analysis assessing the impact of Germany’s sudden and salient pro-refugee policy approach in 2015. Our preliminary analyses suggest that refugee inflows and restrictive border controls have insignificant effects on attacks against host populations by transnational terrorist groups. However, permissive refugee policies increase attacks against refugee populations. We explore the economic, cultural and political threat mechanisms behind our findings with a georeferenced dataset of anti-refugee violence in Germany.	Sergi Pardos-Prado

We argue that to avoid electoral defeat governments may implement more restrictive migration policies during times of high terrorism risk to signal political resolve to an electorate that dislikes the fear and economic instability that are associated with terrorism. We find that an increased perception of transnational terrorism risk leads to stricter migration controls but does not affect general migration policy. We show that this finding holds for different operationalization of terrorism risk and when endogeneity is accounted for. Furthermore, we provide some evidence that the nexus between terrorism risk perception and immigration policy changed after the end of the Cold War, potentially as transnational terrorism by Islamist groups (which tends to be more bloody and directed at civilian targets) became more prominent.

Impact of Jihadist attacks on the perception of discrimination among Muslims	A growing strand of the literature analyzes the causal impact of terrorism on discriminatory attitudes. But how does it feel to be Muslim in the aftermath of terror events? This question is largely unanswered, possibly because minorities in society are minorities in data-sets. Exploiting exogenous variation in terror threat, we compare the perceived discrimination on relevant dimensions (race, religion) against placebo dimensions (gender, sexuality) of the relevant minority (Muslims) against placebo minorities (non-Muslims out-group) before and after six different terror attacks in six different countries studied as “natural experiments”. The most important result is that terrorism causes a “substitution effect” in perceived race-relations. Jihadist attacks increase perceived racial discrimination among Muslims, who generally perceive lower racial discrimination, and decrease perceived racial discrimination among non-Muslims, who generally perceive higher racial discrimination. This effect takes place for racial discrimination only, and not for religious, nationality or language based discrimination. Jihadist terrorism seems to increase the alignment of non-Muslim minorities with the in-group: not only they report lower perceived discrimination, but also, unlike Muslims, they significantly increase their own anti-immigration attitudes.

However, new evidence shows that there is more violence perpetrated against refugees than violence perpetrated by refugees against host states. This paper identifies when host states are more likely to violate the physical integrity of their refugee populations. We argue that violence against refugees tends to increase during election periods, as leaders act on incentives to foster xenophobia and construct more exclusive notions of group identity to boost their own prospects at the polls. In addition, refugees without electoral power are strategically attractive targets of violence for leaders who aim to deflect criticism and maintain power. We provide a multi-pronged approach to test our conjecture, supplementing a large-N cross-sectional analysis using new data on violence against refugees with sub-national geo-spatial analysis of elections and violence in sub-Saharan Africa during the period 2000 to 2010. The findings provide evidence for our expectations and have implications for the international community’s current delegation of refugee protection to host governments.	Burcu Savun

We address this question through a large-scale field intervention conducted in 31 cities across three German states, designed to measure assistance provided to immigrants during everyday social interactions. This randomized trial found that cultural integration signaled through shared social norms mitigates--but does not eliminate--bias against outgroups driven by perceptions of ethno-religious differences.

If so, to what extent can institutions alleviate such negative consequences? Existing studies have found support for the link between conflict-induced migration and armed conflict. However, migratory responses related to slow- or rapid-onset natural hazards and possible mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects are less well understood. Using geo-referenced data on people displaced by natural hazards and various types of conflict in Southeast Asia, this paper employs statistical network analysis to explore the role of institutions in the relationship between migration and conflict. Network analysis allows for modelling interdependencies between areas of migratory origin and destination, therefore more accurately depicting the complexity of decisions to migrate. The paper aim to further the discussion on hazard-induced migration and conflict by examining the impact of political institutions and public policies in areas of origin and destination.

Theories of empathy-driven altruism suggest that violence can increase people’s ability to empathize and that experiences of violence can create identities the bridge political divides. We test this theory in the context of the Syria civil war with data from over 1500 Syrians living in North and South Syria in 2017. We find that Syrians who experiences more violence and displacement during the conflict discriminate less against members of other sects and are more open to helping vulnerable IDPs. However, preferences for helping others are still shaped by sectarian identity and the political dynamics unfolding during conflict. Our findings show that violence does not necessarily lead to greater antagonism toward outgroups, as is often assumed, but that politics shapes generosity during war.	Alexandra Hartman

In other words, existing research has assumed that the main determinants of internal and external displacement are the same. In this paper, I challenge the general understanding and argue that refugee and IDPs flows have distinct causes in civil conflicts. Civilians might be subject to direct violence as warring parties need to fund their activities and to put pressure on and cut the support for the rival. Depending on the perpetrator, government or rebels, the effect of violence on displacement varies. If rebels perpetuate violence, the number of IDPs increases because by fleeing conflict zone within the country, people can escape from rebel violence. However, if the perpetrator is government, we see an increase in the number of refugees, because to escape from government violence, people may have to leave their country. A regression analysis of civil conflicts between 1989 and 2016 and out-of-sample cross-validation corroborate my expectations.	Oguzhan Turkoglu

In this paper, I argue that civil conflicts in which rebels hold territorial control generate more displaced people than others. Under rebel control, civilians experience more social and economic pressure in addition to violence. For their activities, rebels collect heavy taxes and resort to extortion as well as forced recruitment. They may also limit the foreign aid to the conflict zone. In addition, rebels may prohibit social activities (e.g., cinema and internet) and introduce new rules (e.g., making hijab compulsory and banning shaving beards). In other words, civilians face more problems in territories under rebel control. To test my argument, I analyze civil conflicts between 1989 and 2011 (because of data availability). Both in-sample regression analysis and out-of-sample cross-validation corroborate my expectation. To elaborate the causal claim further, I employ the conflict between the Yemen government and Houthis as a quantitative case study. Both synthetic control and differences-in-differences analyses support my argument.	Oguzhan Turkoglu

Why do some conflicts diffuse and others do not? Previous research has mainly focused on transnational diffusion and few studies have analysed its sub-national dimension. While scholars have studied the role of country-level covariates, conflict processes has been largely overlooked. Yet, as shown by the literature on the micro-foundations of civil war, the latter are pivotal determinants that shape the unfolding of conflict. Types of violence, nature of the actors and tactical considerations influence subsequent instances of sub-national conflict. I show that reactive violence is linked to the spatial variation of conflict and to horizontal escalations in proximate areas. Accordingly, I bridge the theories of deterrence and alienation to population-centric warfare deriving testable implications on “quality” and “quantity” of violence. Firstly, I propose that diffusion is amplified by violence against civilians in adjacent spatial units through reactive violence. Secondly, I propose a link between deterrence and alienation-based explanations relying on the number of civilian fatalities. I test these hypotheses conducting a dis-aggregated analysis on a sample of spatial-cell/month observations covering the African continent from 1997 to 2014.	Andrea Salvi

Previous studies have demonstrated that governments may increase violations of physical integrity rights in response to terrorist and rebel violence committed by groups. This paper argues that increasing competition between groups signals an acute threat to the government's authority, especially when this competitive behavior is public. Observable competition between groups indicates a higher level of commitment than when such groups operate independent of one another. As a result, the government is more likely to increase its violation of physical integrity rights. Using original data on intergroup rivalries in African countries, we find that governments are likely to engage in higher levels of physical integrity rights violations and torture in response to increasing competition - and especially, competitive violence - between militant groups.

Previous studies have demonstrated that governments may increase violations of physical integrity rights in response to terrorist and rebel violence committed by groups. This paper argues that increasing competition between groups signals an acute threat to the government's authority, especially when this competitive behavior is public. Observable competition between groups indicates a higher level of commitment than when such groups operate independent of one another. As a result, the government is more likely to increase its violation of physical integrity rights. Using original data on intergroup rivalries in African countries, we find that governments are likely to engage in higher levels of physical integrity rights violations and torture in response to increasing competition - and especially, competitive violence - between militant groups.

As disaggregated data is sparse, we know little about the exact spatio-temporal pattern of mass protests and underlying diffusion channels. Recent accounts speculate that relational channels, like social networks, are more important for protest diffusion in autocracies than non-relational channels, like foreign media. I advance this debate by providing a discriminate perspective on information effects. While information in relational channels is qualitatively better and more trustworthy, information by non-relational channels reaches a larger share of the society. Additionally, informational value may differ for citizens depending on the municipality size of their home town. The results lower exceptions about the importance of relational channels for protest diffusion. Using new geo-referenced data on the day-municipality level on protests in East Germany in 1989, I find no overall effect of spatially close protests on subsequent protest propensity, which questions a strong effect of local networks. However, I find evidence for spatial protest contagion among smaller municipalities. Moreover, large centres exhibit a pull effect as protest in larger cities decrease protest propensity in spatially proximate smaller municipalities.	Katrin Paula

Insights from Nigeria	The past decade has seen large numbers of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempt to reach Europe irregularly along the dangerous 'Mediterranean route,' a trend that is projected to increase in coming decades (Hanson and McIntosh 2016). In response, European governments have invested heavily in initiatives to deter irregular migration, including an explosive expansion of information campaigns designed to inform potential migrants about the dangers of the journey and the unwelcoming reception they might receive in Europe (Schans and Optekamp 2016). There is surprisingly little evidence about whether such campaigns accomplish their stated objectives, and whether potential migrants actually are misinformed about the costs of the journey and the benefits of Europe. We provide such evidence from a representative survey we conducted in Benin City, the epicenter of irregular migration out of Nigeria, which is itself the largest sub-Saharan African source of irregular migrants to Europe. We find that potential migrants in this context are better informed about destination contexts than European information campaigns assume, but are poorly informed about the journey itself, and we discuss correlates of migration-related knowledge.

Evidence from a survey experiment in Ghana.	Building on recent work concerning the impact of attribution on accountability, we investigate whether information about policy attribution influences candidate selection. Selection is a key component of electoral accountability, and is incorporated in some way in all recent accountability models (Ashworth 2012). Campaign promises provide information about potential future performance that can affect expectations about what policies will be chosen, and provide a benchmark for future performance evaluation (Aragones et al. 2010). It is reasonable therefore to think that voters will be more likely to condition selection on promises concerning attributable policy outcomes, for which effort in office can be evaluated more effectively. Using a survey experiment in Accra, Ghana, we randomize the provision of systemic information concerning responsibility for education outcomes, in order to evaluate its impact on citizens' concern for education policy. We use conjoint analysis to measure the extent to which education promises influence the selection of candidates in District Assembly elections.	Robin Harding

When preferences of political elites diverge from those of citizens, which set of preferences drives a final decision? Questions relating to disparities in elite responsiveness have recently constituted a fruitful avenue of investigation (Einstein and Glick 2017; Meng et al. 2017; Öhberg and Naurin 2015; Truex 2016). We answer these questions by leveraging a set of 140 consultative sessions between 1,050 citizens and local political elites in Kampala, Uganda, as an arena of preference divergence (Humphreys et al. 2006). To overcome self-selection biases, we randomize both citizens’ and elites’ participation to specific meetings, and incentivize citizen attendance (Sheely 2015) to reduce socio-economic biases in groups. With information about citizens’ and elites’ preferences collected via pre- and post-meeting surveys we are able to assess differential responsiveness. Finally, with a series of voting rounds inside the meeting, we are able to assess which preferences are dominant over the final decision. Our conclusions have the potential to highlight biases in consultative processes that are in widespread use at the local level in developing countries.	Constantin Manuel Bosancianu

However, less is known about the conditions under which conflict is most likely to change local ethnic demography. I argue that violence increases ethnic segregation where the costs of leaving an ethnically diverse locality are high. Because people are less willing to leave ethnically diverse localities endowed with resources or access to markets, violence is most likely to produce ethnic segregation in high-value localities. When ethnic groups are equally capable of remaining in a desirable locality, violence will be more likely to increase segregation. Using estimates of ethnic composition based on voter registers from before and after Kenya's 2007 post-election crisis, I demonstrate that segregation has increased where violence occurred. I also show that conflict produced the most segregation in high-value locations, particularly those where ethnic groups have more equal population shares.	Kimuli Kasara

The remnants of informal wartime institutions form a key challenge for governments in post-conflict societies in their attempts to re-establish themselves as legitimate authorities. So-called ‘punishment attacks’ in Northern Ireland offer insights into the relationship between informal justice systems and state legitimacy in post-conflict societies.

Efforts to reform the police continue to be challenged by groups that impose social control through violent attacks in their communities. The paper combines historical analysis, interviews with relevant stakeholders, systematic local-level data on in-group violence and other indicators of social control, as well as survey data on people’s perceptions of both informal and formal authorities to understand how and to what extent wartime orders continue to shape social control in fringes of post-war society.

We only have a limited understanding of how rebel-to-party transformations vary geographically within the post-conflict political landscape and how this geographical variation affects the electoral performance and mobilization strategies of former rebel groups. We argue that the electoral performance of rebels-turned-parties is a function of their ability to transform wartime military networks and organizational capabilities into political campaign machines. This ability varies with the geographic extent of wartime institutions: In areas where rebels institutionalized strategic control during war, they can activate former combatant networks by distributing economic benefits, appeal to political identities generated during the war, and credibly promise political and security returns on their implementation of the peace deal. We test these proposition using the case of the Indonesian province of Aceh. First, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between strategic wartime control on electoral performance in several post-conflict election rounds.

Meanwhile, cross-national studies on civil resistance have made important advances in understanding the varying outcomes of this type of uprising. However, no study has systematically studied women’s presence or absence in such campaigns. To advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the social composition of resistance campaigns, I provide the first cross-national study on female participation in resistance campaigns. I use a new dataset, The Anatomy of Resistance Campaigns, that maps the organizations that took part in episodes of maximalist resistance in Africa between 1990 and 2015. The data identifies female participation in organizations like political parties and trade unions, as well as the presence of women’s groups in the campaign. Comparing nonviolent and violent campaigns, the empirical analysis provides important answers to which factors on the macro- and meso level that matter for explaining variations in the participation of women in resistance campaigns.

We, therefore, examine how much the mass publics in the United States, Australia and Germany value reciprocity as a key cooperative principle in international trade. This analysis requires that we use a bilateral perspective that departs from the common approach to examine trade preferences unilaterally without consideration of the behaviour and characteristics of the trading partner. Our survey experiments show that reciprocity continues to play an important role, especially towards traditional allies. However, a significant share of unconditional, non-cooperative attitudes exists, especially towards potential political challengers like China. Variation in these responses are best explained by perceptions of the other country as political adversary as concerns for relative gains become eminent. Trade and foreign policy issues, thus, are particularly intertwined when facing a political adversary.

We, therefore, examine how much the mass publics in the United States, Australia and Germany value reciprocity as a key cooperative principle in international trade. This analysis requires that we use a bilateral perspective that departs from the common approach to examine trade preferences unilaterally without consideration of the behaviour and characteristics of the trading partner. Our survey experiments show that reciprocity continues to play an important role, especially towards traditional allies. However, a significant share of unconditional, non-cooperative attitudes exists, especially towards potential political challengers like China. Variation in these responses are best explained by perceptions of the other country as political adversary as concerns for relative gains become eminent. Trade and foreign policy issues, thus, are particularly intertwined when facing a political adversary. To the extent that the growing anti-globalization sentiment in many countries is rooted in these international political considerations, the threat to trade cooperation is more fundamental than often assumed.

In virtually all recent trade agreements, signatory countries refer to them to reduce regulatory heterogeneity and facilitate trade flows. But who actually develops these standards? In the area of food trade, standards are developed by Codex Alimentarius, a hybrid regulatory network of state and non-state actors founded in 1963. Until 1995, Codex standards were voluntary. In that year, the World Trade Organization endorsed Codex as the standard-setting organization in the area of food trade and requested its members to base their food-related measures on the standards developed by Codex. This form of legalization has hardened the previously soft-law nature of Codex standards and upgraded them to de facto binding rules for market access. The principal objective of this paper is to investigate whether and, if so, how this legalization has led to a politicization of standard-setting processes at Codex. Relying on network analysis, a newly created dataset on the participation of state and non-state actors in the over 800 standard-setting committee meetings of Codex Alimentarius is exploited.

In this paper, I argue that the current decline of the global free trade regime and the resurgence of protectionism cannot be explained by these domestic considerations alone. Therefore, I develop a theoretical model that reconsiders the role of trade policy as a foreign policy instrument. Criticizing and improving upon a recent paper on interstate bargaining (Fearon 2018), I show that trade wars are one important step in the escalation between foreign policy disagreement and violent conflict. In contrast to the aforementioned study, I conceptualize trade as an endogenous choice variable, along with arms level and conflict. States have to trade off using protectionist measures to hurt their opponent by giving up some of their own wealth, and risking escalation towards violent conflict by decreasing the economic interdependence between them. The theoretical argument is supported by an empirical investigation of protectionist and conflictual patterns in the 1870-2010 period, combining the CoW MID and CEPII TRADEHIST datasets.

The existing literature accounts for intelligence failure from various aspects: 1) bureaucratic/organizational pathology (Wohlstetter 1962), 2) intelligence network and information source (Jervis 2010), and 3) political psychology (Jervis 1976, 2010). US intelligence failure in the Iranian Revolution has been controversial both in academic and policy circles; yet, a truly systematic investigation of this failure has not been done. This paper conducts the first quantitative analysis of the Iranian revolution using newly declassified State Department cables from 1973-1979. A combination of methods including cable traffic analysis, discourse analysis, and network analysis is applied to the diplomatic documents to clarifying how insufficient intelligence networks and information sources undercut the US government’s ability to detect the political unrest in Iran. This study reveals that while empirical patterns of State Department cables are consistent with theoretical expectations and empirical findings by Jervis (1976, 2010), it highlights a necessity of further analysis of decision-makers’ perceptions and policy discussions, especially in the White House.

Critics often emphasize normative themes that highlight putative moral or organizational shortcomings in U.S. culture or institutions. We offer a compatible, simpler and less pejorative account that relies on physical geography and prior success. Precisely because the United States did so well in the past, remaining conflicts are bound to be less tractable. For example, previous victories in the Western hemisphere mean that the United States is increasingly fighting farther from home. Distance is tyrannical. It saps military strength and increases the cost of contests, even as it reduces U.S. expertise and motivations to prevail.

The success of this strategy depends on the size of economic costs that sanctioners can impose on their opponents by distorting trade and financial flows. Yet, existing studies indicate that governments and companies can adjust to such distortions, thereby reducing effectiveness of economic coercion. Specifically, research on sanctions’ effect on foreign direct investment indicates that sanctioning countries’ companies reduce their investments in targeted countries only temporarily, whereas companies from third-party countries take advantage of this temporary reduction by increasing their investment levels in targeted countries. The key limitation of this research, however, is its country-level focus, which fails to capture company-level decision-making processes and factors shaping them. In this paper, we consider how sanctions affect companies’ decisions to invest in a targeted country and how companies respond to the risk of investment substitution from third-party countries. We investigate effects of sanctions announced by companies’ home governments, as well as other governments, and consider varying responses of companies in different economic sectors.	Elena McLean

China has become a significant creditor to developing countries. Western companies complain that these loans are `door-openers’ for Chinese firms by increasing the likelihood of being awarded the necessary concessions by the recipient government. The argument suggests that Chinese loans increase Chinese FDI at the expense of investment by western firms. This paper analyzes if this claim is accurate. In addition, I check if this argument applies to other creditors as well. I find that loans from China do indeed increase subsequent FDI from China, but so do bilateral loans from France, Japan, and the United States. In contrast, bilateral lending by Brazil, India, Germany, and the United Kingdom do not increase FDI from these countries. I subsequently analyze why some counties exhibit the door-opener effect while others do not. In addition, I show that the door-opener effect operates through separate mechanisms for traditional lenders versus emerging creditors.	Jonas Bunte

Yet, with the responsiveness and responsibility of national decision-making institutions varying according to the type of political system and mode of interest intermediation, it is surprising that cross system studies remain the exception.

The results show that the quality of a firms’ relationship with policymakers is a key factor shaping corporate political strategy.

Fully aware of the political need for their own electorates' support to sustain global economic integration in trade and capital, Western policymakers have decided to discard international migration as an element of the post-WWII global economic order. Our analysis of the IMF and the World Bank programs demonstrates that these institutions use their financial resources to reduce migration inflows--caused by financial crises and poverty, respectively--into wealthy developed democracies.

Sectoral fragmentation of bilateral development aid and the role of the World Bank	Large donors of bilateral foreign aid are also the main funders for multilateral International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Bilateral and multilateral aid often go towards similar projects in the same sector, raising questions about the interactions between bilateral donors and IFIs and the possibility to reduce donor proliferation and increase coordination of aid delivery. Theoretically, IFIs should be well positioned to help overcome collective action problems associated with donor coordination. However, in this paper I argue that multilateral giving is flawed instrument for donor coordination. Donors fail to substitute multilateral for bilateral aid because of essential private benefits they derive from controlling bilateral aid flows. I investigate empirically whether the World Bank helps to fill gaps in sectors that receive insufficient bilateral aid and helps to increase coordination of bilateral giving across sectors. I find little evidence of this positive effect. Instead, World Bank engagement appears to free up bilateral donors to compete more intensely in a small number of sectors.	Martin Steinwand

We contribute to this literature by developing and testing a theory which describes how the catalytic effect also varies by economic sector. Our findings corroborate previous research, which find that in general IMF lending has a substantial and negative effect on foreign direct investment. However, we find that the negative effect is concentrated in sectors that are highly dependent on external capital and have high sunk costs in the host country. Our findings are robust to several alternative explanations common in IMF literature, namely the importance of IMF program design and the ability of governments to make credible commitments to reform. Substantively, our findings suggest that investors are more likely to use IMF lending as an escape hatch in countries where FDI is dependent on external capital and has low sunk costs.	Michael Breen

Nevertheless, the identification and prevention of illicit activity (e.g., insider trading and market manipulation) is still left to national regulators. But because these regulators are unable to observe trading activity that occurs in other jurisdictions, they are severely hamstrung in their ability to combat transnational financial crime. This paper seeks to understand why there is so little international cooperation on the surveillance of global capital markets. Drawing on the insights of two-level game theory and historical institutionalism, I posit that power dynamics between regulators, exchanges and large market participants at the domestic level is the primary determinant of whether we should expect to observe international cooperation on market surveillance. The arguments' expectations are tested against five qualitative case studies, utilising novel empirical evidence collected from archival material; newly disclosed documents obtained from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through a Freedom of Information Act request; and over 60 interviews conducted in London, Toronto, New York and Washington, D.C.

Although many developing countries regulate these tax planning practices– transfer pricing by MNCs-, the degree of transfer pricing regulations varies across countries. In this article, I explain for such a pattern by arguing that countries with strong rule of law are less likely to tighten transfer-pricing regulations. The reason is that MNCs are more likely to enter into countries with the strong rule of law and thereby give more voices over the policymaking process in their favorable direction. Using a dataset on transfer pricing regulations in 21 developing countries between 2001 and 2011, my findings conform to the theoretical expectation.	Mi Jeong Shin

Targeted financial sanctions, imposed as asset freezes and cessation of business relations with targeted firms, can prompt a retaliatory response from the target government, with implications for the relationship between sender and target countries. Under what conditions do governments retaliate in response to targeted financial sanctions imposed on their domestic firms? Retaliation is likely when the government is the intended target of the coercion and when the sanctions are imposed against politically relevant firms. I investigate this relationship using newly collected data on U.S. and Canadian targeted financial sanctions imposed on firms since 2001. First, I argue that the differentiation of sanctions policies based on the intended target of the coercion is necessary. Targeted financial sanctions are used against firms as a conduit to their government and against firms for their own behaviour, a distinction often missing from analyses of targeted sanctions. Second, I propose a conceptualization of government vulnerability to financial sanction costs as an explanation for retaliatory responses.	Caileigh Glenn

In this paper, I analyze drug-related sanctions by the United States since the institutional framework of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act offers three important advantages for research on the strategic imposition of sanctions. First, the annual report of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement offers a well-defined universe of potential sanction cases by listing all major drug transit and producing countries. Second, considering national interest waivers for decertified drug transit or producing countries as a sanction threat makes the coding of threats consistent. And third, the sender cannot vary the sanctions’ intensity since the measures always consist of withdrawing foreign assistance. This combination of a complete universe of cases as well as both consistent sanction threats and measures solves common methodological problems in the previous research on economic sanctions. Based on a unique dataset on drug-related US sanctions, I empirically test competing hypotheses on the strategic imposition of sanctions. I find that sanctions are biased towards countries which are both economically and geopolitically less relevant for the sender.	Patrick Weber

Recent studies of liberal intervention and state-building tend to focus on the extreme cases of outright military intervention. David Lake’s (2016) The Statebuilder’s Dilemma is but one recent example. While these costly liberal military interventions to build democratic institutions can be traced back to Thomas Paine’s(1792) promise to join Lafayette in a ‘campaign’ to abolish ‘German despotism,’ liberal state-building has manifested itself in a wide range of foreign policies. This paper explores a range of policies based on American foreign policy over the past century and propose a typology that will provide a more complete survey of liberal state building. Among these policies are encouraging free trade, constructive engagement, membership in international organizations, public diplomacy, social and educational exchanges, encouraging aspirational treaties like the Helsinki Accords, election monitoring, foreign aid to the state and to democratic forces within the state, sanctioning states and individuals for non-democratic practices, limited strategic military actions, and finally military intervention and occupation. With this exhaustive typology, we can begin to evaluate the effectiveness of liberal state-building efforts in a more thorough manner.	Thomas Walker

Specialists from either field, demoralized by the engagement between the two disciplines, have returned to the fold of their respective fields, strengthening their theoretical boundaries. But is countering interdisciplinary moves with progressive positivism and formalism from the legal perspective and politization of law from the other, really the right response? The interdisciplinary methods of the past have mainly consisted of a realist perspective on law, limiting the understanding of the entire body of international law to legal positivism. But also liberal perspectives have not succeeded in building a view of international law that could stand up to its critics. The by now known lacunae that even constructivist IR theory has not found a profound way of engaging with law, needs to be addressed. This paper attempts to do so, by engaging with the normative approaches in IR and the more recent interpretivist and practice approaches in IL.	Anna Knaps

An illocutionary speech act model posits an inductive poststructuralist framework for securitization theory. Successful securitization, I argue, hinges on a reflective, reflexive, cognitive process – the semiosis of security. In this paper, an analysis of Swedish asylum policy from 2010 to 2018 (since the entry of the Sweden Democrats into the Riksdag) is used to demonstrate the weak explanatory power of the pragmatic approach in the theoretical conceptualization of securitization. In recent years, the Swedish government’s resistance of the securitization of asylum advanced by the Sweden Democrats demonstrates the strength of shared hegemonic norms on human rights and the dominance of intrinsic, normative qualities of a constructed threat over extrinsic facts that arise from an ‘objective’ assessment of the actuality of the threat.

On the empirical side, our paper presents the first large-scale analysis of co-authorship in the UNGA. We find that the co-authorship of resolutions reflects slow-changing, structural variables such as social, political, and economic differences. Specifically, we show how the open and flexible cooperation patterns during the 1990s slowly moved towards a new bipolarity structured by regime type.	Daniel Finke

Why is this the case? While unexpected voting behavior is usually ascribed to vote-buying, it has not yet been directly tested to what extent money induces a country to vote against its own preferences. Focusing on vote-buying as an explanation for the differences in votes and speeches can help to overcome this problem. Accordingly, rich countries buy votes to legitimize their actions in international organizations vis-à-vis their domestic audience and reveal their preferences as focal points to potential supports in the international arena via speeches. Poor countries, by contrast, advocate for national interests in their speeches but deviate from them to comply with the preferences of the donor in order to extract aid. Hence, poor countries’ votes and speeches differ systematically as a result of vote-buying. I test this argument by predicting UN General Assembly votes from UN General Debate speeches and expect to find lower prediction accuracy for aid-recipients than for donors. If my theory holds, this systematic difference is the result of donor aid.	Dennis Hammerschmidt

In international development, market principles pervade donor decision-making about foreign aid allocation and delivery. An important aspect of this trend is that like-minded (as in pro-market) donor governments cooperate to promote market-driven development policies, while the ones who do not share this view are less likely to engage in this mode of cooperation. In this article, we use multi-linear regression and network analysis to explore patterns of collaboration between donors through trust funds.

They allow like-minded donors to support joint priority areas, while also acting as conduits for developing and disseminating best policy practices. We find support for our explanation for donor collaboration using Exponential Random Graph Models.

Institute for social research, Norway	p	77594	63	Organization Works: Hours of Work and the International Labor Organization	What is the impact of international organizations on social policy? Existing studies have examined the role of the International Labor Organization (ILO) by exploring the relationship between ratification of labor conventions and social expenditure. In contrast, we argue that the central mechanisms provided in favor of ratifications shaping policy, instead apply to becoming an ILO member and formulating conventions, not ratifying conventions. We test this using a new dataset on working time regulations between 1848 and 1990. First, we show that states that ratified the 48-hour week convention (C001) reduced their hours beforehand, with the long-term effect of C001 on hours being insignificant. Second, dealing with reverse causality by only analyzing ILO membership of Versailles treaty signatories, we find that membership is associated with a reduction in working time in the long-term. Third, following the adoption of a working time convention at General Conference of the ILO, hours tend to decrease, independent of whether a member ratifies said convention. Our findings indicate that ratification of conventions are not necessary for a convention to exert effect on policy.	Magnus Bergli Rasmussen

How are these features put into practice and what explains variation in the pattern of diplomatic deliberative practices between IOs? Drawing on unique and novel survey data, the paper explores the actual usage of institutional rules by the diplomats operating in IOs. On this basis, the paper uses functionalist and new institutionalism theories in order to develop hypotheses on variation, fit, and mismatch in institutional design and diplomatic deliberative practices within and across 45 different IOs. The hypotheses are comprehensively analyzed with quantitative methods. This provides novel insights into the inner working of institutions as well as into practices which limit the effect of deliberative design features or which operate as functional equivalents for formal institutional rules.

The paper draws on a unique and novel dataset to assess how institutional design fosters or inhibits diplomatic deliberation in more than 120 IOs. On this basis, the paper uses theories of neo-functionalism, rational choice institutionalism and liberal approaches to develop hypotheses on variation across IOs. The hypotheses are analyzed with quantitative methods, revealing several interesting insights: First, the institutional designs of IOs differ considerably with regard to diplomatic deliberation. Second, small size of IOs, delegates who can flexibly adjust their positions during negotiations, and regional membership criteria foster highly deliberative institutional designs. Third, the combination of three theoretical approaches is well-suited to account for variation in the diplomatic deliberative design of IOs.	Franziska Hohlstein

But this paper shows that international organizations (IOs) have always faced crises, some of which proved fatal to the IO. Furthermore, sentiment about international cooperations among scholars across disciplines -- economics, law, political science, and area studies -- has fluctuated in accordance with the fates of those IOs. This paper uses text analysis and topic modeling to track scholarly sentiment about IOs across disciplines, as a function of the vitality of IOs over time. I show that the current hand-wringing about international cooperation has historical precedent: scholarly enthusiasm for IOs has moved in lockstep with the rise and fall of various IOs themselves. I show the emergence of a particular paradigm after the fall of the Berlin Wall: the normative victory of global cooperation, as well as the empirical pattern of countries forming and joining IOs (and the emergence of quantitative methods that overly weighted those new IOs), led to overly bullish sentiment among IO scholars, despite pessism in the previous decades.

What are the effects of IGO withdrawals? By focusing on withdrawals from regional economic organizations, this paper provides the first systematic examination of the economic consequences of withdrawal. We argue that just as states join international economic organizations as part of an embedded liberal bargain, states anticipate that retreating from an IGO could lead to costs which they try to forestall through domestic stability policies. To estimate the causal effect of withdrawal from observational data, we leverage the synthetic control method and an original dataset of IGO withdrawals. We find strong support for our argument. First, states are unlikely to witness large economic costs because they anticipate potential costs and establish work-around strategies including using expansionary monetary policies or forum-shopping to an alternative overlapping organization. However, withdrawing states are likely to witness political costs because international investors and analysts may adjudicate the state’s retreat negatively because they have reneged on an international commitment, resulting in a lower assessment of the state’s political risk.

In the current discourse, this phenomenon is discussed as being exceptional in its extent and degree. However, the struggle between the delegation and the preservation of national sovereignty has characterized the relationship between IOs and their member states for decades. In this paper, I develop a conceptual framework to analyze the patterns of the reassertion of national sovereignty. I propose four different types of how states reassert their sovereignty, namely budget cuts, staff obstruction, non-compliance with core norms and membership withdrawal. By taking into consideration the justifications of member states for reasserting their sovereignty, I distinguish these acts from the instrumentalization or the politicization of an IO. I illustrate this with first empirical insights into the patterns of sovereignty challenges against IOs between 1920 and 2018.	Gisela Hirschmann

University of Bremen, Germany	p	82531	169	Complexity and Compliance in the Inter-American Human Rights System	Research on international regimes has increasingly focused on the role of institutional complexity. Also, research has shown the growing level of complexity of human rights regimes. Even though the human rights literature has largely focused on explanations of the conditions under which countries comply with their obligations, whether and how institutional complexity affects the compliance record of countries remains largely unknown. This paper aims to fill this gap and looks at the influence of treaty ratification on compliance through the angle of regime complexity. We investigate the link between institutional complexity and compliance with respect to the Inter-American Human Rights System. In a first part, the paper presents a theoretical argument why and how institutional complexity influences compliance with human rights.

Also, research has shown the growing level of complexity of human rights regimes. Even though the human rights literature has largely focused on explanations of the conditions under which countries comply with their obligations, whether and how institutional complexity affects the compliance record of countries remains largely unknown. This paper aims to fill this gap and looks at the influence of treaty ratification on compliance through the angle of regime complexity. We investigate the link between institutional complexity and compliance with respect to the Inter-American Human Rights System. In a first part, the paper presents a theoretical argument why and how institutional complexity influences compliance with human rights. In the second part, we rely on a measure of institutional complexity based on states’ subscription to human rights treaties and their decision density on human rights to analyze the effect of complexity on compliance. Results based on the prohibition of torture show that complexity influences the level of compliance, however, not necessarily in the expected direction.	Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, Simone Wegmann

Extant scholarship focused on the rhetorical strategies majority opinions employ to persuade external audiences. Less is known about how judges craft their individual opinions and what functions such opinions might serve. We argue that judges use individual opinions strategically to influence the future direction of case law and they do this by invoking considerations of fairness and harm rather than pure legal language. Accordingly, we expect dissenting opinions to contain more of the aforementioned rhetorical strategy than other types of individual opinions and that the reliance on such language will increase as the ideological distance between the dissenting judge and the majority judges increases. We evaluate our argument using quantitative text analysis on more than 3,000 individual opinions authored by judges from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Appointed from 47 different states, ECtHR judges often disagree concerning the application of human rights law. In this context, we show that rhetorical strategies employed in individual opinions offer unique insights into how judges respond to disagreements and view the future role of the Court.

The focus of existing research is primarily on development programs, which represent one sector of multilateral assistance. This paper explores the interaction of formal rules and informal influence in an environmental organization – the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Implementation of environmental projects requires purchases of goods and services; hence, the GEF’s funding flows to suppliers in all eligible countries. On the one hand, such purchases follow procurement procedures that rely on competitive bidding, which maximize efficient use of scarce financial resources. On the other hand, donor and recipient countries seek to extract private benefits from the GEF’s funding by allocating more contracts to their preferred suppliers. I use data on contract awards for GEF-funded projects from 1995 through 2015 to evaluate patterns of contract allocation and identify beneficiaries of GEF-funded project procurement.	Elena McLean

Support for Climate Action under Weak International Institutions	The Paris Climate Agreement emphasizes strong domestic policy for future climate action. However, we know little about whether and how voters support domestic climate action when international climate agreements are weak. The climate politics literature is largely divided into those who argue that individuals take foreign action into account when formulating their own preferences for domestic policy, while others contend that the foreign climate does not shape support for domestic action. Responding to this debate, we study how voters in representative democracies position themselves towards domestic climate policy that is only loosely linked to international governance. We investigate voter-level support for different attributes of national climate action with a survey experiment in the United Kingdom to see whether and how informational treatments about the costs and benefits of strong domestic climate action generate “losers versus winners” sentiments among the public. Critically, we also investigate how domestic voter preferences vary as voters learn about the implications from climate policy abroad. This research will help us adjudicate between theoretical explanations for national climate action in a weakly institutionalized global climate order.	Patrick Bayer, Federica Genovese

We find that the effect of climate change on migration is conditional upon initial levels of economic development in sending countries as well as the type of migration. Climate change (especially in the form of increasing temperatures) leads to more out-migration by the low-skilled in relatively poor and to less medium-skilled migration in relatively rich countries; there is no effect of climate change on high-skilled migration. Analyzing potential transmission channels, we find that in the relatively poor countries of our sample climate change reduces agricultural production, economic growth and fertility but promotes urbanization and political instability, while promoting industrialization in the relatively rich countries. Finally, we also provide long-run estimates of the effect of climate change on migration, which yield findings similar to our panel estimates.	Marc Helbling

Existing work focuses on the informational value of arms transfers, viewing them as costly signals of an ally's commitment to the protege. In this paper, I provide a distinct, complete-information explanation: arms transfers alter the balance of power and can mitigate power shifts, eliminating commitment problems. To do this, I develop a formal model in which a defender, protege, and challenger interact repeatedly over an infinite horizon. When the future balance of power is certain, the ally never transfers arms. However, when a power shift is expected, arms transfers may occur in equilibrium as they prevent the protege from initiating a preventive war. I then use the theoretical results to shed light on historical patterns of arms transfers between major powers and their proteges.	Bradley Smith

The United States’ has long opposed nuclear proliferation. However, empirically, many U.S. allies have chosen to research and develop nuclear capabilities. Existing theories do not account for the interrelated strategic choices to enter alliances and to pursue nuclear weapons, nor do empirical estimates incorporate this strategic behavior. This paper constructs a strategic probit model based on a new theory in which weaker states strategically manipulate nuclear latency to influence strong states' alliance offers. Strong states select weak states into alliances based on latency to change their nuclear development calculus. The estimates overturn two pieces of conventional wisdom. First, nuclear latency can reverse the traditional fears of abandonment and push past entrapment concerns in uncertain security environments to drive alliance formation. Second, I show that high latency states that are militarily strong can use latency to secure alliance guarantees.	Justin Nicholson

International Relations scholarship has almost exclusively focussed on European alliances prior to 1945 and Washington’s alliances with its NATO allies, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan since then. Literature that puzzles at multilateralism in Europe and bilateralism in Asia is either inconclusive or cannot explain why by 1951 Truman ultimately wanted Japan and many of its wartime adversaries in a multilateral alliance. This paper makes two contributions. First, it contributes to debates about threat perception by showing that Australian insecurities in the early Cold War were mostly directed not at Moscow or Beijing but Australia’s then vanquished wartime adversary Japan. Second, it argues that bilateralism may offer greater insurance against entrapment but carries additional assurance costs. Truman could not achieve a multilateral alliance in Asia because Australia and others would not join an alliance with Japan. Their consent to the Japan settlement required additional alliances that raised assurance problems.	Michael Cohen

What strategies and challenges exist for communities to mold the social contract? We propose to explore these questions through a methodologically innovative approach: the first “Metaketa” initiative to focus on qualitative data and research. The project expands the model of the Metaketa initiative initiated by the Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) network to focus on external validity, causal inference and hypothesis testing using qualitative data. In applying the Metaketa model, the project will coordinate six research teams to use overlapping measurements, pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, joint tools of analysis, and secondary analysis of qualitative data to address our joint research question (as well as a variety of sub-questions) across different cases. Teams will study the actions of the various actors involved in forging the social contract – ranging from governments, local non-governmental organizations and activists, development agencies, international organizations, and of course local constituents themselves. This paper sets out the design parameters of the proposed approach, and describes possible opportunities and potential pitfalls.	Florian Kern, Alexandra Hartman

In applying the Metaketa model, the project will coordinate six research teams to use overlapping measurements, pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, joint tools of analysis, and secondary analysis of qualitative data to address our joint research question (as well as a variety of sub-questions) across different cases. Teams will study the actions of the various actors involved in forging the social contract – ranging from governments, local non-governmental organizations and activists, development agencies, international organizations, and of course local constituents themselves. This paper sets out the design parameters of the proposed approach, and describes possible opportunities and potential pitfalls.	Florian Kern, Alexandra Hartman

In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders is not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study its benefits using the example of text data. We perform a series of experiments to identify the conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these experiments on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in all cases where the document class of interest is not perfectly balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the labeled documents one would need using random sampling (or passive' learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of inter-coder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that with low-reliability, active learning can lead to decreased performance.

Yet, we also typically have reasons for expecting certain types of heterogeneity in our analysis (e.g. temporally or spatially varying effects). This paper provides a unified framework for modelling the most common sorts of heterogeneity by leveraging the concept of 'complex sparsity' from machine learning. To implement this idea for social scientific questions, however, it is necessary to develop a new inferential procedure as existing methods cannot quantify uncertainty nor estimate non-linear models without approximations. This paper addresses this by deriving a new Bayesian representation of complex sparsity by combining the generalized and group LASSOs. For fast inference, I derive a novel EM estimation procedure that is guaranteed to converge to a posterior mode. The paper re-analyses two existing papers. One focuses on youth turnout and shows how leveraging geographic heterogeneity allows for more robust fixed effects to be included; the other shows that including varying coefficients across time and space moderates the relationship between segregation and public goods.

The advantages of multiple imputation over listwise deletion are clear and widely acknowledged. Furthermore, the introduction of special purpose software for Multiple Imputation like Amelia II or mi has made it easier as ever before to create multiply imputed data sets. However, the assumptions behind these approaches are sometimes forgotten. This is unfortunate since both approaches only provide valid imputations if the assumptions hold. This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets to political science as a more flexible alternative to the state-of-the-art. The new algorithm draws imputed values from arbitrary complex joint distributions of the observed data. With the main advantage over existing approaches that a researcher needs no prior knowledge about the functional forms or structural relationships in the data. I show that it can efficiently impute values in cross-sectional data as well as time-series cross-sectional data and provides significantly better imputations than current approaches.

The most prominent attempt in the literature is the synthetic control method, but this has important drawbacks. First, by not controlling for post-treatment variables, a degree of precision is lost in the estimator. By estimating what the post-treatment variables would be absent treatment we can regain some of the efficiency of the estimator. Second, by only including as donor units those that have similar trends, we are losing valuable information. Finally, the synthetic control method does not lend well to estimates of uncertainty, making traditional hypothesis testing ad hoc. I develop a new method, Gaussian process projection, that circumvents these issues, and as such performs better than other methods in terms of bias and efficiency, and produces an estimate of uncertainty of the projected unit absent the treatment. We can estimate the causal effect of an intervention, and by using the measure of uncertainty, we can determine how unlikely the difference would be due to chance.	David Carlson

Empirically, a prominent strategy is to estimate a spatial Durbin model and use either of the asymptotically equivalent likelihood ratio, Lagrange multiplier, or Wald test to scrutinize the non-linear common factor restrictions implied by pure error dependence. While previous research reveals important disparities in the test statistics' finite sample behaviors, the Wald test's sensitivity to algebraically equivalent alternative formulations of the null hypothesis receives scant attention in the context of cross-sectional analyses. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations, I investigate the performance of the Wald test under different expressions of the null hypothesis. As the results illustrate, the alternative formulations produce different test statistics and, at times, conflicting conclusions in small to medium sized samples. By implication, researchers need to exercise caution when using the Wald test to discriminate between substantive and residual dependence and should habitually perform robustness tests.

We adopt a data-driven approach which integrates exploration, prediction and explanation into a single research design. Our cartography reveals that involvement in the preliminary ruling procedure tends to be concentrated in a relatively small subset of regions within member states. Next, applying machine learning methods, we find that the presence of organizations like peak courts and infrastructures like large cargo ports constitute strong predictors of EU law use. So too are capital cities and indicators of economic prosperity. Finally, we rationalize these findings using text mining and additional empirical tests. We argue that spatial variations are induced by the team structure of the EU court system and the division of labour within national judiciaries as well as by the resources and geographic location of litigants.

Yet does this reasoning hold in spatial contexts? In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine how different forms of missingness in the dependent variable affect models that include a spatial lag of the dependent variable.

Proximity and directional theories of issue voting offer different answers to this question that have strong implications for parties' strategies. Controlled scenarios in imaginary two-candidate contests recently gained popularity as a method to identify proximity and directional voters. However, they are not always applicable in comparative research on electoral behavior where scholars often have to study multiparty elections with observational data. In the present paper, I propose a method of probabilistically discriminating between issue voting rules based on finite mixture modeling. Using a paradigmatic case in the proximity--directional debate, I demonstrate that the mixture model describes observed voting choices better than the alternatives. I also show how mixture modeling can be used to study individual-level characteristics of proximity and directional voters. The proposed method can be applied to study issue voting rules from the comparative perspective.	Kirill Zhirkov

However, they also pose challenges, as the data are typically unbalanced in terms of which indicators are available, for which geographical units, at a given time point. The Eurobarometer is a case in point: This survey has covered up to 38 different countries or territories, roughly twice per year for nearly 50 years, with a large number of indicators related to citizens' views of the European Union (EU). The availability of the indicators varies widely: There is no time point at which all indicators are available for all countries, and there is no indicator available for all time points. This paper presents a new database collecting nearly all publicly available Eurobarometer data related to the EU. It overcomes the indicator availability issue by developing two Bayesian state space models to estimate latent trends of support. The most advanced version entails an ordered-probit Dirichlet-multinomial IRT model that accounts for heteroskedastic overdispersion.	Jørgen Bølstad

Measurement of 'soft systems' (Finkelstein 2005) requires an account that goes beyond the establishment of a homomorphism between the real line and a fully observable world. A 'soft systems' account of measurement changes the nature and management of measurement error, and this change is particularly evident when it comes to systematic, as opposed to random, measurement error. This paper introduces (to political science) the concept of 'soft systems' measurement, derives the implications for the analysis of systematic measurement error and statistical analysis, and finally discusses measurement error as equivalent to a chronic disease that must be managed.

To increase comparability, responses are sometimes scaled using anchoring items. Such scaling assumes that the responses to the anchoring items are informative on the heterogeneity in scale use. This assumption is not always met in practice. This paper presents a flexible framework that abandons this assumption, in order to diagnose issues with anchoring items and produce better re-scaling by identifying and weighting down non-informative responses. The framework is based on finite mixtures, and rests on sorting the responses into informative and non-informative ones. The informative responses belong to the measurement model of interest and the non-informative ones to a contamination model. The paper presents four contamination models: (1) mid-point inflation, (2) inflation at unknown points, (3) respondent-specific inflation point, and (4) answers driven by a concept other than the one of interest.

The positions are dynamically estimated and, therefore, comparable over time. I generate left-right preference data for all individual MEPs as well as all member state governments in the Council for the period from 1994 to 2014. The data is well suited for testing theories of bicameral decision-making in the European Union. I scale roll-calls in the European Parliament using a Bayesian IRT model. The scale is anchored by exploiting national party positions from the expert surveys as bridge observations. Re-elected legislators are used as bridge observations across legislative terms. In addition, I include contextual information and estimates form a commonly used scaling model – NOMINATE – as covariates. The estimates have high face validity and the model generates sensible estimates even when the quality of the underlying roll-call data is low.	Philipp Broniecki

Kuiper	University of Utrecht, Netherlands	p	84472	320	A Bayesian method for aggregating evidence from diverse statistical models	The gold standard for evidence is an empirical result which is consistent across multiple studies, may these be independently conducted or replications of original findings. Current aggregation approaches in the social scientist’s toolbox, most prominently meta-analysis and Bayesian updating, combine individual effect estimates and come with the drastic shortcoming that they can only be applied if homogeneous statistical models sharing a common functional form are underlying all studies of interest. This limits their applicability since social and political researchers typically tackle research problems using diverse statistical models. We suggest a Bayesian method that allows to aggregate independent and replication findings even if stemming from different design choices, statistical models, and types of estimates. We achieve this by combining evidence for hypotheses rather than effect sizes. Substantive expectations are first translated into informative hypotheses that go far beyond the NHST framework and evidence for these is aggregated over studies by updating their prior and posterior model probabilities. Next to introducing our method, we evaluate its performance using statistical simulation, and demonstrate its application on an empirical example using original software.	Lion Behrens

Neither p-value nor confidence interval allows us to make an intuitive interpretation; they have also led us to choose a specific threshold to make a binary choice, determining the presence of evidence for an estimated effect or the lack thereof. The posterior probability distribution overcomes these problems. It allows us to calculate the probability of an estimated effect exceeding a certain effect size – not necessarily the null value – given our prior belief; the probability as a continuous measure of uncertainty does not compel us to make a binary choice. The first property equips political scientists with a way to communicate their findings with non-specialists such as policymakers more intuitively and informatively; the second property helps the discipline to overcome the publication bias of p<5% and promote a more nuanced debate. I illustrate the utility of the posterior probability distribution using Monte Carlo simulations and one replication study.	Akisato Suzuki

To address these concerns, the most common approaches to test hypotheses rely on seeming unrelated regressions using log-ratio transformations of compositional dependent variables. However, empirical practice has devoted limited attention to the challenges we face in interpreting hypothesis results in these models. In this paper, I first review how these specifications address bias and efficiency concerns in both cross-section and dynamic settings. I then focus on replicating recent studies that have employed these modeling specifications to illustrate some of the potential pitfalls that can be encountered in hypothesis testing and interpretation.

The standard response to this problem is a conditional ML that removes group-specific effects. While conditional ML consistently estimates the coefficients on time-varying covariates, it makes predicted probabilities impossible to compute. In response to this problem multiple approaches for computing these effects have emerged. However, there is little guidance as to when one solution may be preferred to another. In this paper, I address this question by considering two approaches: Penalized-ML (PML) and Correlated Random Effects. With few within-group observations the CRE is overwhelmingly preferred, but as the number of within-group observations increases, so does the PML's performance. In larger datasets, the differences between these approaches is negligible, but computation time increases. I solve this problem by providing R code for a sparse PML.	Casey Crisman-Cox

Yet, the debate over hate speech rests on untested claims about the effectiveness and consequences of regulatory intervention. We present a pre-registered study to test two hypotheses on preference falsification as unintended consequence of hate speech regulation. Using two double list experiments embedded in nationally representative online panels in the US and Germany, we identify true preferences on a controversial topic and on freedom of expression. We contrast these to directly reported preferences, where half of the respondents are randomly treated with a fictitious hate speech law. This allows us to see, if respondents show a greater difference between what they truly believe and what they say they believe about a protected social group, when faced with sanction for hate speech. In addition, we are able to test whether hate speech regulation results in a chilling effect on public discourse. This effect would be particularly harmful for democracy, which rests on the free debate of policy options.	Richard Traunmueller

A Lexical Assessment of News in France, Spain, and the UK (2008-2014)”	This paper analyses how the mainstream newspapers of France, Spain, and the UK presented the European Union and European member states to their national publics during the last economic crisis. It also inquires how they presented austerity policies, and whether these policies were debated. Using an original dataset, I apply a quantitative lexical analysis to a random sample of 800 articles published by 15 newspapers between 2008 and 2014. The dataset presents a strong lexical convergence among the three countries. There is an overwhelming amount of economic and financial terms, and no significant mentions to any other social or political subject. They hardly ever identify a specific person or institution. They use extremely vague words to refer to the EU, but are not particularly negative. These findings contradict the expectation of divergent media discourses related to different national contexts. The hegemonic discourse presents no options to austerity policy-making and no debates on its social consequences. No information helps to trace political responsibilities. The excess of economic jargon does not facilitate the comprehension of technical issues for the general public.	Sabina Monza

Terrorism has drastically changed in recent years, with the rise of what has been termed “lone-wolf terrorism” in Western countries reflecting a search for a new vocabulary. This paper applies framing theory and combines computerised-content analysis with discourse analysis to explore how the BBC News frames terrorism through both its visual and textual channels. It analyses 750 articles reporting the 14 recent vehicle-ramming terrorist attacks that occurred in Europe and North America between July 2016 and April 2018. Indeed, news stories do not simply present a description of facts, but through a system of organised signifying elements, play a key role in (re)constructing reality. The way news media represents the reality of terrorism has direct consequences on the nature of counter-terrorist policies, shapes the way terrorism manifests in the future and is one of the current main causes of social discrimination against Muslims and Islamophobia. Overall, this study sheds light onto how both language and images subtly represent and construct terrorist acts in specific ways, highlighting a need to develop more rigorous and exhaustive guidelines to report such events.

One of the reasons is that frames are an abstract variable, notoriously hard to identify and code in manual content analysis, which makes automatic classification difficult as well. To overcome this issue, I propose a supervised learning approach to content analysis of media frames. The procedure first codes frame elements, based on Entman’s (1993) definition, in a training sample before using supervised machine learning algorithms to reproduce the classification on a larger data set. In contrast to other approaches, media frames are identified after the coding by clustering elements into groups. The approach improves reliability and validity of frame detection as well as text classification. In contrast to fully automated approaches, like for example topic models, this gives the researcher full control over what is important for category building. To test the approach, I analyse newspaper articles about protest and demonstrations, published in eight major UK national newspapers from 1992-2017.	Johannes Gruber

Yet given the abundance of low-quality information on the Internet, how do citizens judge the accuracy of news they read online? Previous scholarship suggests that people process new information in terms of congruence with their attitudes, and that they give credit to professional sources. To test how attitudinal congruence and source professionalism determine judgements of news on social media, and how new information affects attitudes, I ran an online survey experiment (N = 418) during the 2017 German election campaign. Subjects were randomly assigned to constructed news item and indicated whether they believed it, across several topics. The findings suggest a strong impact of attitudinal congruence, with no source effect for most topics; only for one topic, subjects gave credit to the professional source. This is bad news for media organisations active on social media. However, the experimental evidence for attitude shifts caused by new information was limited, which qualifies fears about the effects of disinformation.	Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg

Several fact checking mechanisms has been proposed by IT and media companies to tackle this problem, it appears that verification of pieces of information is very difficult as the “truth” is often uncertain. An alternative approach is identifying sources of false information, but no comprehensive list is available. This paper proposes an efficient “snowballing” method to identify such sources using a commercial search engine API and high-performance document similarity computation tools that the author has developed as open-source software. Using the novel method, the author identified satellite websites that spread information resembles to Russian’s state-run sources such as RT, TASS and Sputnik News, which are created or used primarily as “anchors” that facilitate spread of false information on the social media platforms. The author argues that identifying and monitoring those satellites websites is an effective way to tackle online propaganda not only by Russia but extremist groups.	Kohei Watanabe

This paper studies what kind of media messages are selected by the audience during European election campaigns. It puts forward several hypotheses that tap respondents’ characteristics (e.g., interest in EU politics, political attitudes, media trust) as well as message characteristics (e.g., personalization, negativity, type of news outlet). To test the hypotheses, a survey experiment will be conducted with 1,500 German respondents with Research Now/SSI in spring 2019. The survey will include moderating variables at the level of the respondents before they are being randomly exposed to various pairs of news headlines. The latter vary on several aspects which are randomized internally. Respondents will be asked to choose one news article out of two, six times in a row, which they would be able to read later (the debriefing will explain this deception). The results will be analysed by conjoint analysis and have important implications for scholars working on campaigning effects in Europe and beyond.	Katjana Gattermann

We aim to improve on the understanding of this phenomenon by focusing on the Swiss national elections 2015, relying on an almost comprehensive sample of news items covering most of the duration of the campaign, including about 275,000 documents from 91 sources, covering over 3,000 male and female candidates. First, we examine how much attention male and female candidates receive in the media. Second, we consider how the sentiment of coverage co-varies with mentions of male or female candidates. Third, we use topic models to identify how the themes of newspaper coverage and how the candidates' gender is linked to both the topics and the language used to discuss them. Results show how newspapers covered male and female candidates during an important national election campaign.	Fabrizio Gilardi

I investigate this question through a study of Taiwanese politics, which is notoriously divided into the Pan-blue and Pan-green coalitions, and which has also been marked by vigorous use of Facebook for online campaigning. I collected more than 6,000,000 comments on over 10,000 posts from the public Facebook pages of six presidential candidates and 289 legislative candidates in the 30 days leading up to the 2016 Taiwanese general election. I created bipartite networks for politician and normal users. Hypothesizing that the networks of comments are not limited by electoral districts and instead exhibit segregated partisan structures, I apply network clustering algorithms and community detection methods to reciprocal commenting. I also analyze the URLs on candidates’ pages to identify whether coalition affiliation affects the information sources shared by candidates.	Xiaodong Zhang

Less attention has been paid to the ways in which online communication on polarized issues crosses linguistic and cultural borders. Is such communication divided primarily by viewpoint or by language? How do information and arguments flow between the domestic and the international levels? And what are state and non-state actors’ communication strategies in linguistically divided policy debates? This study addresses these questions through a quantitative analysis of online debate over Japan’s whaling policy. I assemble a dataset of whaling-related tweets sent since September 2018 (and thus covering the IWC meeting where Japan’s proposal to resume commercial whaling was rejected, and the May 2019 CITES meeting where a backlash against Japan is expected). I use manual coding and supervised machine learning to classify tweets regarding their position on whaling.

Lee in Emancipation Park. Heralding it the Unite the Right Rally, protestors brandished firearms and torches as they walked through the streets shouting racist and homophobic chants over two days. A state of emergency ensued as violence spread, eventually turning deadly after James Fields Jr. drove into a crowd of counter-protestors, injuring scores and killing Heather Heyer, a 32 year-old Charlottesville resident. The proposed paper is a content analysis of the public response on Twitter to the Charlottesville riots. Analyzing responses to tweets made on August 11 and 12 by activists on the ground – namely Richard Spencer, one of the rally’s organizers, and Charlottesville resident Emily Gorcenski – this paper seeks to illustrate the important civil society dialogue occurring on Twitter, alongside the utility of social media content analysis as a valuable means of real-time public opinion measurement and the increasingly important role social media has in contemporary political events.

At the same time, research on the social identity theory and gender roles reveal that information about political candidates in both traditional and new media can provide gender stereotypical content. In turn, this can lead to the activation of gendered concepts that impacts the evaluation of candidates. However, only little is known about gender biased information about political candidates in search engines, which function as information gatekeeper in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques, this study examines whether search engines autocomplete suggestions for members of the German Bundestag differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender of the politician and explores if the search engine representation of politicians changes over time. The study further compares gender differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from the search engines.

The wide penetration of the internet among the population, prompts political representatives to use the internet for political purposes. The existing research, mainly studying the digital divide among the political candidates, demonstrates that there are significant inequalities among the candidates in using the internet for political campaigning. However, literature analyzing digital inequality among elected representatives is still lacking. This paper fills the literature gap and provides deeper understanding of the origins of digital inequalities among elected representatives. Based on original data collection through the Panel of Elected Representatives in Norway (PER), which includes representatives in Norway at all the levels of political representation and by means of a multilevel analysis, I am investigating the role of personal internet skills, socio-demographic and political variables, and constituency characteristics as factors that influence the digital inequality among elected representatives. Building on the literature on online campaigning and offline political representation, I argue that digital inequality appears more commonly among with female, older, more senior, less educated and minority representatives.

Exploring the Impact of #metoo in the News Media Discourse in Australia	Twitter gave momentum to #metoo, as it provided a direct channel for women’s voices to be heard. This was amplified by increased media attention, raising public awareness with detailed accounts of sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace. In Australia, the Human Rights Commission revised the legal framework of sexual harassment, but many still doubt the success of #metoo in the country (Cave 2018). Against this background, we take the concept of politicisation (de Wilde 2011) as a point of departure and investigate how the #metoo debate impacted public discourses on gender equality issues in Australia. We assess a total of two years of media coverage in the country’s largest newspapers, situating the beginning of #metoo in the middle of our period of analysis (November 2016-November 2018). Methodologically, we rely on (1) a small-scale manual claims analysis performed on a systematic random sample of articles, complemented by (2) an automated content analysis of all articles regarding salience, polarisation and expansion of actors. Results are discussed with reference to real-life changes that have occurred in the Australian political landscape.	Elena Escalante Block, Olga Eisele

We use an experimental framework to test for the effects of three emotions (anger, anxiety, and hope) on attitudes towards climate change policies and willingness to act for the environment in the context of Turkey. Turkey is an interesting case as despite a lack of political discourse on climate security, public opinion survey results show a relatively high level of perceived threat of climate change. This study reports the findings of the pilot survey conducted among a student sample in April and May 2018. While there is some support for the effects of anger and anxiety on support for government policies, we do not find messages carrying hope emotions to influence individual willingness to change behaviour or join collective acts to save the environment.

Recent work suggests that individual variation in negativity biases is correlated with political ideology (Oxley et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2011; Dodd et al. 2012; Renshon et al. 2015; Osmundsen et al. 2017; Arceneaux et al. 2018): persons who have stronger physiological reactions to threatening or disgusting stimuli are prone to hold more conservative attitudes. But such results have been encountered in the US. Does the link between negativity bias and political ideology apply elsewhere? We answer this question with the most extensive cross-national psychophysiological study to date. Respondents across 17 countries and all continents were exposed to positive/negative televised news reports, and disgusting /threatening /neutral / positive images. Sensors tracked heart rate and skin conductance. A survey captured ideology with a left-right scale, a Wilson-Patterson scale, and partisanship. Analyses performed at three levels of aggregation – respondent-as-a-case, stimuli-as-a-case, and second-by-second time series – suggest some complexity in the link between negativity biases and political ideology.

Twitter is undoubtedly the main channel of communication for US President Trump and an important source of news for journalists reporting on the Presidency. In a previous article (Ross & Dumitrescu 2018, forthcoming in New Media and Society) we showed that including tweets from ordinary people in in a public policy news article has a sizable effect on readers’ perceptions of the public opinion on the policy. In this paper we rely on two connected experiments to investigate the effects of the modality of reporting Trump’s opinions in journalist-produced news articles. Participants (strong and moderate Republicans and Democrats) read one of three versions of an article about Trump, including either: (1) Trump’s original tweets as embedded in the article, (2) the text of his tweets in quotation marks, or (3) a summary of his tweets by the journalist.

Despite the proliferation of “fake news” aimed at galvanizing public outrage against certain individuals and outgroups, there is little research on how content translates into individual support for violent and discriminatory behavior. This study explores the link between online content, moral outrage, and support for violence against individuals and outgroups. We hypothesize that moral-emotional frames that sensationalize transgressive behavior provoke outrage against targeted individuals and outgroups, in turn increasing individuals’ propensity to use or support violent and hateful expression against them. We approach this hypothesis using a survey experiment as well as a big data analysis of populations of articles and comments taken from a wide range of media sources. We find that outgroup cues, sensationalized framing of transgressions, and peer support for violence increases individuals' support for punitive violence against individuals and outgroups. Our findings contribute to our understanding of how political and social actors can use online content to mobilize support for violence and discriminatory policies; and has important policy implications for the debate on content moderation.

Affective intelligence theory is used to structure the research process and dictionary-based sentiment classification helps to operationalize variables – such as tonality and emotional content of tweets – that are not directly obtainable from Twitter or other sources. Initial findings indicate that tonality of messages, gender of the communicator, presence of a hashtag, reference to a political opponent as well as the size of the follower base are significant determinants of the user engagement for a given political message. Correlating the tonality of messages sent by political actors and respectively received by them, one also comes to additional findings. First of all, language which is emotionally positive is a better predictor of engagement for a given piece of political information. And secondly, more positive posts by political actors also tend to receive more positive replies, albeit with a significant gender bias.	Ayjeren Rozyjumayeva

Through the analysis of tweets during the election campaigns, previous research has found that in critical times in politics, politicians tend to avoid engaging in dialogue with other users and to prefer uni-directional communication, such as mobilization, because of the fear of facing uncivil responses. This may not be surprising as their political careers are at stake in elections. However, less is known about other politically intense periods. Using all tweets related to the Brexit Referendum during its campaign period, we analyze one of such occasions. In particular, we explore the motivations of using Twitter in the referendum campaign by Members of the UK Parliament and Members of the European Parliament. We conduct content analysis to categorize tweets by politicians from two schemes. The first is the aforementioned purposes of social media communication such as mobilization and discussion. The second is the frames in a tweet toward the subject of the tweets. Also, we analyze the patterns of citizens’ responses in tweets to the politicians.	Akitaka Matsuo

In this sense, beyond describing the proportion of OPM for all online advertisements, I shine some light on how do they use it in campaign. To that end, I create a typology of OPM from a party strategy point of view that drive the paper to hypothesize: (i) messages will be more precise at the micro-level than at the macro-level. (ii), stealth advertisers are more present in microtargeted communications than in macro-level style messages and, also, (iii) more used for positive campaigning than for negative campaigning. Thus, I exploit an unique database of political ads in first order campaigns in four European countries –German 2017 Federal Elections, Austrian 2017 Legislative Elections, Italian 2018 General Elections and Swedish 2018 General Elections–. Results not only suggest that European parties indeed use OPM in a strategic manner but also advance implications for research disciplines such political communication, party strategy or data protection.

The speed of interaction on social media provides parties with instantaneous feedback and thus allows them to adapt their campaign messages with hardly any delay. Even so, there is very little empirical work on whether and how parties make use of these new possibilities. To close this gap, we use a unique data set covering every Facebook post by parties and party leaders in the run-up to the Austrian parliamentary election in 2017, including user reactions. We test the hypothesis that parties are more likely to double down on issues that have previously generated higher levels of user engagement. We also differentiate between different types of reactions (positive vs. negative, clicking vs. commenting).

These gender differences in issue attention are often attributed to preferences or to specialization within parties. Using insights from cognitive psychology and economic sociology, we propose a new explanation focusing on the demand side: the expectations of voters. We argue that citizens approve more of political messages that are congruent with socially relevant characteristic of the politician such as their gender. This approval in turn can reinforce gender stereotypical topic choices as politicians adjust their policy platform to cater to voters. To investigate our claim, we collect data from the Twitter accounts of all Spanish regional and national parliamentarians for six months. We first construct, for each tweet, a measure of gender congruence using machine learning methods. We then show that gender congruent tweets receive more feedback using a model with politician and day fixed effects. Furthermore, politicians react to this by sending more gender congruent tweets. Feeding this into a simulation, we demonstrate that the feedback can lead to a widening gap between the messages of male and female politicians.	Aina Gallego

These gender differences in issue attention are often attributed to preferences or to specialization within parties. Using insights from cognitive psychology and economic sociology, we propose a new explanation focusing on the demand side: the expectations of voters. We argue that citizens approve more of political messages that are congruent with socially relevant characteristic of the politician such as their gender. This approval in turn can reinforce gender stereotypical topic choices as politicians adjust their policy platform to cater to voters. To investigate our claim, we collect data from the Twitter accounts of all Spanish regional and national parliamentarians for six months. We first construct, for each tweet, a measure of gender congruence using machine learning methods. We then show that gender congruent tweets receive more feedback using a model with politician and day fixed effects. Furthermore, politicians react to this by sending more gender congruent tweets. Feeding this into a simulation, we demonstrate that the feedback can lead to a widening gap between the messages of male and female politicians.	Aina Gallego

Optimists argue that the internet can serve as a democratizing force in non-democratic regimes by promoting political information, communication, and organization for oppositional forces. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support these claims. Using data from four large Russian surveys conducted over the course of recent elections (November 2011-March 2012), the most contentious period in Russian politics since the early 1990s, we disentangle the concept of electronic political engagement and its impact on political attitudes. We identify five distinctive dimensions of electronic political engagement: web-based political information seeking, web-based political communication, traditional news source usage, and two forms of social networking. However, we find only a limited impact of web-based communication on oppositional viewpoints. These results suggest that electronic political engagement is a complicated, multi-dimensional concept that must be empirically separated. Furthermore, our results throw doubt upon the claim that the internet drives opposition by providing alternative sources of information to government-controlled media.

Yet, we know little about whether, or how, opposition media influence news coverage in state-controlled outlets in autocracies. Do opposition media constrain autocrats, dampening their ability to inject pro-regime bias into news reporting? Or, does the presence of alternative narratives in independent outlets – and even competition for audience time and attention – encourage state media to adopt an even more pro-regime narrative? Leveraging evidence from contemporary Russia, we explore how the launch and abrupt closure of Russia’s most prominent opposition outlet, TV Rain, influenced news coverage in state-controlled outlets. For the empirical analysis, we produced original data on the volume and tone of economic coverage in Russia, by examining more than 200,000 news stories and combining these with monthly indicators of economic performance. We believe this to be the first study to use rigorously collected data on opposition media in order to test hypotheses about the impact of independent outlets on news framing in autocracies. Findings add to recent studies of media manipulation and speak to the broader literature on authoritarian endurance.	Katerina Tertytchnaya

In contrast to the conventional wisdom that more censorship generates more incentives to seek information, this study delineates a paradox: the more perceived information gap, the more likely people appear to be willing to tolerate the internet censorship. We investigate the mechanism through three experimental studies in China. We show that when a vast information gap and harsh restriction is perceived, participants tend to think current internet censorship as being less problematic and more legitimate. We suggest that system justification motivations might explain people’s tendency to tolerate censorship. If the public mainly recognizes the legitimacy of the existing political system, they are motivated to think of their status quo of processing the distorted and limited information resources as tolerable. However, this regularity is conditional: if people lose confidence in the current system, the system justification motivations might not work. Our findings shed light on the complex interaction between political legitimacy and the government’s information manipulation in shaping popular attitudes towards freedom of the press in China and beyond.

This paper describes an approach to explore such content and patterns of discourse through a combination of inductive, retroductive, and deductive manual coding conducted over five stages. The case uses a rhetorical analysis – comprising thematic orientation, message stance, and performative elements – to construct a framework capturing the spectrum of how Twitter users discuss the @Repeal_Shield blocklist’s presence in the 2018 Irish abortion referendum debate. Taking this rhetorical approach allowed for an analysis of how blocklists are understood and debated, depending on users’ own positions and values, in a way that approaches focused solely on structured data elements may not be able to infer. Yet this method, while more interpretive, still requires a systematic approach that goes beyond the observation of themes and patterns.

Hashtags present a viable and accessible means for the collection of deliberately marked contributions to a particular subject of discourse, though researchers acknowledge that the extent of representativeness of such tweets to the wider discussion of a topic is often unknown and subject to usage practices, user behaviours, and community conventions, arising within and without the medium. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, this work examines the practices of inclusion of hashtags in the case studies of Ireland’s 2015 and 2018 referenda on marriage and abortion, respectively. The findings provide a set of insights about the determining factors of hashtag inclusion (and thus the limitations of the representativeness of such tweets to the wider topical discourse), which are in large part generalisable to other studies and may usefully inform research design imperatives for similar investigations. As part of the proposed panel indicated, the application of these findings to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership will be discussed.	Dónal Mulligan

Participation is approached as a motivated discursive construct, in which identity manifests through semantic regularities. I ask if identity language can provide endogenous indicators of the contingencies of participation. The cases studies are discourse of 2018 US elections in Michigan and Ohio, though these methods apply to diverse cases of identity speech online. The Twitter timelines of 20,000 politically interested and localised users are assembled into a corpus of 250 million words plus transactional metadata. From the corpus, local collaborators prepare subcorpora representative of common understandings of Left/Right speech, which are used to train a latent semantic classifier. The classifier measures identity language in the full corpus to provide a longitudinal, network perspective. Enriching the dataset with demographic and electoral data will allow comparison of endogenous indicators with established predictors of participation, and provide insight into the question of participation as identity. In the proposed panel, I will discuss the mapping technique as applied to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership.	J. Clark Powers

Digital political mobilisations can originate on alternative social platforms where virtual communities of practice develop strategies to implement on Twitter, targeting the platforms elite user base, particularly news media that rely on it as a consistent resource. This paper addresses processes of shaping political discourse on Twitter through a range of sophisticated strategies utilised by operatives to engineer the increased salience of an issue in the public-political agenda and exploit opportunities to reframe issues to align with political agendas. It analyses political mobilisations and the flow of information across social media platforms to deploy on Twitter around the topic of #Irexit. It identifies networked virtual communities of practice on other social platforms, a range of strategies employed by political activists and outlines a systematic preparatory process to identify potential explanatory variables that shape what and how discourses manifest. The application of these findings to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership will be discussed as part of the proposed panel indicated.	Niamh Kirk

However, it is not clear how these changing dynamics of revealing preferences affect contentious processes beyond initial mobilisation. We argue that in conflict settings, previously shared social media posts indicating political loyalties can pose a severe risk for civilians. For example, anti-regime messages or display of digital support for the opposition may prove to be life-threatening in government controlled areas. Civilians are likely to strategically alter their social media usage with changing local dynamics of conflict. Drawing on the Twitter activity of users inside Syria between 2013 and 2017 we show how the creation of new accounts and the deletion or disuse of old accounts is empirically linked to changes in territorial control by the armed groups operating across Syria. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the risks - and the potential for civilian agency - when using digital communication in civil conflict.	Anita Gohdes

However, it is not clear how these changing dynamics of revealing preferences affect contentious processes beyond initial mobilisation. We argue that in conflict settings, previously shared social media posts indicating political loyalties can pose a severe risk for civilians. For example, anti-regime messages or display of digital support for the opposition may prove to be life-threatening in government controlled areas. Civilians are likely to strategically alter their social media usage with changing local dynamics of conflict.

Lutscher	University of Konstanz, Germany	p	84493	323	Hot Topics: Cyberattacks on News Websites in Competitive Autocracies	Many authoritarian countries censor news websites. One tactic of internet censorship is a so-called Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, a cyberattack that shuts or slows down websites by flooding an internet server with data traffic. Whereas previous studies only explored other methods of online censorship in closed authoritarian countries, there is no systematic study in competitive regimes that are more prone to subtle and low-cost censorship tactics. This study explores the motivation for DoS attacks on news websites in Venezuela. To this end, I have monitored the status of 19 non-state Venezuelan news websites from November 2017 until June 2018 and retrieved their content every day. Using topic models for short text and rare event logit regression models reveal that in particular higher reporting on topics that question the regime's legitimacy and certain economic topics are positively related to a newspaper's likelihood of being attacked.

Its scope and effectiveness is difficult to assess without a “ground truth” – information that unambiguously identifies participants. We compare two astroturfing campaigns for which we have such information, and which aimed at influencing the 2012 South Korean and the 2016 US presidential elections, respectively. Features that best distinguish the participating accounts from regular users are not their individual characteristics, but patterns of coordination within the campaign, such as tweeting or retweeting similar content at the same time or working regular office hours. We use these empirical regularities to detect additional suspect accounts that are likely part of the campaigns. We analyze the similarities and differences between the two campaign’s online patterns and link them to their internal organization as described in court documents and journalistic investigations. We also compare their respective strategies and their overall effectiveness in influencing public opinion, and find a limited online impact in the South Korean case.	Franziska Keller

However, well-known difficulties with self-selection bias are potentially more severe online, where people can nearly costlessly opt in to (or opt out of) countless news and opinion sources. To address these issues, we designed a pre-registered, randomized field experiment embedded in a nationally representative online panel survey (N = 1,500) in which we encouraged subsets to temporarily alter features of their information environment to make partisan media choices more salient. We then followed up weeks later with post-treatment questions on attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. Using linked data on respondents’ web visits, we are able to precisely measure the treatment effect among compliers and gauge the extent to which their information-seeking habits were altered over time. Our results shed light on the power of relatively small “nudges” in online choice architecture to affect people’s media consumption behavior as well as longstanding attitudes and beliefs.

To this end, we use a structural topic model (STM) to analyze over seventy million tweets collected during the 2017 National elections in France, Germany and the UK. First, we show the robustness of our choice of topics by means of endogenous measures (semantic coherence, exclusivity) and external validations (topic relations, stability of semantic space). Then, we investigate the extent to which politicians and outlets talk about such topics over time (i.e. topic ownership). Further, STM allows us to determine how often a word is used within each topic by each political actor and outlet (i.e. topic alignment). Preliminary results for the UK show that politicians and media outlets tend to tweet about the same topics, yet they differ in the words they use. Specifically, they refer to politicians they are ideologically close to, and express concerns that are consistent with their own beliefs.	Laia Castro

Evidence from an App Selective Trial in Italy	Most research on news diets focuses on the increase in personalization of news feeds. I contrast this emphasis with evidence that the online media environment has shifted significantly in content and I posit that this shift may have important consequences for voters' behavior that can only minimally be offset by users selection. To test this theory I deploy a news aggregator app in which content is randomized among different categories of news, such as soft and hard, to understand how the mix of news impinges on voters demand for news, readership and knowledge. I design a selective trial in in which part of the subject pool is allowed to self-select into treatment, while the rest is exogenously assigned different media diets. The results show that the effect on different news diet is consistent across soft-news and hard-news lovers, meaning that readership is only minimally affected by individual tastes. These results provide new evidence of the effects of the media environment on news diets with implications for democratic competence.	Alessandro Vecchiato

Despite its public relevance, we know very little about the social integration and political behavior of small religious groups. Severe data limitations hamper scientific progress in the study of religious diversity: survey data on religious minority groups tends to be sparse and religious minorities are notoriously hard to reach populations. We propose to apply Multilevel Regression with Poststratification (MRP) to cross-national survey data in order to estimate attitudes of religious minorities over time and across countries. We externally validate this method by using MRP to predict political trust of Muslims in the United Kingdom (UK) based on cross-national survey data and subsequently compare the estimates to results from large-sample national surveys conducted in the UK. The ability to estimate attitudes of small religious groups from openly available cross-national datasets can lay the ground for a better-informed discussion on integration of religious minorities into European societies.

We externally validate this method by using MRP to predict political trust of Muslims in the United Kingdom (UK) based on cross-national survey data and subsequently compare the estimates to results from large-sample national surveys conducted in the UK. The ability to estimate attitudes of small religious groups from openly available cross-national datasets can lay the ground for a better-informed discussion on integration of religious minorities into European societies.

To understand political support for future-oriented policies, it is therefore critical to separately identify the importance of time and risk preferences. The most widespread methods to elicit individual-level time and risk preferences tend to conflate these two forces. A recently proposed solution relies on a costly lab-experimental method, convex time budgets (CTB). We develop, validate, and present a simplified and affordable version of the CTB method for implementation in large surveys. We find that employing hypothetical decisions yields measures of time preferences with nearly identical distributions. However, the theoretically preferred CTB time preference measures correlate only weakly with the most widespread alternative approaches for mass surveys, the staircase method and self-assessment. Finally, we present evidence that the importance of time preferences for predicting support for a variety of future-oriented policies is weaker than is often claimed in studies that rely on stated time preferences.

Evidence from Survey Experiments on Self-Affirmation and Contextualisation	Direct survey measures of sensitive beliefs and behaviours often result in biased estimates. Impression management concerns of respondents vis-à-vis enumerators are generally invoked to explain the observed misreporting. Yet, even in self-administered, anonymous surveys, completed in private, such bias remains. An explanation may be that respondents are unable to admit to themselves that they hold socially unacceptable beliefs, or have engaged in socially undesirable behaviour. This paper investigates whether misreporting of electoral turnout, a well-established sensitive survey item, in online surveys can be reduced by strengthening and buffering a respondent’s self-integrity against the perceived psychological threat of admitting to having not voted. Drawing on evidence from survey experiments and accompanying vote validation studies run after the 2016 UK EU referendum, we find that neither a self-affirmation exercise nor contextualisation of the turnout question significantly improves reporting accuracy. This suggests that sensitivity bias in anonymous online surveys is unlikely to be due to self-admission concerns. Our findings also highlight the limits of self-affirmation exercises and point towards satisficing as a source of measurement error.	Patrick Kuhn, Samuel Mellish, Nick Vivyan

Most applications jointly scale respondents in a single common space. However, these applications also often highlight that such scaling exercises are better suited for some than for others – the individual responses of some are more in line with underlying dimensions than those of others. This phenomenon could be a consequence of varying dimensionalities across respondents – while the responses of some may be structured by a single dimension, those of others may be structured by multiple latent dimensions. I extend established multidimensional IRT models to allow such heterogeneity via a latent mixture model. Doing so allows the analysis of which respondents move in less and which in more complex political spaces. Importantly, the results underline that public opinion should be considered not as a single space for all, but as a mixture of political spaces.	Garret Binding

There is a consensus that, by 1990, most of those parties abandoned the right-wing position regarding distributive issues and embraced a welfare state defense. However, this position differs from traditional left-wing parties and usually combines nativism, authoritarianism and populism. Accordingly, studies have confirmed that welfare chauvinism is an important element of RRWPs’ attitude in the social policy domain. Not surprisingly, quantitative analyses have found positive relationship between RRWPs’ government participation and the adoption of restrictions on immigrants’ entitlement to social rights. Nevertheless, qualitative studies suggest that the translation of RRWPs’ policy preferences in policy outputs is more complex. Literature has pointed the role of institutions, RRWPs’ bargain power, and mainstream parties’ policy position to explain changes on immigrants’ access to welfare state. Therefore, this piece aims to disentangle the relation between RRWPs’ government participation and the adoption of welfare chauvinist policies. It relies on an in-depth study of Austrian and Danish cases.	Juliana Chueri

Is this effect of falling behind distinct from social class? One of the areas into which inequalities have taken a strong hold has been the volatility of jobs under risk. However, much of the immigration attitudes literature have struggled to conceptualise and study the effect of a labour market competition effect on attitudes. To remedy the shortcomings of the previous work, I investigate how worries stemming from falling behind and the effect of social class distinctly translate into immigration attitudes. The paper contributes to what we know about attitude formation and risk by, first, presenting an original theorisation of economic risk with an objective comparison point and dynamic element. Second, I study the causal effects of worker’s status by presenting evidence from the 1999-2015 waves of the German Socio-economic Panel and juxtaposing the variance in relative risk exposures of an individual compared to the rest of the national labour market and the stability of social class over time.

However, so far, only few studies outside of the U.S. context address the political preferences of immigrants and how they differ from natives. In particular, little attention has been given to the role of macro-factors in explaining differences of immigrants’ policy preferences across host countries. This paper seeks to address these existing gaps in the literature by looking into the role of integration policies and economic conditions in explaining cross-country variations of differences in political attitudes between immigrants and natives. Using European Social Survey data (2002-2016) in 16 European countries, I hypothesize that better economic conditions and liberal integration policies in the host country reduce attitudinal gaps between immigrants and natives. Generating an overview of attitudes encompassing simultaneously economic, cultural and immigration-specific issues, I suggest that immigrants’ political integration is not only shaped by individual factors, but that also structural policies influence how political preferences of immigrants converge towards natives.

Many see these laws as targeting Muslim women. This study examines the effect these policies have on public attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants. We argue these laws affect public attitudes in two ways. First, following research that suggests that public policy outputs influence public opinion and attitudes, we argue that laws restricting face coverings signal to the public that Muslims are members of a social out-group, leading the public in these countries to become more negative towards Muslims and immigrants, generally. Second, we theorize that these effects diffuse across borders. When a country adopts restrictions on face coverings, the publics in neighboring countries also become more negative towards Muslims. To test these propositions, we draw on Pew and Eurobarmeter public opinion data to measure public affect towards Muslims and immigrants across 15 EU countries from 2009-2016. The results provide a deeper understanding of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe, as well as a greater knowledge of the effect of governmental policy outputs on public opinion and attitudes.

In this study, we investigate how people process new information on asylum seekers through a novel survey experiment that disentangles politically motivated learning, rational learning and motivated responding. First, we implement a covariance detection task, as recently developed by Kahan et al. (2017), on the topic of asylum seekers: Respondents are asked to interpret a 2x2 table about the relationship between asylum seekers and crime rates. Crucially, respondents are randomly allocated to evaluate a conclusion that triggers their identity-protective stakes or not. This design allows us to disentangle politically motivated learning from other forms of learning. Second, we extend this design by testing for motivated responding. We randomly provide respondents with incentives and different response-formats to motivate them to report their inference truthfully. This design element aims at disentangling whether respondents learn in a politically motivated fashion or whether they learn correctly yet give answers that are congenial to pre-existing beliefs. Our research has important implications for research on polarization, political psychology, but also survey methodology.	Konstantin Glinitzer, Markus Wagner

The paper will use the extensive data bases provided by the OECD, specifically through the use of OECD.stat. Of specific importance will be the variation in attainment and achievement gender differences in reading and math and the relationships between the two variables. The standard results of such studies worldwide indicate that girls outperform boys in reading, literacy and writing skills, while the reverse is true for math and science. We first explore if this is still correct in the most recent OECD results and then analyze the covariance of the two variables by country. We specifically analyze countries where the inverse correlations are not present; i.e. those countries where girls seem to outperform or equally perform boys in both or neither subjects. The OECD data sets provide a full set of country-level data to help explain the varying differences.	John Witte

Governments frequently enact policies to either encourage or discourage the use of particular technologies. E.g., governments have adopted climate policy measures to discourage the use of fossil fuels, promote renewables, and associated technologies, such as low emission vehicles. We focus on policies promoting electric vehicles, which is politically very contentious as it deeply affects citizens’ private sphere. Specifically, we study whether and how public support for these government policies changes when citizens receive information about the financing of such policies, notably for costly voluntary pull measures. Based on the theory of budgetary illusion, we argue that public support is likely to drop. This arguments is tested based on a conjoint experiment fielded to a unique random sample of 4000 conventional car and 1500 electric car holders in Switzerland. The main finding is that policy support does in fact decrease when cost implications are communicated. Surprisingly, however, this does not hold true for pull measures that are not supported when financing is not mentioned. This hints towards a cost anticipation for disliked policies while costs are ignored when policies are supported.	Gracia Brückmann

In private and semi-private pension systems such as the one in Chile, individuals can tailor their pension modes to their needs – four diﬀerent pension schemes, multiple providers, guaranteed periods, among others. However, this ﬂexibility requires retirees to make a lot of diﬃcult decisions and more than 80% of people end up paying large sums for delegating those choices to a pensions adviser or a sales agent, and still not selecting the alternatives that give them the highest present value (FNE, 2018). We argue that one reason for these ‘selections errors’ is the way information is displayed to individuals and, that by simplifying information, these ‘errors’ can be reduced. To test this hypothesis we conduct an online experiment in which participants (aged 55-70) are incentivized to make decisions on simulated pension offers. The treatments include a Control, three different variations on the metrics used to display information and one change of format.	Denise Laroze

In private and semi-private pension systems such as the one in Chile, individuals can tailor their pension modes to their needs – four diﬀerent pension schemes, multiple providers, guaranteed periods, among others. However, this ﬂexibility requires retirees to make a lot of diﬃcult decisions and more than 80% of people end up paying large sums for delegating those choices to a pensions adviser or a sales agent, and still not selecting the alternatives that give them the highest present value (FNE, 2018).

Public Opinion, Tax Reform, and Representation	Most government legislation does not affect citizens equally. Tax reforms, for example, often have a disproportionately large impact on certain taxpayer groups, while only bringing about marginal benefits to the collectivity. At the same time, concrete policy effects (e.g., on a citizen’s pocketbook) coexist alongside varying levels of ideological attachment: some people are clearly more invested in certain policy issues and outcomes than others, even in the absence of a direct personal effect. This observation gives rise to a fundamental question about how democracy should work: should citizens who are disproportionately affected by, or even just especially interested in, a certain policy change be given a disproportionate amount of influence over that reform? This paper examines public opinion on this issue using a national survey experiment fielded in the US. To do so, the study: (1) presents a hypothetical tax reform bill to respondents; (2) varies both the consultation type (none/constituency polling/consulting interested constituents/consulting affected constituents) and the bill’s fate (pass/fail); and (3) compares outcome satisfaction and perceived fairness across the treatment groups.

Therefore, it is essential to understand under which conditions political elites pay attention to an issue, and importantly, the role played by the type of information in shaping their attention patterns. Various fields of research from agenda-setting, interest groups, to policy diffusion, show how empirical evidence is key in the policy-process. However, most of this work is based at the macro level, with scarce evidence of how political elites respond to different types of information at the individual level. The aim of this paper is to cover this gap by analysing to what extent empirical information gathers policy-maker attention and response. We use a field experiment on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) embedded in a real-life fundraising campaign. Results suggest that MEPs are significantly less attentive and respond less to information that contains evidence cues rather than that presented as general ideas. Results also suggest that there are no important differences between political groups, and crucially, on being in favour or against a specific policy proposal.	Leire Rincón García

Experimental Evidence on the Effect of Public Service Motivation, Political Ideology and Public Sector Affiliation	Equal employment policies (EEP) are a widespread tool to improve representative bureaucracy by supporting applicants from marginalized groups to enter public service. Critics of EEPs argue that these polices undermine the merit principle, which is traditionally at the center of public hiring. We address this debate in two steps: First, we test the effect of Public Service Motivation (PSM) and political ideology on support for specific EEPs (quota, encouragement and self-commitment). Second, we conduct a framing experiment to identify the alleged trade-off between merit recruitment and the representation of migrants in the public service. Evidence from a sample of 1200 subjects (including public and private sector employees, as well as students of public administration) shows the following: First, support for active EEPs increases with PSM and a leftist orientation. Second, support for merit recruitment increases in the trade-off frame. Third, the framing effect is conditioned by subjects’ political ideology. Right-leaning subjects show some significant reactance; as they are overemphasizing merit recruitment in the migrants’ bureaucratic representation frame.	Markus Tepe

However, widely accepted notions of reputation and autonomy in public administration are under-theorized and ignore democratic contexts. In order to address these shortcomings, this study adds to literature in two ways: Theoretically, it develops a framework, which emphasizes pluralistic values and external evaluation that are fundamental for the study of public administration in the space of democracy. Thus, I argue that reputation ultimately depends on public opinion of the whole democratic audience, rather than on evaluations of specific groups - a view that violates the democratic fundamental “one person, one vote”. Empirically, the paper assesses reputation and autonomy of the European Commission over a 30-year period, relying on perceptions (Eurobarometer) and institutional (publicly available) data, which challenge the conventional one-way causality claimed by former work. In combination the theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that reputation and autonomy’s relationship is not straight-forward and advance conventional definitions by considering fundamental democratic values that are indispensable in public administration.

Drawing insights from policy performance theory of Pippa Norris, four hypotheses were developed in which satisfaction with democracy was dependent variable and welfare goals, economic consequences of social benefits, misuse of welfare programs and social protection served as predictor variables. By analyzing data that came from two waves of European Social Survey (ESS 4 and ESS 8) through Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, it was found that social protection was the chief predictor of satisfaction. Moreover, citizens’ level of satisfaction was found to be least dependent on economic consequences of the benefits they receive. In contrast to the quite weak yet positive association between welfare goals and satisfaction; a negative association was observed between satisfaction and misuse of welfare benefits. Various threats and opportunities, that decision-makers can endanger while procuring welfare finances have been outlined towards the conclusion.	Bilal Hassan

Scholars have long been focussed on studying lobbying and potential influence that such activities can have on public policy. The ability to lobby state actors, however, critically depends on having access to them in the first place. While not being sufficient, access is a necessary condition for successful lobbying. So far much of the theoretical and empirical literature has been dedicated to money in politics, while potential mechanisms of acquiring access are usually limited to some form of financial transactions. In this study I focus on the case of the UK, where due to campaign spending limits, the influence of money is, arguably, more limited than in other pluralist systems. I use a new dataset created from government transparency reports for 2010-2017 that comprises some 100’000 contacts between cabinet ministers and interest groups, linked with organisation-level data. I argue that when financial incentives are small, other organisations’ characteristics, such as economic importance, long history of corporate-government relationships and ideological proximity play an important role in acquiring access to decision makers.

In this paper, I propose that agencies with a stronger institutional capacity – i.e., endowed with more independence and competences – are more likely to influence legislation, and this effect is moderated by the characteristics of the market in which they operate. I develop a spatial model that shows that such agencies are more likely to draw the final legislative output closer to their ideal points. Empirically, I test this argument by looking at the impact of Independent Regulatory Authorities (IRAs) on the liberalisation of the railway industry in Europe, using the institutional capacity of IRAs in other network industries as instrumental variables. By employing computer-based text analysis techniques, I also introduce a novel approach to the estimation of IRAs’ ideal points, thus offering a flexible empirical strategy to measure the ideology of the bureaucracy and its influence on legislative outputs. The findings show that IRAs with stronger institutional capacity that regulate sufficiently liberalised markets are more likely to exert influence over legislation.	Luca Bellodi

Current works assessing the link between EU transfers and political corruption focus primarily on the impact of EU funds on recipient states' patterns of political corruption and do not engage with the question of how EU funds interact with political corruption to shape party dynamics in EU’s recipient member-states. In this paper, I take into account the degree of executive corruption across recipient states to examine the impact of EU fiscal allocations on domestic politics and governing parties' electoral outcomes. I propose a novel theory whereby fiscal allocations to corrupt recipient states deliver political latitude that incumbents utilize to advance their electoral outcomes and governing authority. Examining data on EU fiscal allocations over the period of 2000-2015, I find that fiscal transfers to EU member states are correlated with higher electoral margins for incumbents in corrupt countries. I interpret this as suggestive of misallocation of EU transfers by corrupt parties to buffer their political latitude over the opposition. ​	Albana Shehaj

I argue that in firms with more specific assets the economic interests of employers and employees will be more aligned, as the fate of jobs is tied more closely to the firm. Therefore, individuals working in firms with high asset specificity are more likely to share political preferences with their employers. However, simultaneously observing both company and employee preferences is difficult in practice. I match 1,691,790 campaign contribution filings of 85,109 employees to 874 publicly listed firms using US campaign finance data between 2003 and 2016. I accomplish this by employing natural language processing to automatically identify employers and occupations. Holding constant individual occupation, I find that employees in companies with more specific assets are more aligned with their employer, and that most variation in alignment is at the industry-level. The results confirm long-standing expectations from trade theory about firm structure and political alignment and stress the continuing importance of sector-based models for political preference formation.

This was because business donors were overwhelmingly concerned with the left-right dimension and enjoyed stable relationships with centre-right parties. These parties are increasingly tempted by nationalist positions on a globalisation dimension. This new ideological flux provides an opportunity to measure the extent to which donors are party identifiers or react to changes in the policy space. Dramatic shifts in party policy on both dimensions and a relatively transparent political finance regime make the UK a particularly apposite case to study this question. I analyse 19,000 donations to the Conservative Party and show that business donors reacted strongly to recent shifts on both the left-right and globalisation dimensions. Thus, centre-right parties may not be able to rely on party identification and their left-right position to maintain business funding. Economic nationalism is likely to cost centre-right parties money.	Iain McMenamin

A Spatial Approach to Study Party Finance Structures	The funding of political parties is of great significance for elections as well as the functioning of representative democracies. Although the comparative study of party finance structures provides insights into how parties manage money over time, existing studies solely descriptively looked at incomes and expenditures. Assuming that condensed data on finance structures contribute to a better understanding of party organisations, the paper elaborates methodological approaches to effectively capture revenues and expenses. Therefore, I suggest using distance matrices to assess parties’ proximity in terms of incomes and expenses. Principal component analysis and clustering enables to construct a compromised party finance space, making comparative studies feasible. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, I apply the method to German parties between 1995 and 2016 based on public accounting reports. It can be shown that parties’ income and expense strategies diverge towards elections and converge subsequently. In addition to this finance cycle, the analysis finds party finance types. I propose using the method for further comparative studies within and across countries.	Marc S. Jacob

Evidence from Brazilian municipal employees	This paper examines the extent to which anti-corruption audits effectively remove corrupt bureaucrats from office. We analyze the impact of 10 years of randomized anti-corruption audits on the career paths of 2.2 million Brazilian municipal employees. While previous studies show that audits remove corrupt politicians from office, we show that their impact on corrupt bureaucrats is weak. Dismissal and departure rates in municipalities found innocent are comparable to non-audited ones. However, bureaucrats in corrupt municipalities have longer tenure than those non-audited. After an audit, dismissal and departure rates immediately catch-up with those of non-audited municipalities for low-skilled workers. For high-skilled bureaucrats, rates catch up in the next electoral term, if a mayor from opposition wins, suggesting higher removal costs. We develop a new method to estimate the probability of a non-audited municipality to be corrupt. Corrupt bureaucrats may preempt the audits by putting up protections or departing early. We quantify these effects with a career choice model. Results suggest that while anti-corruption campaigns may be effective at removing political kingpins, they are less effective in eliminating their bureaucratic accomplices.	Romain Ferrali

It is a prevalent viewpoint that wealth inequality leads to political inequality. However, as changes to wealth inequality are often endogenous to other phenomena, the political consequences of wealth concentration are hard to study. In this article, I exploit a Danish land reform of 1919 which by law confiscated 20-25 percent of the net value of historically entailed estates. Exploiting the geographical variation in the density of these estates, using difference-in-difference estimation, I am able to assess the local political effects of this shock to wealth inequality. However, contrary to the argument that economic inequality leads to political inequality, I find no effect on decreases in wealth inequality for local political inequality. Instead, the expansion of the franchise during this period strongly affects political equality and also seems to have limited the power of the estate owners. These results cast doubt on whether wealth inequality actually matters for political equality in the context of widely held political rights and strong rule of law.	Lasse Aaskoven

Influence of the structure and the level of income inequalities on redistributive behavior.	Although income inequality has been growing since the 1970s, demands for more redistributive policies have stagnated. While many scholars looked at macroeconomic factors, only a few focused on the cognitive mechanisms behind preferences for redistribution. Previous studies from behavioral and political economists highlighted two crucial factors in shaping redistributive preferences: the perceived fairness of inequalities and the structure of the unequal distribution. Building on this literature, we argue that individuals adjust their expectation of legitimate inequalities to the level of inequalities they are exposed to, while they have a consistent aversion towards positively skewed distribution. We test these propositions using 'spectator/worker' experimental designs. Study 1 (N= 185), analyze the role of the level of inequality and its skewness on redistributive behavior. Our next studies are investigating the interplay between ideology and self-interest on the adjustment and the skew aversion mechanisms. Our approach combines recent theories and methods from behavioral economy, and political sciences and aims at understanding how and when individuals are judging inequalities as fair and how existing inequalities are affecting their behavior and preferences.

Second, we expect that this relationship will be moderated by individuals’ party preferences. The relationship between institutional learning and democratic preferences should be stronger for those who support parties that are/have been in government. Since majoritarian systems consistently block small parties, the differences in terms of preferences for coalition vs. single-party governments between the supporters of large and small parties should be larger in majoritarian countries.

In this regard, it is often argued that ordinary citizens will act as a strong bulwark against such developments and protect democracy. However, little is known about the ability of citizens to detect and evaluate such democratic backsliding. In a conjoint experiment with representative samples of 1000 respondents in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Denmark, and Spain, I test citizens’ ability to detect incremental regression on different dimensions of democracy: the fairness of elections (e.g., voter registration, campaign finance, and availability of polling stations), civil liberties (e.g., freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and the media), and the rule of law (e.g., the nomination and independence of judges). Specifically, I present several fictional newspaper articles describing the occurrence of democratic backsliding in the respondents’ home country on these different dimensions of democracy, and asses both whether they are able to detect democratic regression at all, and whether they are more sensitive to some forms of regression than others.

Turnout rates substantially differ across districts within countries due to their different social or demographic composition (i.e, urbanization, average wage, employment or elderly population) and local cleavages. However, cross-national research summarizes this distribution with a single number, the national turnout rate. We argue that turnout rate differences across districts makes an important difference for party systems. Grofman et al. (1997) have shown that when turnout rate differences across districts are linked to the partisan vote shares in those districts, certain parties are more likely to have 'cheap seats' vis-à-vis turnout. We expand such argument and using data from the last lower-house election in all democracies in the world, we show that turnout rate differences increase electoral disproportionality and reduce the number of parties. When examining the determinants of turnout rate differences, we find that they are correlated with the degree of political and economic decentralization.	Ferran Martinez i Coma

Turnout rates substantially differ across districts within countries due to their different social or demographic composition (i.e, urbanization, average wage, employment or elderly population) and local cleavages. However, cross-national research summarizes this distribution with a single number, the national turnout rate. We argue that turnout rate differences across districts makes an important difference for party systems. Grofman et al. (1997) have shown that when turnout rate differences across districts are linked to the partisan vote shares in those districts, certain parties are more likely to have 'cheap seats' vis-à-vis turnout.

While such correlations are illustrative they do not tell us whether employment affects or whether there is some other factor that affects both employment and turnout. We identify the effects of jobs on tUrnout by collaborating with large companies in Ethiopia to randomly assign jobs to female applicants. In the presentation I will present results from the first six month follow up.	Andreas Kotsadam

There is little to no research on how democratic maturity together with other country’s characteristics influence political participation, when it comes to a cross-national study across EU countries targeting young people. In this paper, I outline an empirical analysis exploring the effect of institutional factors (e.g. democratic maturity, electoral systems, and corruption) on the propensity of young individuals to engage in formal and informal mode of political participation. The majority of research on institutional factors as determinants of political participation focuses mostly on voting as a political action. Such theoretical and empirical gaps are addressed in my paper. I develop a comparative perspective on youth (dis)engagement in politics and suggest that institutional context matter and fundamentally condition the way young people participate in politics. To assess these claims, I analyse cross-national data over time from the European Social Survey (2002–2016) and an original dataset on institutional-level variables, on youth participation in politics in 13 EU countries by applying multilevel logistic regression.

Evidence from a Diff-in-Discontinuities Design at the local level in Italy	We study the effect of term limits on voter turnout in local Italian elections. Since 2014 the Italian law allows mayors in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants to re-run for a third term, whereas mayors in cities with a number of residents above the cutoff still face a two-term limit. The introduction of the reform permits us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design exploiting the before/after with the discontinuous policy change. We find that voters negatively react to the introduction of the reform and in particular electoral participation decreases by about 5 percentage points in municipalities eligible to the treatment compared to municipalities in the control group. This negative effect is essentially driven by a decrease in the political competition. We also find that relaxing term limits does not improve the quality of politicians running for election.

Does the act of voting matter in these regimes? Namely, does the nature of electoral competition and regime-sponsored voter mobilization shape “habitual” voting? Using the Russian case, and leveraging evidence from the universe of elections taking place in the country from 1930s onwards, we consider the impact of early-life electoral experiences on citizen life-long voting propensities. To estimate generational turnout differences, we use hierarchical age period cohort analysis and apply semi-parametric generalized additive models to harmonized public opinion survey data spanning over two decades of Russian elections (1991-2012). We compare the mobilizing effects of communist era elections against those of Putin-era elections, in which extensive electoral mobilization has been noted. We also consider sub-national variations in electoral competition using multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP). Findings have implications for understanding the role of authoritarian elections in shaping voter behavior and for understanding habitual voting more generally.	Ksenia Northmore-Ball

Ideological Americans might disagree sharply, or they might not even understand one another. This paper applies an Ideological Turing Test to delegates at a number of state conventions. The test follows the logic of the Turing Test in computer science. Alan Turing proposed that any true artificial intelligence would be able to fool an interlocutor that it is in fact human. Similarly, we might think that an ideologue who really understands their opponents would be able to fool them into thinking they agree. We thus asked respondents to describe the views of liberals and conservatives on a number of issues, and then presented these open-ended items to acknowledged ideologues, who judged their accuracy.

For example, the success of a radical right party can provide new and surprising information about other citizens’ preferences. In this paper, we consider when elections act as information mechanisms. To do so, we look at data from Google Trends. Specifically, we consider when citizens search for information on specific political parties in the days after an election. We construct a database of search activity after elections in EU countries since 2000 and match this to data on political parties from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. We show that voters are more likely to look for information on party when it just entered parliament, when it entered the parliament for the first time and when it is more extreme than other parties. These results help us understand when elections stimulate information-seeking, with potential consequences for citizen attitudes.	Markus Wagner

How do rival parties’ characterization of each other’s policy positions affect voter perceptions of party positions? Parties are engaged in constant exchange with their rivals about their policy positions. This creates possibilities for rival parties to misconstrue each other’s policy message. However, we do not know what effect such misconstruction has on voters. We argue that the effect of such message distortion by rival parties on voters’ perceptions of party positions depends on two factors. First, following the motivated reasoning literature, we argue that partisans pay more attention to their own party messages, and independents are the most malleable group to rival party distortion of party messages. Second, we state that the effect of issue distortion is greatest for less salient issues when voters do not know a lot about parties’ positions. Using original observational data on parties’ campaign rhetoric from 10 European democracies, and survey experiments conducted in the UK, we test these expectations. Our results have important implications for our understanding of party campaign strategies and their voter-level consequences.	Zeynep Somer-Topcu

Previous studies find that the mere exposure to and the reception of party policy-related information is not sufficient for updating individuals’ perceptions of party positions, but rather, various characteristics of recipients interact to reinforce and change such perceptions. Among these characteristics, this paper focuses on the role of belief strength. Specifically, we examine whether and how pre-existing self-confidence in the knowledge of the positions of political parties leads to different consequences in updating policy positions. In our original survey experiment with a representative sample of UK citizens, respondents receive different sets of policy (budget) information. More importantly, we measure their belief strength on their placements of themselves and political parties on the ideological and policy dimensions before and after the information treatment. From this survey experiment we aim to find how the role of information in updating party policy positions varies upon the strength of initial beliefs in the perception of party policy positions and, further, to identify different updating patterns of individuals upon their characteristics.

Facing the rise of anti-establishment movements in politics around the world, this question seems have increasingly gained its weight in the study of comparative politics. This paper focuses on the rise of the Workers’ Party (PT) and its implications for static and dynamic party nationalization in contemporary Brazil (1986 – 2014). Two testable hypotheses will be drawn. The first hypothesis predicts that, contrary to dominant paradigms in the study of party nationalization, elite incentives to coordinate cross-district or district-specific campaigns should be dependent on the brand image of the party to run legislative candidates. The second hypothesis, thereby, predicts that the more each candidate weights party brands rather than own resources in legislative elections, the more likely the party will achieve the higher degree of static and dynamic nationalization. By estimating the individual and partisan effects of elite incentives on party nationalization with the two-level mixed-effect modelling, this seeks to demonstrate those hypotheses with the Brazilian Legislative Surveys (1990 – 2013).

THE RISE OF THE SAP IN SWEDISH LOCAL ELECTIONS, 1910-18	Employing fine-grained, group-level data recorded in local elections between 1910 and 1918, we explore the social and geographical basis of the rise of Swedish social democracy and the overall formation of the Sweden’s 20th century party system. In spite of the electoral reform of 1909, which introduced quasi-universal male suffrage, plural voting continued to be employed in local elections during the 1910s. Voters, who were divided into 40 income grades, received as many ballots as the number of his income grade. Exploiting the published records of electoral behavior by income rank in those elections, we explore the structure of support for social democracy, liberalism and conservatism. Socialist vote was strongly correlated with income rank – but varied across geographical area, as a result of unionization and the nature of associational life.	Zsuzsanna Magyar

THE RISE OF THE SAP IN SWEDISH LOCAL ELECTIONS, 1910-18	Employing fine-grained, group-level data recorded in local elections between 1910 and 1918, we explore the social and geographical basis of the rise of Swedish social democracy and the overall formation of the Sweden’s 20th century party system. In spite of the electoral reform of 1909, which introduced quasi-universal male suffrage, plural voting continued to be employed in local elections during the 1910s. Voters, who were divided into 40 income grades, received as many ballots as the number of his income grade. Exploiting the published records of electoral behavior by income rank in those elections, we explore the structure of support for social democracy, liberalism and conservatism.

Partisanship and policy preferences in the context of party formation	It is well-established that policy preferences and party identification influence each another. Yet the relationship between policy preferences and party identification has not been fully examined in the context of party formation. Therefore, we know little about the individual-level mechanisms by which new party entry influences partisan realignment. This article examines the development of party identification with nascent radical right parties and its relationship to preferences towards immigration and European integration. The empirical analysis focuses on the Dutch PVV, the German AfD, and the British UKIP. We make use of long panel data to observe whether changes in issue attitudes cause changes in party identification or vice versa. Preliminary results show that cross-pressured voters who hold anti-immigrant or Eurosceptic attitudes subsequently identify with a radical right party. In contrast, citizens who feel politically alienated develop stronger anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic attitudes only after they identify with a radical right party. By explaining the heterogeneity of voter responses to new party formation, our findings contribute to a general theory of partisan realignment in multiparty democracies.	Giorgio Malet, Philipp Dreyer

In this paper, I study the extent to which these institutional factors impact individual citizens' evaluation of the work carried out by each branch of government. I reason that individual citizens will evaluate a branch of government controlled by ideologically distant elected officials in a particularly negative way when it possesses the institutional powers necessary to change policy in its preferred direction. Leveraging variation in institutional designs in 11 Latin American democracies and using data from 17 AmericasBarometer surveys, I find that institutional designs affect individual citizens' perceptions of the work conducted by the president and the legislature, which should affect how they punish or reward elected officials for their actions.

Police brutality and mayoral approval in American cities	Does police performance affect mayoral approval? Do citizens hold mayors accountable when they are dissatisfied with the police? Despite the established body of research on executive approval, little is known about how public opinion on a particular bureaucratic branch - police department in this case - affects mayoral leadership. Past research suggests a positive association between police performance and mayoral approval. However, recent incidents on police violence challenge this straightforward relationship, as mayors tend to distance themselves from police brutality and promise to reform the police department. Using comparable survey data in Chicago and New York, this paper examines the relationship between police performance and mayoral approval. Results find siginificant differences between the two cities: While police performance positively affects mayoral approval in Chicago, it is inversely related in New York City. This divergence, I argue, may stem from the distinct political structure of the two cities and calls for a close look at how institutional differences can influence public opinion at the local level.

Media Scrutiny and Government Responsiveness During Scandals	How do government institutions respond to media scrutiny in the face of scandals? Do they 'clamp down' on transparency in attempt to minimize negative information becoming public, or do they 'open up' in attempt to bolster their credibility? We answer this question using novel data from the Mexican federal government. We first develop novel measures of media scrutiny and scandal incidence based on a corpus of 350,000 news articles pertaining to 25 Mexican federal ministries, identifying scandals based on bursts of negative media attention. We then evaluate government responsiveness using administrative data on over one million requests for government information over a twelve year period, with their associated responses. For each scandal onset, we can compare not only affected and unaffected ministries both before and after, but also examine information requests that are already 'in the queue' when the scandal begins, offering unique empirical leverage. This research design will offer important new findings on government responsiveness at crucial moments of heightened public interest.	Daniel Berliner

Through the implementation of a synthetic control method and an “Unexpected Event During Surveys Design” this study aims to contribute to the debate on whether citizens can single out responsibilities for the failures of individual politicians. The paper draws on extensive data on the evaluation of Spanish Ministers, and it exploits the coincidence of the failure of the Spanish Health Minister to manage a crisis with the fieldwork of a representative survey. Given that the day at which respondent are surveyed is as if-random, this crisis represents a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of political fiascos on citizens’ attitudes. The results indicate that: (i) policy failures have a strong impact on the evaluation and name recognition of politicians; (ii) citizens are able to single out responsibilities for specific policy failures; (iii) policy failures change the foundations of citizens’ evaluations, who become less likely to rely on heuristics.

The public perception of immigration being a major issue increased accordingly throughout the member states although some countries were only slightly affected. This study combines newspaper-content from eight EU countries from 2012-2017 with eight waves of cross-national surveys aiming at explaining the effect of newspaper content on the public perception. Focussing on both first- and second-level agenda-setting the effect of the media attention and party frames the results suggest that both volume of media attention to immigration and the actors engaged in the debate had a significant impact on the public perception of the migration crisis and the public preference for imposing additional measures to fight irregular immigration. Further, investigating the moderating effect of left-/right-position reveals that frames supporting tougher immigration had polarising effects, while EU integration frames had depolarising effects.

In the complex EU multilevel structure, citizens differ in their perceptions of who is responsible for policy outcomes. The media plays a crucial role in providing citizens with relevant information for attributing responsibility. Policy responsibility consists of two concepts, functional and causal responsibility. While the latter has been studied in the context of ‘blaming Europe’ for negative outcomes, the necessary condition of functional responsibility, i.e. the level of actual decision-making power, has received scant attention. Similar to the media’s influence on causal responsibility perceptions, the media should be even more decisive for the neutral perception regarding functional responsibility. We consider the case of the Netherlands using survey data including perceived levels of decision-making power between the European and national level for five policy areas: Immigration, social welfare, economy, terrorism and Europe. We link this with data from an automated media content analysis of major Dutch newspapers and news websites. With regression models we predict the effect of exposure to policy-related information on the European level (as a weighted ratio compared to the national level) on policy-level attribution (incl. controls).

The present study examines the opinion leadership potential of political leaders’ Instagram posts from the theoretical framework of electronic word-of-mouth communication, tie strength, and homophily (Brown & Reingen, 1987; Granovetter, 1973; Valenzuela, Correa, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2017). Opinion leadership is a function of the strength or weakness of leaders’ relationships with followers and the degree to which leaders and followers share similar attributes. A survey of those who follow political leaders on Instagram will measure the influence of leaders’ posts on followers’ political views, and that influence will also be compared with more traditional sources of opinion leadership, such as friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances. The findings will also show which actions leaders’ posts most trigger, such as liking and commenting, and how demographics and political attitudes influence followers’ actions.

Comparing communicative interactions by supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Reddit	The international rise of populism has in part been attributed to digital media. They are seen as allowing populists’ supporters to share and distribute information independent from media organizations or elites and as offering communication spaces in which they can support each other and strengthen communal ties irrespective of their societal standing. This raises the question whether populists’ supporters use digital media differently from other groups, given the importance of digital media for them. This could, for example, find expression in the intensity of digital media use, content of conversations, levels of support and caring expressed by and for community members, degree of incivility directed at outsiders, and mirroring of the “populist communication style” attributed to populist elite communication. We examine this on Reddit by comparing linguistic patterns and content in two subreddits focusing on a populist, Donald Trump, and a center-left politician, Hillary Clinton, during the US-presidential election 2016.

The Media’s Talk of Populism and Its Influence on Public Opinion	Populism has become a popular word in the political debate. However, its meaning and its connotations are unclear. This paper examines the use of the term populism in the Spanish print media and the consequences of a policy or political actor being labelled as populist. Our analyses draw on an original dataset of all newspaper articles containing the words populism and populist and were published between 2013 and 2017. Through a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and the manual coding of a sample of these articles we explore the way in which the term is used, which actors it is associated with, and whether it involves negative or positive connotations. Based on the finding that the term is frequently used in a pejorative way, we conduct two survey experiments to assess the consequences of a policy or actor being labeled as populist. Results show that individuals are less likely to support a policy or political actor when it is labelled as populist and that the effects of the populist label are independent from the use of a populist rhetoric.

The rise of European radical right parties co-occurs with the 2015 refugee protection crisis and a notable change of tone in immigration debates. Pundits and journalists even alleged that some of the language and images used by radical right parties are reminiscent of pre-WWII fascist politicians’ language. Most prominently Alexander Gauland, leader of the German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), has been accused of having borrowed from Hitler. In this paper, we assess the validity of the accusations by drawing on quantitative text analysis methods. Moreover, we use those analyses to address fundamental questions about the importance of collective memory in the development of contemporary anti-immigrant discourses. We do so by utilizing the full set of Hitler’s speeches between 1925-1933 and the speeches of German politicians in the Bundestag, including Gauland, since 2010. Tracking exclusionary rhetoric and figures of thought from Hitler to contemporary politicians’ speeches, we show which topics have been reintroduced by the AfD. These findings are particularly important in times of rising populism and increasing prevalence of exclusionary attitudes.	Judith Spirig

Participants in the treatment groups were exposed to some of the ads produced by European institutions. All ads present a positive image of the European integration process. However, while some ads directly emphasized how citizens benefit from this process (e.g. no roaming), others emphasized the reduced costs of European integration. Our findings indicate that all ads significantly increase diffuse support for European integration. However, the effect of the ads emphasizing the benefits of European integration are stronger than those highlighting its reduced costs. Moreover, the analyses indicate that the positive effect of the ads on diffuse support for European integration are mediated by changes in the perception of the costs and benefits of EU integration for one’s own country.

The impact of state of origin on senators’ speeches in the Australian Federal Parliament (1901 - 2018)	When Australia federated in 1901, the Senate (upper house) of the Australian Federal Parliament was envisaged as a house to represent the interests of the constituent states. To investigate the efficacy of this we analyse how what is said in the Senate is affected by the state the senator represents and how this has changed over time. We codify two data sources to create a new dataset of who said what in the Australian Federal Parliament between 1901 and 2018. Using the House of Representatives (lower house) as a control, we then analyse politician-specific language using a Bayesian hierarchical model. We explore how the effect of the state that a senator represents changes over time, and hence how the representation of states’ interests has evolved, and how the state-identity of politicians has been subsumed by party-identity in Australia. We find that: the importance of the state-of-origin has decreased over time; and that substantial changes were associated with the world wars. Our findings have implications for how we think about the Senate as either a 'states’ house”, or a “party house”.	Rohan Alexander

We combine both perspectives to better understand the government’s behavior in bicameral bargaining.

Institutional and party-specific features, as well as empirical results, however, suggest that party goals might not be stable.To what extent the increasing importance of vote-seeking with approaching elections translates into changes in MP behaviour depends on the institutional context and the position of the party within parliament. These changes have important consequences for the outcome of the parliamentary process if bill proposals might be rejected for strategic reasons at a certain time. Therefore, this paper seeks to systematically investigate how and under which conditions the MP behaviour changes over the legislative term. By analysing full transcripts of all parliamentary speeches on bill proposals from six established democracies over more than twenty years, I can distinguish between institutional country-specific features as well as contextual features within countries. Quantitative text analysis methods such as Wordshoal and sentiment analysis allow me to track party behaviour consistently and infer changes in strategic behaviour over time.	Jan Schwalbach

An assumption in legislative studies is that parties and politicians act strategically in the legislature with an eye to their behavior’s effect on their fortunes in subsequent elections. Relatedly, some have linked the contemporary electoral struggles of mainstream parties across established democracies, and the rise of populism, to the existence or increase of policy consensus between the main opposition and the government parties. However, no one has yet tested whether legislative voting, where agreement and conflict between parliamentary groups are most tangible and visible, has a direct effect on electoral outcomes. This paper addresses the question of whether, besides government performance and party campaigns, opposition parties can influence electoral outcomes using strategic legislative voting. We leverage a broad legislative voting dataset from 15 democracies coupled with a detailed account of the opposition’s opportunity structure in each country, to establish to what extent the legislative behavior of opposition parties affects election outcomes. Thereby, the paper tests whether one of the crucial assumptions of political science, namely the connection between parliamentary behavior and electoral considerations, is valid for opposition parties.

During election campaigns, parties often announce which coalition they might or might not form after the election. Are these “coalition signals” just cheap talk for voters? If voters take these signals seriously, they should compare the actual coalition behavior of parties during the government formation process with pre-election coalition signals. Voters should then electorally punish parties that deviate from their announced coalition preferences. Employing the 1996 New Zealand election, I investigate the voters’ reaction to a party joining a coalition government that it ruled out during the election campaign. In this election, the party “New Zealand First” clearly signaled that it would not form a coalition with “National” but then did not keep this promise. My quasi-experimental research design exploits the fact that the day on which these two parties announced to form a coalition falls within the fieldwork period of the 1996 New Zealand Election Study.

Coalition parties have to come to an agreement on which policies should be implemented during the time of office and on the distribution of ministerial portfolios. While the literature on coalition governments has devoted considerable attention to predicting the allocation of ministerial portfolios, the allocation of policy payoffs has largely been neglected. We argue that payoff allocation in coalition negotiations is a two-dimensional bargaining process in which political parties simultaneously negotiate about the policy agenda and the distribution of ministerial portfolios. More specifically, we expect that there is a trade-off between policy and office benefits so that control over a ministerial portfolio decreases a party’s policy payoffs in that policy area. Our theoretical expectations are evaluated drawing on a new comparative dataset generated by a quantitative content analysis of coalition agreements. Using this dataset, we analyze policy payoff allocation in 224 multiparty cabinets in 24 Western and Eastern European countries from 1945 until 2015. Our results have important implications for our understanding of coalition formation and governance in multiparty systems.	Heike Klüver

Building on this literature, in this study I explore intra-coalition politics in presidential democracies. I argue that, similar to parliamentary systems, coalition partners in presidential democracies have an incentive (and do) keep tabs on each other when the ideological distance between them is greater. I also theorize that certain institutional features of presidential systems—particularly the fixed-term nature of the president's office and the capacity to fire ministers without fear of a government breakdown—lead to increased policy monitoring initiatives from junior partners as compared to presidential parties. By analyzing more than 20,000 information requests made between 1995 and 2014 by members of the Brazilian Congress to individual ministers, the results support my expectations of greater policy monitoring between coalition partners under more ideologically heterogeneous cabinets and greater monitoring efforts initiated by junior partners.

Nevertheless, in 2018 about one third of all governments in Europe are minority cabinets. This leads to two major questions: How successful are minority cabinets in the legislative process? And are opposition parties able to pass proposals against the cabinet? In this paper, I argue that minority cabinets are especially successful in passing their legislative agenda if they have formalized long-term agreements with non-cabinet parties which provide majority support and if they cooperate with ethno-regional parties. The empirical analysis is based on a new large dataset that combines original information on minority cabinet attributes and legislative data for about 300 governments in 27 parliamentary democracies since the 1980s. The results of the fractional logit models support the theoretical expectations. My findings provide a comparative insight into the functioning of minority governments and have important implications for research on legislative studies and party competition.	Maria Thürk

Evidence from Mexico	We study the effect of primary election divisiveness on general election outcomes in Mexico. Although an extensive literature in American politics has documented evidence that divisive primary elections hurt political parties’ electoral performance, it is unclear whether these findings generalize to other settings. Using an original dataset on legislative primaries at both the federal and the state levels, we find that divisive primaries–measured as those in which the candidate won by a narrow margin–do not affect the party’s electoral performance. However, our results show that the party leaders' interference in favor of a primary aspirant can create or exacerbate internal divisions, and even trigger party defections, significantly hurting the electoral prospects of the party’s eventual nominee. Our findings have important implications for political parties in developing countries, many of which increasingly conduct primary elections but lack the resources or institutions to guarantee that all aspirants will be treated equally.

Party Cohesion, Disagreement and Voter Perception	At times, parties’ internal disagreements become public affairs. Competing factions, leaders and MPs may even highlight internal differences to influence internal debates or to appeal to distinct constituencies. Yet, parties also face incentives to manage their disagreements to present a united face as voters think poorly of parties appearing divided. Scholars have yet to demonstrate the conditions under which real divisions within the party spill over to voter perceptions of the party’s cohesion. Major changes to their public face such as a new leader or shifts in the party’s policies likely highlight underlying divisions, whereas greater stability indicates a more cohesive party. I examine hypotheses from this perspective from a case of historically cohesive parties in the United Kingdom. I develop indicators of internal disagreement over policy preferences issue priorities derived from their largest decision-making body, the party conference, to predict voters’ perceptions of party unity. The results highlight the importance of intra-party politics and the role of party leaders in maintaining an internal coalition while helping to explain conflicting evidence on whether voters perceive parties’ policy change.

Evidence from a List Experiment in Turkey	How does the form of interparty contact shape attitudinal variation in supporting election violence in diverse constituencies? To answer the afore-stated, this paper argues that interparty contact help reduce prejudice among the electorate living in the same constituencies and thereby it reduces support for election violence against out-party members. Especially, heterogenous constituencies are the most conducive ones to have frequent and positive interparty contact. However, the puzzling scenario is about why we would observe greater support for election violence in constituencies where higher levels of contact are likely. Drawing on the heterogenous electoral districts in Istanbul, I run an online list experiment in order to test whether voters living in competitive constituencies are more supportive of electoral violence. The results show that voters in diverse districts are more likely to support electoral violence unless they are in face-to-face direct contact with the out-party individuals. These results also point to the issue of electoral violence prevention in diverse communities where interventions should be made at the grass-roots level.	Bugra Güngör

Presidents influence and the Allocation of Central Government Grants in Taiwan	Scholarship on distributive politics primarily focuses on the role of the legislature, with particular attention to seniority, committee and majority parties in Congress. A growing research agenda is shifting towards more a critical consideration of the presidency, as a tool of the distribution of expenditures, in a particularistic fashion. Rather than, controlled by electorally motivated legislators, distributive politics is driven by presidents who impel the executive branch to allocate fiscal resources to electorally important co-partisan strongholds. To address this question, I test this argument in Taiwan with an original dataset regarding the distribution of central government grants cross 23 municipalities from 2001-2017. The findings suggest that a minister in the executive government with more experience as a municipal official is more likely to distribute, comparatively, more fiscal expenditures to its previously related municipalities, particularly those municipalities which are currently presented by presidential co-partisan mayors and legislators. By granting more fiscal expenditures to these municipalities, the president attempts to gain more leverage in Congress and, thus, reinforce their electoral competitiveness.	Yen-Chieh Liao

It is widely accepted that most legislators anticipate an electoral benefit for successfully steering pork to their constituents, but the literature has produced inconsistent evidence demonstrating an electoral advantage for pork and has found largely conditional effects for the role of congressional parties and the executive branch. Recent work by Jon Rogowski, Sanford Gordon, and others has probed the historical development of distributive politics in the U.S. This paper advances our understanding of distributive and partisan politics, as well as congressional development more generally, by looking to an earlier era of congressional history. Using original data on the construction of public buildings I describe the unfolding of a precursor to modern-style pork-barrel politics. Moreover, analysis of the factors determining how party and committee leaders distributed federal benefits among the increasingly-careerist legislators of the time reveals the nature of partisan and electoral considerations in even the pre-modern Congress.

A territorial cleavage rather than a functional one presumably determines the logic of cooperation in the international realm. Yet, more than fifty transnational political groups have formed worldwide within eleven international parliaments while remaining largely overlooked by the scholarship. In a first attempt to analyze the phenomenon systematically, this paper explores the formation of transnational political groups in a comparative perspective. By drawing on the party and institutionalism literatures, a theory is developed to illuminate the conditions under which transnational political groups form. The theoretical expectations are tested empirically with a new original dataset covering more than sixty international parliaments since their creation to present. The results from a logistic regression analysis lend support to the theory. As nation states are increasingly confronted with political challenges that require supranational decision-making, it becomes highly important to understand how and why international parliaments organize.

An extensive literature on accountability and clarity of responsibility suggests that divided governments should be more corrupt than unified ones. This literature argues divided governments blur lines of responsibility and make it harder for voters to hold the incumbent accountable for its past corrupt performance. However, elections are imperfect instruments of accountability. Furthermore, a significant number of studies show that divided governments ensure the system of separation of powers in presidential systems and create effective checks-and-balances mechanisms which should help to prevent abuses of authority, including corruption. To bring clarity to this issue, I combine a regression-discontinuity and a state fixed-effects regression analyses to estimate the effect of partisan control of government in American States on corruption. The results suggest that divided governments do not increase corruption compared to united ones, other things equal.	Elisabeth de Vega Alavedra

However, unlike the electoral success of new parties, the entry of new parties, in particular in the period after the first few democratic elections, is under-researched. This paper examines how the chances of electoral success affects elites' decisions to form new political parties and the appeals of these parties. It develops and tests the argument that new parties are more likely to emerge under high levels of corruption and low economic growth that cause voter disaffection with established parties. To maximise their electoral appeals, new parties that respond to this voter disaffection adopt centrist positions on the left-right dimension - with the exception of splinter parties that are constrained by the previous policy commitments of their elites. The findings from 10 countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the period between 2000 and 2018 support these arguments. No support was found to the hypotheses about two other representational strategies of new parties: addressing unoccupied voter niches on the left-right dimension or individual policy issues ignored by existing parties.

Legislators' goals and party switching strategies in Western Europe	Party switching occurs when members of parliament change their party affiliation. This behaviour can pose a severe threat to party unity and endanger accountability and representation. While the literature on the topic has growth in recent years, to date, researchers have rarely explored the different patterns that lead politicians to change party individually or collectively. Since the logic of these two de-affiliation strategies is different, I argue that they might also be explained by differing factors. In particular, I suppose that legislators switch party in group or alone to reach different sets of goals. To test my hypotheses, I rely on an original database of all inter-party movements occurred in fourteen Western European countries from 1945 to 2015. The results of my statistical analysis show that ideological concerns are at the origin of group switching, while solo-defectors are usually instrumentally-motivated and seek re-election and/or a career advancement.

This paper studies the relationship between candidate change and party policy change. The causality can run in both ways. On the one hand, candidate change reflects general personnel change among parties and policy ideas can change following the change of people. On the other hand, policy changes can alienate existing candidates and/or draw in new people. Our analysis finds that candidate and policy change are linked when controlling for factors like party size, change in support etc. For candidate change, we rely on our original dataset “Electoral Candidates in Central and Eastern Europe” covering 200,000 candidates from 60 elections in nine democracies since 1990. For measuring policy change, we use MARPOR and CHES – two authoritative datasets with time-series data on party policies. Instead of employing ready-made aggregate indices (Left-Right / Gal-Tan), we develop new measures accounting for changes in specific policies; this is necessary as previous studies have cautioned against using the Left-Right scale in the region.

On the one hand, candidate change reflects general personnel change among parties and policy ideas can change following the change of people. On the other hand, policy changes can alienate existing candidates and/or draw in new people. Our analysis finds that candidate and policy change are linked when controlling for factors like party size, change in support etc. For candidate change, we rely on our original dataset “Electoral Candidates in Central and Eastern Europe” covering 200,000 candidates from 60 elections in nine democracies since 1990. For measuring policy change, we use MARPOR and CHES – two authoritative datasets with time-series data on party policies. Instead of employing ready-made aggregate indices (Left-Right / Gal-Tan), we develop new measures accounting for changes in specific policies; this is necessary as previous studies have cautioned against using the Left-Right scale in the region.

This paper narrows the gap between youth political participation and party membership by analysing a newly conducted, broad-based survey of youth party members in Germany (2017-2018). A major research gap exists in both the research area of political parties as well as the area of political participation. The individual level survey data (n > 1200) collected for this study allow an assessment of the socio-economic background of youth party members, their motivation, their political and career ambitions, their position within their youth organisation, and their relationship to their parent party. From this, conclusions about the purpose of youth party organisations are drawn, as to whether they primarily serve as a representation tool for the interests of young citizens or whether they primarily function as a recruitment pool for prospective leaders in the parent party. Furthermore, an aggregate level comparison of youth parties and the parent parties regarding their composition and political positions helps us analysing which youth parties constitute a political identity of their own and which are simply a younger replication of their parent parties.

A common assumption in this literature is that legacies follow a monotone pattern, with their impact either remaining constant or decaying over time. We propose an alternative, non-linear trajectory, whereby exogenous shocks can re-activate the signalling capacity of the past. We assess this theory of ‘interrupted continuities’ focusing on the post-crisis rise of the radical right in Greece. Employing a within-prefecture, cross-community design, we use original data to reveal the historical aspect of the Golden Dawn (GD) vote. We find a strong correlation between civi-war-driven anti-Communism and GD support. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, anti-communism a) stems from the civil-war experience and does not precede it; and b) does not predict the GD vote before the crisis. Narratives born out of traumatic experiences endure via local memory, becoming politically relevant when the opportunity structure arises. Apart from enhancing our understanding about the roots of radical right support, the findings qualify existing accounts of how the past feeds into people’s political predispositions.	Elli Palaiologou

How Partisanship and Ethnicity Refract National Attachment in the United States and England	We investigate how the content of American and British national identity varies according to the group lens of the beholder – particularly ethnicity and ideology. While much work has examined criteria for distinguishing those high or low in nationalism, ‘true’ Americans from others, or the ‘ethnic-civic’ dimension of national identity, we know far less about the affective aspect of nationalism (how the symbolic composition of national affections varies by ethnicity, partisanship, and other criteria). We hypothesize that whites and non-whites, progressives and conservatives, all possess national identities but are attracted to different myth-symbol complexes. We examine how respondents across three samples (2018 CCES, MTurk, and BBC/YouGov) rated how multiple factors (such as the countryside, sports, diversity, history, and parks) connect to their perceptions of American and English identity. We test whether such responses change depending on the ‘optical’ lens of the beholder (Kaufmann 2008), as national identity, territory and people are the ‘light’ that is refracted through the interpretive ‘lens’ of ideology and interests. This has implications for better understanding contemporary nationalism and for discerning a ‘hidden’ ethnic white majority.	David Leal, Eric Kaufmann

Religion, Language, Race and Ethnic Voting	Why do some ethnic groups vote along ethnic lines while others do not? This paper looks at whether the objective characteristics of ethnicity – in terms of language, religion and race – affect ethnic voting. I address three sets of questions: (1) are ethnic groups that are objectively different from other groups of their country more likely to vote ethnically? (2) is ethnic voting higher among groups that are linguistically, religiously and racially homogeneous? (3) do some ethnic markers, such as religion, induce more ethnic voting than others? Using a dataset covering 146 ethnic groups and 50 democracies worldwide, I find that within-group homogeneity increases ethnic voting. On balance, however, there is little evidence that between-group heterogeneity or the identity of the ethnic dimension affect ethnic voting. These results suggest that a group’s internal characteristics and the cohesiveness of its members play a key role in explaining its voting behavior.	Christian Houle

Most recent result, however, undermine the story of stability.

Political preferences and behavior of production and service workers in post-industrial societies	Recent research has extensively documented the partisan realignment of industrial production workers and socio-cultural professionals in Europe. Yet, we know substantially less about the political behavior and attitudes of low-skilled service workers. This paper analyzes whether service workers will join the ranks of industrial production workers (in political terms) or whether they will instead display distinct political preferences, hence further undermining the potential of a working-class coalition. A comparison of production and service workers based on European Social Survey data indicates that, in spite of strong differences in their socio-demographic composition, these two classes constitute a homogeneous electoral constituency. These two groups display similar preferences on cultural and economic issues, as well as similar patterns of electoral behavior. In this paper, I also analyze whether the politicization of these issues by political parties moderates the differences in preferences between these two classes across political contexts. The hierarchical models incorporating information on the electoral supply indicate that production and service workers remain a viable and homogenous electoral coalition even in countries where economic and cultural issues are highly politicized.

We argue that voters who live in districts which are culturally more distinct and exclusive are more likely to vote for radical right parties. Cultural remoteness strengthens feelings of local identity and the need to isolate oneself from global developments. We approximate cultural remoteness by relying on linguistic micro-data from a unique dialectic survey conducted in the 19th century in 45,000 German schools. Using voting results on the district level we then predict voting for the Alternative für Deutschland and the Nazi party in 7 elections.

We approach cultural cleavage as two distinctive cultural divides: moral traditionalism-progressivism dimension that refers to religiously inspired attitudes to matters of procreation, family and gender roles; and secular authoritarianism-libertarianism dimension that captures predominantly secular attitudes towards matters of immigration, law, and order. Focusing on country-level differences in polarization about those two cultural divides, we seek to explain them from the perspective of secularization. We hypothesize, that a decline in religion sparks a decline in polarization about moral traditionalism between the religious and the secular; and that it sparks the ascendancy of an all-out secular polarization about authoritarianism between the more and the less educated. We use data from the four waves of the EVS (1980-2008) to test, by means of regression analysis, whether indeed cultural polarization is affected by processes of secularization.	Anna Kulkova

This paper explores why voters might vote for political candidates who espouse extreme ideologies the voters themselves do not support, or who offend ethnic groups to whom the voters belong, or display personal behaviors the voters do not approve. We develop a model in which voters may have a preference for candidates who are outsiders to the political establishment, and are willing to tolerate candidate characteristics they dislike provided that these characteristics increase the probability that the candidate is an outsider. We find that lower levels of trust towards traditional politics may favor the emergence of outsider candidates and the use of extreme behaviour or political platforms by candidates regardless of their actual preferences. We successfully test the inference mechanism on which the model is built using survey data from several European countries.	Jerome Gonnot

Drawing from the latest round of the European Social Survey and Eurobarometer surveys, multilevel models show strong and positive association between lower levels of subjective status and support for right- and left-wing radicalism in thirteen European countries. The difference between the two forms of radicalism lies in the referential point to which individuals compare themselves to. While the far-right supporters’ status anxiety is driven through comparison with emerging ethnic groups, far-left supporters’ status anxiety develops through comparison with perceptions of their parents’ generations where opportunities were greater. Traditional attitudes magnify the effects of social decline on radical support: it is reinforced by anti-immigrant support for the far right and by pro-equality measure for the far left. This study shows the relevance of including relative social decline as a reconciling economic and cultural factor between far-right and far-left.	Diane Bolet

Undecided voters at the extremes of the left-right dimension and their influence on mainstream party responsiveness	Increasing electoral support for challenger parties has altered mainstream parties’ strategic considerations in most West European party systems. However, previous work that has been concerned with party responsiveness toward public opinion has predominantly focused on left-right shifts of the median voter or movements of parties’ supporters (Adams 2012). In this paper, I advance this body of research by focusing on mainstream parties’ responsiveness toward positional movements of their fringe voters, i.e. those voters that are positioned toward the extreme end of the left-right dimension and that waver between a centrist mainstream party and a more radical challenger party. I argue that the rise of challenger parties forces mainstream parties to target this so far under-researched voter group by shifting away from the centre of the left-right dimension. I test this claim empirically by employing voters’ left-right positions in combination with parties’ like-dislike scores (national election studies) and party position data (MARPOR/CMP) from 13 West European countries since 1985. Moreover, I investigate when mainstream parties respond to position shifts of their fringe voters rather than movements of the median voter.	Werner Krause

Conventional spatial models predict that (1) the swing voters, rather than the core voters of the left will (2) convert to a center-right party, rather than a nationalist party. In this paper, I argue that this pattern arises when the left emphasizes its cultural platform at the expense of its economic platform. To illustrate this point, I build a model where parties can choose which issues they will claim ownership on. If their strategies alienate sufficiently many voters, the nationalist party chooses to enter the election. The model predicts that the nationalist party is most likely to enter the election when the left focuses on cultural dimension and the right focuses on economic dimension. This results in cultural conservative and economic moderate left voters converting to the center-right party, while cultural conservative and economic left voters convert to the nationalist party. The result shows that nationalist parties are best thwarted when the left remains an economic left.	Jaerin Kim

Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany	p	85256	430	Party Membership, Pre-Parliamentary Socialization and Party Cohesion	Party membership seems to lose relevance in most established democracies. Yet, what kind of behavior does long-term party membership imply? In this paper, I argue that party membership is crucial to internalizing group norms. Using data on the party membership background of ca. 2,000 MPs of the German Bundestag from 1953 to 2013, I show that MPs that have joined their party at a younger age and that have been a member for a longer time before their candidacy, are less likely to disagree with the majority of their party on free votes. Examining free votes on which discipline is lifted, alternative sources generating unity are controlled for by design. Results are in line with expectations generated from social identity theory and underscore the importance of party membership for party coherence. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings' implications in light of recent developments in parties' candidate recruitment.	Jochen Rehmert

The determinants of attitudes towards activation policies and perceived levels of deservingness.	Since the 1980ies European welfare states use a set of labor market policy instruments called activation or welfare-to-work measures about which we know very little. At the same time there is general evidence that attitudes on generosity vary according to possible different claimant groups, referred to as “deservingness”. ESS 8 provides data on public support for cutting benefits (by different levels) in case that recipients should turn down a job offer, which belongs to the type of activation policies using negative incentive reinforcement or so-called ‘demanding’ activation policies. Furthermore ESS 8, via a survey experiment, allows for an analysis of related attitudes according to four different groups of recipients (i.e. young, old, single parents, other unemployed). These data for the first time offer the possibility to disentangle attitudes towards demanding activation policies and differences in preferences on the background of different levels of “deservingness”, attributed to different groups. Using multilevel analysis we demonstrate how attitudes towards activation policies and also perceptions of deservingness vary systematically according to material self-interest, ideological preferences, and national legacies.

Welfare states have transformed their core policies due to low economic growth. One recent approach is SI, which aims at shifting the economy from the traditional welfare state to the high-productivity economy via long-term and inclusive human capital formation. SI is a popular welfare approach in many developed countries with governments promoting SI and evidence of public support for such policies. However, other governments do not utilise SI, presumably because it is unpopular among voters. Focusing on Japan, where SI is less emphasised, we hypothesise that voters don't favour SI because (1) they do not know that SI reduces economic inequality; (2) they do not know SI strengthens the knowledge-based sector; (3) they cannot find a political party that would promote SI; or (4) they avoid spending their tax on investment without knowing its clear effects on economic growth. To find out which is true, we conduct survey experiments that randomly give respondents different information about SI. Our results elucidate what kinds of SI policies could be achieved without damaging electoral fortunes.	Mark Brazzill, Yuki Yanai

However, public opinion on climate change worldwide is an important component of how climate change can be tackled by states. One communication strategy is to securitize climate change and highlight how climate change threatens humanity, states, or individuals. However, under what conditions publics perceive threat from climate change is a relatively understudied area of securitization research. We address this question by conducting a comparative analysis of public attitudes towards climate security using data from Pew Research Center Spring 2015 Global Attitudes Survey. The countries in the study have diverse performance in addressing climate change, ranging from European Union members with pledges to mitigate climate change to countries with high levels of climate scepticism like the United States. This study will make a contribution to the existing literature by shedding light on what makes the public to consider an issue as a ‘threat’ rather than a ‘concern,’ thereby enabling securitizing moves to receive consent and moral support from the public.

Insights from Choice Experiments	What are citizens’ preferences towards public policies for rapid decarbonization? And to what extent do a) the concrete design features of a policy, and b) 'social influences' like social norms and cues by opinion leaders affect citizens’ level of policy support? Based on a representative sample of Americans (n = 1,520), we investigate public preferences with respect to two areas that can contribute to rapid decarbonization: the phase-out of fossil fuel cars, and the employment of carbon capture and storage technologies. Using discrete choice experiments, we elicit Americans’ preferences on various policy scenarios to get insights on the social acceptability of different pathways to decarbonization. Our approach allows to disentangle the importance citizens attach to various policy design features (e.g., policy instrument, timing, and costs), and demonstrates the role of social influences in preference formation. The study contributes to ongoing research in psychology and political science on the impact of social norms and elite cues on individual attitudes and behavior. Moreover, it yields concrete implications for policymakers concerned with the question of how to achieve the decarbonization of our economies.	Silvia Pianta

By conducting this experiment in three very different health systems and asking about the size of the preferred fee, we are able to examine variation in the strength of norms of universality and welfare state conditionality.

The vast research on immigration in recent years has documented a number of important empirical regularities with respect to the determinants of natives' views on immigration. However, this research has overwhelming focused on attitudes toward immigration in general, without distinguishing between natives' preferences with respect to foreigners already in the country (immigration 'stock') versus those expected to enter the country in the future (immigration 'flows'). This paper studies whether and how citizens' attitudes differ with respect to the two groups of immigrants. We begin by theorizing about the implications of each group on individual preferences toward immigration. We then test those predictions by replicating three widely-cited experiments on immigration attitudes, but design them such that participants are asked about either immigration stocks or flows. We report the experimental results from four advanced economies (US, Germany, Italy and Spain). Our preliminary analysis shows that attitudes toward the two groups of immigrants differ substantially and in a theoretically predictable manner. Based on these results, we offer guidance as to how future research should study public opinion on immigration stocks and flows.	Omer Solodoch

Evidence From the United Kingdom	This paper tests the theory that welfare chauvinism explains opposition to immigration, using two experiments embedded in a nationally representative household panel survey. We suggest that economic self-interest has been too narrowly conceptualised as labour market competition, and that instead we should consider the role of competition over public services – schooling, healthcare and housing. In a conjoint experiment, we vary hypothetical migrant characteristics on these dimensions, and ask respondents to choose who they would grant the right to remain. We consider heterogeneous treatment effects using geocoded data on the performance of relevant public services in the respondent’s local area. In a vignette experiment, we vary the location of the hypothetical immigrant, to test whether local residents (who would be in direct competition for local public services) are treated less favourably than migrants who live elsewhere. We advance on previous work by focusing on the decision to grant the right to remain, rather than enter the country.	Nicole Martin

Addressing this question with cross-sectional survey data is difficult because the correlation between individuals’ economic standing and their views on immigration can be due to unobservable characteristics that affect both. To deal with this empirical challenge, this paper uses panel survey data from the Netherlands (LISS) and Germany (GLES) that trace the labour market experiences and the political attitudes of citizens over several years. We argue that an individual’s baseline view on immigration is best predicted by relatively immutable cultural predispositions, while personal experiences of economic hardship explain changes in anti-immigrant attitudes over time. We also argue that party identification (PID) is the filter through which citizens make sense of the political world and we therefore expect it to be a key variable that conditions how actual and perceived economic hardship affects attitudes towards immigrants.

Support for Brexit and associated negative feelings about immigration were highest in places with the lowest proportions of immigrants. This finding represents something of a puzzle, as it suggests that attitudes towards immigration may not be shaped by individuals’ actual lived experiences of immigration. What, then, are they shaped by? In this article, we approach the issue from a slightly different perspective from previous studies and examine the conditions under which the formation of ethnic in-group loyalty (among white British/English) leads to negative feelings towards ethnic outgroups (immigrants and non-white British/English). In doing so, we pay particular attention to within-group economic inequality at the local level. We hypothesise that when ethnic in-groups are economically homogenous at the local level, in-group solidarity and out-group hostility are greater than when ethnic groups are economically heterogeneous and thus differentiated on cross-cutting dimensions.

We hypothesise that when ethnic in-groups are economically homogenous at the local level, in-group solidarity and out-group hostility are greater than when ethnic groups are economically heterogeneous and thus differentiated on cross-cutting dimensions. We test the hypothesis through quantitative analysis of data from the British Election Study between 2014 and 2016.	Matthew Polacko

Mannheim Centre for European Social Research - University of Mannheim, Germany	p	86328	935	The Effect of Local Context on Citizens’ Attitudes toward Immigration Policy	With the massive influx of migrants, the ethnic and religious composition of European societies is changing rapidly. Alongside these developments, most European countries experienced an increasing demand for more restrictive immigration policies in recent years. Existing work mostly focuses on the association between the two phenomena on a national level. Research looking into the effects of immigration and socio-demographic composition on immigration policy preferences on a local level remains limited. I will contribute to the ongoing debate by analyzing the effect of local contexts on individual immigration policy preferences in Germany, recently struck by populist challenges. I will use fine-grained and uniquely suited data from the German city of Mannheim combining survey data with detailed information on the ethnic composition of local contexts as well as the locations of refugee reception centres and mosques. The survey contains information on the respondents’ exact geo-location as well as their preferences regarding immigration policy. In order to estimate the causal effects, I will match respondents based on both individual characteristics and their local context only allowing for variation in specific contextual conditions.

However, the reasons for this are not well understood. This study sets out to fill this gap by investigating why attitudes towards immigration systematically differ between older and younger generations of Europeans. Applying hierarchical age-period-cohort models using 8 rounds of European Social Survey data (2002-2016) in 25 European countries, we aim to adjudicate between three possible explanations. The value-based explanation portrays the effect of age-cohort as being due to a gradual shift in values such as a rise in post-materialism and multiculturalism. The behavioral explanation argues that whereby cohorts are differently exposed to immigration during their youth, which offers varying levels of contact with foreigners during their formative years. Finally, the compositional explanation maintains the effect is due to differences in the characteristics of the younger cohorts compared to the older cohorts such as a larger proportion of first and second-generation immigrants or the presence of individuals with a lower socio-economic background.

How short-term exposure to refugees influences attitudes and voting behavior in Hungary	How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting. We code exposure to refugees at the municipality level using state media, an independent online news site, and data from journalists on social media. Towns through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect, which we estimate between 1.7 and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition Jobbik party gained votes in these towns, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in the subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are punished by voters skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition within the right, as individuals in exposed towns are more fearful of immigrants and support more restrictive policies, though only if they identify with right-wing parties.

Immigration touches upon emotionally charged questions of identity and has the potential to transform the political landscape. Its increased salience not only altered the way many Europeans think about immigration, but also affected their electoral behavior as evidenced by recent electoral successes of populist radical right-wing parties (PRRP) in many European countries. Using longitudinal ESS data, we show that in the wake of the refugee crisis anti-immigrant sentiments translate more often into the election of PRRP. Put differently, the refugee crisis mobilized previously dormant attitudes and channeled them into electoral politics. This general effect is moderated by different individual- and country-level factors. At the individual level, feelings of distrust and a lack of political efficacy strengthen the effect of anti-immigrant sentiments on the PRPP vote. At the country-level, the programmatic offers by established parties influence support for PRRP. While support for PRRP is generally stronger among immigration sceptics, it is particularly pronounced in countries where established parties opened a representation gap by converging on moderately pro-immigration positions.

This raises the following questions: Are the benefits of restrictive immigrant policies political rather than economic, and do incumbent governments receive an electoral edge by implementing such policies? In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment in Germany, where, following a deterministic assignment rule, certain regions were exempted from a reform that liberalized labor market access for refugees. Using difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity designs, we find that the incumbent vote share sharply increases in regions with restrictive labor market access. Exploring different mechanisms, our results suggest that this effect is primarily driven by differential candidate entry: In regions with restrictive labor market access, fewer conservative and populist candidates are running for office. Our results suggest that not only do immigration inflows have direct electoral repercussions, but immigrant policies do also.	Moritz Marbach

Since the 2000s, challenger parties have witnessed a rise in their popularity, while mainstream ones seem to be experiencing a phase of decline or stagnation. Nonethelss, regardless of the general trend, the geography of this success is not as unidirectional. When we look past the national level regions differ extensively. My research focus is on the role played by loss of economic status on support for challenger parties. In particular, I look at the interaction between the different levels (national, regional and individual) at which resentment and uncertainty can trigger the success of challenger parties. I argue that economic malaise opens a window of opportunity which challenger parties can exploit to mobilise voters through different strategies, not necessarely related to economic issues. To answer my research question I employ multilevel modeling of individual data from the European Election Study, regional-level from Eurostat and country-level from Eurostat and the Comparative Political Dataset. With a comparative study I investigate how opportunities for challenger parties are engendered.	Francesco Colombo

A cross-country comparison of the dynamics of vote margins	A well-known phenomenon in US presidential election campaigns is that the electoral margin tightens over the course of the campaign. In that sense, election campaigns may make alternative futures imaginable and tangible. However, can this pattern be found elsewhere, outside the US? Relying on a comparable conceptualization of competitiveness, this study evaluates the dynamics of vote margins in comparative perspective using the “Dataset on Polls and the Timeline of Elections” (Jennings & Wlezien, 2018). The results show that vote margins tend to narrow across a wide range of different institutional settings. Yet, the analyses also uncover some heterogeneity in the trends across countries as well as deviant cases. Overall, the results contribute to the ongoing debates about the functions of election campaigns in modern democracies.	Julia Partheymueller

Specifically, we argue that the strength of the relationship between rural deprivation and the propensity of voting radical right is moderated by local government efficiency—that is, the capability of local administrations to convert resources (e.g., money, staff) into specific outputs (e.g., public transport, schooling, elderly care). This proposition is tested using information on local voting success of the Alternative für Deutschland in the German federal election 2017, local demographic data, and an indicator on local government efficiency derived from cost efficiency models that link resource use and relevant outputs of German municipalities. Results from regression models (with controls and state fixed effects) suggest that local government efficiency attenuates the relationship between rural deprivation and populist radical right support. Areas undergoing socio-demographic and structural-economic decline would benefit from efficient local administrations as they mitigate political deprivation as motivating factor of radical right support.

Illuminated by perceptions of violent behavior perpetrated by ethnic minorities, emerging politicians have sought to capitalise on a simmering disquiet among sections of the anglo-celt majority. This paper draws from the public statements of both Dutton and Anning to determine if they can be codified within the existing minimalist (Mudde & Kalwasser, 2013a) and exclusionary (Betz, 2004; Ceuppens, 2006; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2013b) definitions of populism. It then revisits the ‘mainstreaming’ scholarship that was a consequence of Pauline Hanson’s first term of office (Moffitt & Snow, 2012; Mondon, 2013; Wear, 2008) to consider how it might be applied since the 2016 Australian Federal Election.

The Electoral Consequences of Populist Participation in Goverment	The paper examines whether including populist political parties in government coalitions has an impact on their future electoral prospects. According to the theory on party strategy developed by Meguid (2008), this is an accommodating strategy and we expect they will decrease their vote shares after their participation in the executive. Contrary to that, it could be argued that reaching the government makes the issues they own more salient and, above all, leads voters to perceive them as more legitimate. In order to address this question, we take the Chapel Hill surveys to identify populist political parties and analyse the cases of coalition governments that formed in Europe when non-populist parties needed to decide whether to ostracise populists or incorporate them into the government. The effect is conditioned by the electoral system of a country and the level of ideological polarization of the party system. The findings suggest that non-populist parties hinder the rise of populism by including them in coalitions, which has ultimately important consequences for the future of representative democracy in Europe.

Given the importance attributed to immigration in shaping political preferences at several recent elections, it is crucial to understand the factors affecting citizens' opinions in this domain. However current individual explanations of immigration attitudes, largely focused on out-group attitudes or perceived sociotropic threat, tend to ignore people's beliefs about the state's ability to effectively manage migratory inflows, turning a potential threat into an opportunity. We theorize that an important factor affecting individuals' attitudes toward immigration is their trust in state institutions. We derive observable implications of our theory by looking at corruption, as a proxy for state functioning, and the overall effectiveness of state institutions. We test our expectations using comparative cross-sectional data from the Eurobarometer and the European Social Survey. Preliminary findings show that higher degrees of corruption in a country, as well as higher perceived corruption by individual respondents, are associated with their tendency to perceive immigration as a problem rather than an opportunity.

Studying the drivers of public opinion about immigration facilitates understanding developments like Brexit or recent national elections. Research on public opinion points to the influence of party cues on public preferences (e.g. Zaller, 1992). At the same time, an education cleavage increasingly separates citizens with libertarian values from those holding authoritarian values (Stubager, 2009). What is less studied is how cross-pressured citizens, i.e. citizens receiving party cues that are incongruent with values arising from their education, form attitudes toward immigration. This study explores this question, relying on statistical methods for time-series cross-sectional data. References Kriesi H, Grande E, Lachat R, et al.

In this paper we conduct a systematic review of the causal inference literature on this question. We collect more than 130 estimates from 17 studies to calculate a meta-estimate of the relationship. Next we study the correlation between reported estimates and their precision to examine the degree of reporting bias in the literature.

Many European countries have implemented integration programs to improve the social integration of newly arrived immigrants. To what extent these programs are successful in achieving this goal is hard to evaluate because they tend to be implemented in a manner that makes it diﬃcult to identify a comparison group. Moreover, evaluations tend to be restricted to studying labour market outcomes, which provides an incomplete picture of social integration. We employ rich administrative data to study the long-term eﬀect of the Norwegian Introductory Program on political participation and naturalization. We exploit that the program was implemented so that immigrants arriving after September 1, 2003 had a right to participate in the program, while those arriving before did not. Using various techniques to control for diﬀerences between late and early arrivals, we study effects on labour market integration, naturalization, and voter turnout.	Henning Finseraas

The rise and practice of religious voting in Victorian Britain are significant. The class cleavage has been shown to be an important determinant of voter behaviour, and yet, its emergence is rooted in this religious conflict. More so, to some extent, religious polarisation continues to define voting behaviour today. However, we know little of what the patterns of Victorian religious voting looked like. The lack of empirical evidence is due to the cost and difficulty in collecting the relevant individual and aggregate data. This paper fills the gap by using data from the 1851 religious census, poll books, and church membership documents. The data shows that a religious cleavage emerged in the 19thcentury, and confirms the divide between Anglicans and Nonconformists. However, I challenge the notion that this began to dissipate at the end of the century. This identifies the strength of religious polarisation and questions the primacy of other cleavages in determining political identity in modern Britain.	Samuel Mellish

Missing is a study that investigates the effect of candidate’s religiosity on how voters perceive her, regardless of her party affiliation. Also, the effect of candidate policy positions on candidate evaluation and vote choice are understudied. In this study, we analyze the results from a conjoint survey experiment in Turkey. Each respondent was shown a video of a hypothetical legislative candidate’s speech. 6 different characteristics of the candidate (religiosity, age, political experience, education and 2 policy positions) are manipulated across the respondents. The outcomes we measure are voters’ evaluation of the hypothetical candidate in the video. The results of the conjoint analysis indicate that there is an interaction between the voters’ religiosity and the candidate’s religiosity even when party ID is of the candidate is not clear. Furthermore, policy positions matter regardless of the candidate’s or the respondent’s religiosity.	Yusuf Magiya

In this paper we use a unique dataset on Poland to provide causal estimates of religious attendance on voters’ participation in the local elections. We work with roughly 2,500 observations at the municipal level and our data span the period 1998-2008. To analyze the impact of religiosity on political participation, we follow two strategies. First, we use the difference-in-differences strategy. Second, we adopt an instrumental variables approach. For that purpose we use novel instruments measuring the share of sacral monuments and the share of streets with the names associated with the Church. Our results robustly show that in municipalities with greater religious attendance (lower pace of secularization) the voters’ turnout during the election at the local level has been larger.

Identities, causal antecedents and support for secession	The Linz-Moreno question has become the most popular measure to assess how national/regional identities affect support for secession in stateless nations. The empirical evidence gathered until today clearly shows that the more regional (in contrast to national) an individual feels, the higher the likelihood of supporting the region’s independence. In parallel, an individual’s origin, the knowledge of the regional language have also been shown to determine his/her support for secession. In this research note, we combine these two narratives and argue that the literature has hitherto missed a proper conceptualisation of how the regional/national identity is related to the other correlates of support for secession. Using data from Catalonia, the Basque Country, Scotland and Quebec, and a Causal Mediation Analysis, our results show that the origin and the knowledge of the regional language are strong antecedents of the national/regional identity, while the direct impact of these variables trough identity is rather small.

The departing hypothesis is that the territorial distribution of population affects in a pervasive manner how voters align along ethnic lines in polarized contexts. Relying on observational data from elections and census for more than 5.000 administrative sections into which Catalonia is divided for the last electoral cycle, the research combines geographical regression methods with ecological inference techniques. Theoretically, the research combines an approach based on the notion of ethnic boundaries with threat and contact effects from contextual approaches, exploring whether this combination results in significant intra-group variations depending on the environment where individuals live.

Yet, conventional strategies are common in both democratic and autocratic systems. Under what conditions do subnational groups employ conventional politics? Our argument is that groups playing by the rules signal legitimacy and reliability, thereby making diplomatic appeals for support to the international community more credible. Sovereignty referendums by groups demanding autonomy or independence address a salient identity issue and, as a focal point, allow for domestic and international mobilization in a system where contestation is challenging. Employing survival analysis techniques, we investigate the relevance of contestants’ international diplomacy for subnational sovereignty referendums on a global scale since 1990. We assess the internal validity of the proposed mechanism based on expert interviews for the 2017 independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan. Our findings demonstrate that referendums are indeed associated with greater international involvement, suggesting that transnational diplomacy is critical for the choice of conventional strategies in authoritarian regimes.

The parties face a trade-off between maintaining party unity and gaining votes by allowing regional candidates to defect from the party line. We analyze this trade-off using co-sponsorship networks from 1986-2016. We propose a new measure for regional cooperation and use spatial regression models to analyse the decision-making structure. We show that, close to elections, government parties allow more regional initiatives from districts where they did poorly in the last election.

A Latent-Variable Measurement Approach to Political Experience	One of the central concepts in the study of leadership, particularly in international relations, is that of individual experience. More experienced leaders handle crises more competently; they are less likely to be tested by adversaries. There is a significant amount of conceptual stretching and proxy-ing for experience and related concepts of age, competence and tenure. We are motivated by two main aims. First, we explain the concept of experience so it is empirically useful. Because experience in politics is a multifaceted concept, we account for duration of experience in politics, the quality of experience, and its breadth. Second, drawing on a novel data set of 2,000 leaders from 1950 to 2017 and using a Bayesian latent variable model, we develop a new measurement tool of political experience. We then apply a new measure to explain an apparent rise of inexperienced leaders in democracies. We find that while democracies select more experienced leaders, over time the difference with non-democracies has declined. We also replicate several conflict studies that relied on age or tenure as proxies for experience with our measure instead.	Alexander Baturo

These changes occur when there is divergence between the electorate and a party’s stated preferences.

Using text analysis, we measure changes in manifestos as the variety and salience of issues addressed and positioning on those issues. Using manifestos from 1965-2013 in Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, we incorporate data from O’Brien (2015) on party leadership changes and quantitatively trace major shifts on issues. We expect type- mainstream/niche- status- Government/Opposition- and intra-party institutional structures play a role in moderating the effect of leadership shifts on manifesto changes.

We have some evidence that, on an aggregate level, voters value equal descriptive representation of men and women in parliaments. Meanwhile, research has shown that left-leaning parties are much more likely than right-leaning parties to nominate female candidates. Using a single vignette survey experiment in five European countries, I show that voters prefer equal descriptive representation of men and women in political parties. However, this effect is strongly mediated by ideology: left-leaning voters discount parties that are dominated by men while right-leaning voters do not exhibit strong preferences for gender representation. Additionally, having a female lead candidate can even out low female descriptive representation. These findings have important implications for research on women’s representation: they help to explain the different share of female candidates between left- and right-leaning parties and enhance our understanding of the role of party leadership for the perception of women’s representation among the public.

Inclusion, Exclusion, and Political Ambition	As political institutions become more inclusive, a robust literature has examined how the presence of women representatives affects the political engagement and ambition of American women. Yet, a more inclusive polity may also affect the attitudes and behavior of the historically dominant group: American men. To test how messages of inclusion or exclusion foster political ambition, we conduct a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of 1200 U.S. citizens. We vary exposure to “two-minute civics lessons,” videos that depict either an all-male group or a gender-balanced group of early American political leaders. Contrary to our expectations, we find only very weak evidence that messages of inclusion foster women’s political ambition. Yet, we find strong responses from men. Messages that highlight the contributions of America’s “founding fathers” significantly increase men’s political ambition, a trend driven by white men and Republican men. We discuss how our findings speak to the current political moment, in which messages of men performing great deeds resonate with members of historically dominant groups.	Amanda Clayton

Research on candidate evaluations suggests that voters evaluate women differently from men with regard to their personality traits, issue competencies, and political ideology. Yet, little is known about how gender and disability intersect in influencing voters’ perceptions of candidates. Based on extant theories and evidence, we argue that gender and disability not only have additive effects on voters’ evaluations but also interact to produce specific stereotypes towards disabled female candidates. We also suspect that having a disability or contact with disabled people weakens the role of stereotypes. We conduct a conjoint experiment among a representative sample of the UK public (N=1,500) to test how candidates’ gender and disability shape voters’ perceptions of candidates as competent, compassionate, and progressive on policy issues. Respondents evaluate two hypothetical candidates with randomly assigned values on various dimensions including gender and disability. The findings provide new insights into how voters make choices and to what extent female candidates with disabilities are subject to unique attitudinal barriers when seeking elected office, which might help explain their overwhelming political under-representation.

We introduce a novel decomposition strategy to distinguish between discrimination by voters and discrimination by parties in the candidate nomination process. In doing so, we exploit the unique features of the German electoral system, where voters simultaneously cast votes for a party and for a candidate in their constituency. Using a panel of over 80,000 electoral precincts in the five most recent elections, we establish two findings: First, female district candidates nominated by the center-right CDU and the center-left SPD perform worse than their male counterparts. Second, the difference in performance is driven by party nomination strategies: The CDU and the SPD systematically nominate female candidates in districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for women to win those districts. In comparison, discrimination by voters accounts for a comparatively small part of the overall difference in electoral performance. Our findings have important implications for research on underrepresentation of women in politics, as they face an uphill battle to perform well in weaker districts.	Hanno Hilbig

How Anger and Fear Regulate Casualty Responsiveness	Extant research suggests that people rationally weigh the potential costs and benefits when deciding whether to support a military conflict. Importantly, as the prospects of casualties increase, public support for war decreases. Yet, we know little about why people sometimes are more or less concerned about casualties. Drawing on psychological research, we argue that the extent to which people are affected by information about casualty risks depends on their emotions of anger and fear. Specifically, we hypothesize that citizens become less responsive to casualties when experiencing anger in contrast to fear. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally prime anger and fear with treatment material unrelated to war. Afterwards we present respondents with an armed conflict scenario in which the risk of casualties is either high or low. The results corroborate our theoretical expectations. This research has implications for our understanding of when the public is willing to support conflicts with many lives on the line. Moreover, the findings suggest that elites could muster public support for war by stirring up public anger while tempering public fear.	Casper Sakstrup

Drawing on psychological research, we argue that the extent to which people are affected by information about casualty risks depends on their emotions of anger and fear. Specifically, we hypothesize that citizens become less responsive to casualties when experiencing anger in contrast to fear. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally prime anger and fear with treatment material unrelated to war. Afterwards we present respondents with an armed conflict scenario in which the risk of casualties is either high or low. The results corroborate our theoretical expectations. This research has implications for our understanding of when the public is willing to support conflicts with many lives on the line. Moreover, the findings suggest that elites could muster public support for war by stirring up public anger while tempering public fear.	Casper Sakstrup

Depression, Negativity Bias, and Political Evaluations	Several studies from political science, political communication and political psychology find evidence of negativity in democratic politics. We contribute to this vast literature and propose an additional source of negativity bias: depression. Depression is one of the most common mental health issues and has been found to affect voting and political participation more broadly. Research on cognition and depression theorises and demonstrates that depressed persons exhibit negative biases in the way they collect and process information. We argue that such biases may also apply to how individuals with depression assess politics. Thus we hypothesise that depressed persons evaluate political issues more negatively than non-depressed persons and test this expectation by using data from the European Social Survey. Our paper has important implications for political engagement and political efficacy.	Luca Bernardi

Using large scale survey data from Germany, we investigate the association between narcissistic admiration, narcissistic rivalry, social dominance orientation, rightwing authoritarianism, anti-immigrant sentiments, and preferences for the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The results reveal that narcissistic rivalry is positively associated with preferences for the AfD, while narcissistic admiration is negatively associated with support for the German far right, and that these relationships are essentially mediated via rightwing authoritarianism and anti-immigrant sentiments. These associations are robust against socio-demographic and structural differences, as well as differences in general ideology.

Explaining Political Attitudes and Behavior with Empathic Ability	Empathy plays a foundational role in morality and some argue that a lack of empathy is to blame for today's toxic political environment. Empathetic reactions emerge early in life and are modulated by interpersonal and contextual factors, especially group membership. Yet surprisingly little research has been undertaken to empirically asses if individual differences in empathic ability can explain political attitudes and behavior. This paper addresses this lacuna by identifying the effects of empathy in the context of two General Elections and two national referendums in the United Kingdom. Empathy is measured with a battery of ten items for 7691 respondents. The results demonstrate that empathic ability is a consistent predictor of attitudinal and behavioral differences between citizens, such as ideology, strength of partisan identity, interest in politics, turnout, political efficacy, candidate evaluation, policy preferences, happiness with referendum outcomes, and trust in MPs. Remarkably, the empathy scale used in this paper is better at predicting a number of attitudes and behaviors than the five-factor model, which has important consequences for the study of the effects of personality traits in political psychology.

The literature on the political effects of people’s local attachment is still very scarce. In this study, I provide accounts of whether and how locally oriented factors can motivate support or concerns about Brexit. I understand local indicators as encompassing both objective features in line with economic/immigration factors and subjective features that relate to community identity and belonging. Drawing from the real-world situation of Brexit, I use a survey experiment that exposes treated respondents with negative and positive implications of Brexit on local areas while leaving the control group with nationwide effects only. I find that treated respondents are more locally concerned about economic and social effects of Brexit than the control group no matter their position towards Brexit nor the content of the message. This brings evidence that we cannot evaluate voting behaviour without considering the community experiences’ identities in which individuals find themselves.	Diane Bolet

We focus on the Brexit referendum as a prominent example of such an event, and examine the effect of people’s emotional reactions to it on their incumbent support in the 2017 UK general election. We expect this effect to be conditional on how people voted in the referendum. Among ‘Leavers’, enthusiasm should increase the propensity to vote Conservative; among ‘Remainers’, anger should decrease the propensity to vote Conservative, while fear should increase prior loyalties. Turnout levels may also be related to emotional reactions, with enthusiasm fostering turnout among ‘Leavers’, while anger should have similar effects among ‘Remainers’. We test these expectations using a voter study conducted by YouGov in 2017.

Deservingness After Brexit	Public opinion about government programs is thought to hinge heavily on perceptions of the perceived deservingness of program beneficiaries. Almost all research on these kinds of judgements has therefore focused on personal attributes, like sex, race, or unemployment, that diminish perceived deservingness. Recent theoretical explanations for deservingness judgments are rooted in the psychology of in-group reciprocity and punishment of group members perceived as lazy. We suggest that deservingness judgements can also be colored by political attributes of potential beneficiaries, with political out-groups seen as less deserving than in-groups, all else constant. Amidst Britain's ongoing process of leaving the European Union as a context, we use a nationally representative survey experiment to measure in-group and out-group deservingness. We find that not only political viewpoints but also participation in the referendum vote, drive judgments of deservingness. These results suggest that deservingness judgments can be tied not only to perceived contributions to small-group welfare but also large-scale political choices and actions.	Sara Hobolt

While neither outcome appears likely, Brexit does raise a stark question for the populations of Scotland and Northern Ireland: do they feel more of a sense of shared identity and destiny with England, or with Ireland and the other EU member states? This paper uses automated text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, to compare newspaper coverage of the EU in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, as well as mutual coverage of one another. I analyze tens of thousands of articles to identify patterns in the tone and framing of coverage. I further compare the results to voting patterns in the Brexit referendum and the Scottish independence referendum of 2014.

However, existing explanations cannot explain many observed political coalitions. Thus far, politicians’ personal characteristics have been ignored as potential drivers of coalition formation. This paper asks whether politicians prefer to form political coalitions with individuals who share relevant individual characteristics (the homophily principle). To test this idea, this paper conducts a conjoint experiment included in a survey of 900 Spanish mayors, in order to reveal a causal relationship between similarities in socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and education) and the willingness to form a coalition; as well as the mechanisms that explain why individual characteristics might matter. The experiment evaluates how politicians make decisions in certain situations by having them select a would-be governing partner from two randomly-varied candidate profiles. The experimental data shows that personal characteristics have a causal role in defining some combinations of coalitions between similar leader profiles and demonstrates a specific mechanism through which they can affect leaders’ choices in decision-making processes.

Electoral malpractice and political trust in democracies and autocracies	Electoral malpractices seem to be on the rise almost everywhere. While compromising legitimacy from a normative point of view, we know little about the consequences electoral malpractice has for empirical legitimacy. This paper proposes a negative effect of electoral malpractice on political trust that is contingent on the type of political system. It argues that regime type affects both the relevance citizens ascribe to the freedom and fairness of elections and the extent to which citizens can become aware of electoral malpractices. In autocracies, for one, citizens might – based on past experience – already expect some irregularities surrounding the electoral process and thus not be as sensitive to violations of electoral integrity as citizens in democracies. Second, citizens in autocracies are also less likely to become aware of electoral malpractices due to limitations on media freedom. We would therefore expect a stronger negative effect of electoral malpractice in more democratic regimes. Combining V-Dem data on the electoral process with survey data for more than 100 democracies and autocracies, this paper tests its propositions using multi-level structural equation modeling.

We challenge this assumption with a formal model of vote buying as a signaling game, in which a voter is uncertain about the politician’s monitoring capacity before observing her provision decision. We characterize a separating equilibrium in which the politician offers a private transfer only when she is equipped with monitoring technology, increasing the voter’s belief about her monitoring capacity and making vote buying effective. Experimental results verify the separating equilibrium; politicians’ provision of private transfers enhances voters’ belief about the politicians’ monitoring capacity, whereas the lack of private transfers weakens this belief. The main substantive insight of the model is that, by providing private transfers, a politician can effectively change the voters’ beliefs about her ability to monitor voter behavior at the polls.

We challenge this assumption with a formal model of vote buying as a signaling game, in which a voter is uncertain about the politician’s monitoring capacity before observing her provision decision. We characterize a separating equilibrium in which the politician offers a private transfer only when she is equipped with monitoring technology, increasing the voter’s belief about her monitoring capacity and making vote buying effective. Experimental results verify the separating equilibrium; politicians’ provision of private transfers enhances voters’ belief about the politicians’ monitoring capacity, whereas the lack of private transfers weakens this belief. The main substantive insight of the model is that, by providing private transfers, a politician can effectively change the voters’ beliefs about her ability to monitor voter behavior at the polls. Therefore, even when institutions make monitoring vote choices unfeasible, politicians can buy votes as long as small doubt about ballot secrecy remains in voters’ minds.	Sergio Ascencio

In short, does the truth matter? I elicit truth perceptions in a novel statement rating task, asking respondents to judge the veracity of real statements from politicians, and I experimentally investigate how the availability of source cues affect these perceptions. Comparing perceptions to the evaluations of an independent, fact-checking organization, I find that perceptions track the truth. While source cues increase polarization, they do not substantially diminish this relationship, except in the case of highly polarizing speakers. Overall, the results suggest that political lie detection is possible through the aggregation of individual perceptions, even in the face of formidable partisan forces.	Jonathan Woon

Using data from Spanish local elections (1983-2015), we study a high stakes situation: securing the absolute majority of seats in the local council to bypass the negotiation with other parties. We apply a regression discontinuity design to show that certain parties are systematically more likely to obtain just enough votes to seize the pivotal seat than other parties. We show that this is unlikely to be driven by an exceptionally efficient mobilization of voters. We further examine whether this occurs within the election station premises or later on, when contentious votes are scrutinized by hierarchically superior electoral authorities.

We show that parents who anticipate childbirth close to or on election day are substantially more likely to cast an early vote, which counters some of the drop in turnout due to childbirth. Furthermore, the gender gap in turnout due to childbirth is larger among low-skilled parents, which can be explained by high-skill parents being more likely to compensate the anticipated drop in turnout by casting an early vote.

But we still know little about how and why sitting politicians make money. We know even less about the consequences of legislative self-enrichment on the electorate and the policymaking process. I argue that legislators' ability to self-enrich is conditioned by their electoral safety and their ability to influence the policymaking process. I leverage all of the financial interests disclosed by Members of Parliament in the past decade. My initial results indicate that lawmakers' electoral margins and financial interests are positively associated with each other. Moreover, members of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties report more financial financial interests. Further work explores the effect of financial disclosure reports on voters' preferences for Brexit. In an era of self-enriching elites, these findings cast a harsh light on the motivations and ambitions of our political leaders.	Kevin Fahey

Access to affordable housing is one of the hottest political issues in the UK. Recent press coverage has highlighted the fact that around one quarter of British MPs are landlords, renting out homes to tenants, and argued that landlord MPs have voted against measures to increase the housing supply and other measures to improve the quality and quantity of rented housing. This paper takes a systematic approach to discovering whether these concerns are true. It combines scraped data from the Register of MPs' Financial Interests going back to the late 1990s with comprehensive data on voting and speeches by MPs on housing policy, asking whether landlord MPs vote and speak distinctively on housing policies compared to other similar non-landlord MPs. Initial results suggest that there is some tendency for landlord MPs to vote and speak against the interests of tenants and non-homeowners. This raises the possibility that MPs are voting to protect their own direct financial interests, skewing housing policy towards the interests of a narrow elite, and that the over-representation of the wealthy in parliament may have policy consequences.

Politicizing corruption within and beyond the populist divide	In Central and Eastern Europe, corruption has become a central issue of electoral campaigns. Initiatives such as Transparency International, the WGI by the World Bank and the European Union have emphasized the fight of corruption as important indicator for government performance, spilling over to opposition campaigns and political debates. More recently, however, the topic corruption has gained momentum on different terms. Populist parties praise ‘the good people’ and demonize the ‘corrupt political elite’ that do not represent the popular will. In political terms, corruption has become more than the narrow definition of corrupt acts, making the fight of corruption an ambivalent issue. This paper sheds light on the term corruption in electoral campaigns by analyzing how the salience of anti-corruption claims correlates with other party characteristics, and particularly, how the patterns change over time. Using a new expert survey for 41 elections in 11 CEE countries, I show that anti-corruption claims have indeed gained in popularity among (radical) anti-establishment parties, and discuss under which circumstances the fight of corruption has been able to co-exist as issue beyond the populist divide.

Focusing on party leaders in the United States Congress, this paper builds on the extended party network (EPN) literature by examining the relationship structures that result from campaign contributions. Previous works on elite party relationships have tended to limit their focus to interactions within Congress. Though these works contribute to our understanding of elite relationships, US political parties are comprised of more than just their Congressional divisions, including a wide range of actors outside of formal governing institutions who hold substantial sway over intra-party forums. Historically, Congressional leaders have advanced their careers by drawing on their extensive donor networks for the benefit of their parties. Left unanswered is whether certain individuals are inherently more talented at building political relationships or whether these ties arise simply from holding the positions within leadership. This paper utilizes network analysis to examine how leader-based donor networks evolve over the course of their careers. This allows me to probe whether the relationship networks of leaders emerge prior to their promotion to the leadership team.	Jordan HSu

It has been found that policy expertise earned in committees help explain legislator’s focus on particular policy brief. Yet little attention has been paid in the existing literature on another source of policy expertise: the prior profession and experiences of legislators. This paper seeks to explore if legislators’ attention among various policy areas is affected by the amount of prior experience that they have acquired in related professions. A unique data set of MPs prior professional and political career is collect and used to test against their attention on particular policy area in parliamentary debate, which is determined by topic modelling on the corpus of legislative speeches in the 2010-2015 British parliament. The result seeks to demonstrate that MPs’ prior profession does affect the kind of policy area that they focus on once elected to Westminster, which would have implication on the idea of representation based on profession and sectorial interest.

Gaining access to government office is essential to political parties. However, once in office, the party has to delegate executive powers to individual ministers, risking a loss of control as ministers might depart from the party line. The more important the ministerial post to fill, the higher the party’s stakes when taking these decisions. While the bulk of the literature on ministerial selection studies the overall selection into cabinet, this paper explores how parties select ministers for individual ministerial portfolios of varying salience. Based on a comprehensive data set on the party and public office careers of Austrian ministers and junior ministers (1945–2018; n=562), the paper finds that ministerial candidates’ party careers are crucial in determining the portfolios allocated to them. However, these effects vary substantially, not only between parties but also over time. In studying the changing role of party careers in ministerial selection, this paper contributes new insights on the intra-party dimension of government formation and on the power relations between the party in central office and the party in public office.

The European Parliament, the only directly elected body in the European Union, has held elections since 1979 and provides a political arena that is multi-level and supranational. Does dynastic behavior exist in the same way in supranational politics as it does in national politics? This paper uses a cross national dataset of MEPs in the European Parliament that maps dynastic connections to both legislator careers and electoral outcomes from 1994 until 2014. I find that there are EP dynasties, but that these politicians don’t necessarily behave as EU careerists. Further, I find a significant presence of MEPs with national dynastic links, and these members are less likely to participate in legislative activities. MEP dynasts are almost exclusively composed of national political families, demonstrating that political families are exploiting multi-level political institutions.	Alexandra Cirone

In addition, the institutional framework of EP electoral institutions and voter behavior provides politicians from smaller and ideologically fringe parties with easier access to elected office than in domestic competitions. Using original biographical data on all MEPs serving since the 1979 EP elections and building upon previous work on the candidates selection strategies of fringe parties at the EP level, I assess the likelihood of a sitting MEP to use their position to then stand for local or national office, as well as examine which of the legislative behaviors demonstrated while serving as an MEP may make them more likely to win such elections. My analysis contributes to a growing literature on the shifting political cleavages in Europe and questions its impact on the career behavior of its politicians. It also works to empirically unpack the diversity of fringe MEPs and their ability to affect national political party competition.	William Daniel

Signals with a common source are likely to be correlated. If correlated information is shared in committee deliberation, rational actors account for the correlation in their information updating and end up with unbiased Bayesian beliefs about the state of the world. However, experimental evidence shows that people have problems in accounting for correlation between multiple signals. They neglect the correlation to some degree. I use a formal model of decision making in committees that involves limited deliberation to show how correlation neglect biases beliefs of naïve individuals and affects strategies and decisions of committees. Committee members who treat signals falsely as independent are almost certain to end up in a different belief about the correct decision than those who account for correlation between private signals. Correlation does not alter the voting behavior and information sharing of committee members if they are all from the same type. In committees with both types of individuals, correlation between signals increases incentives for strategic voting and information sharing.	Samuel David Mueller

Answering this question has been difficult due to data limitations. In this paper, we circumvent this issue by focusing on an issue---prohibition---for which high-quality data regarding public opinion exists in the form of votes on state-level ballot referenda. Using county-level referendum returns, we create measures of citizen preferences over prohibition at the legislative district level for states in both the South and the non-South. We then examine the relationship between preferences and roll call votes on temperance-related issues in the U.S. House and on votes to ratify the Eighteenth Amendment in state legislatures, comparing the strength of this relationship between the South and non-South. We find that while legislators in the non-South were somewhat more responsive to constituent preference, the relationship in the South was also quite strong. This indicates that, at least on one salient issue, the absence of vibrant two-party competition did not prevent legislative representation in the one-party South.	James Snyder

Are the decisions they make in the statehouse reflective of the wishes and needs of their constituents, or do other influences--their own preferences, those of their party, and those of special interests--hold more sway? We don’t have much insight on this representational question because of huge problems in measurement at this level of government. Understanding the receptiveness of individual state legislators and in aggregate to such varied influence will help us to predict the course of coalitions that can be constructed in each state to pass a diverse set of health reform policies. Using the context of state health care policy, I conduct original surveys with tens of thousands of respondents to allow me to estimate district level opinion using MRP, which has hitherto been used at the state level. I also use the newest iteration of my state legislative ideology dataset (Shor and McCarty 2011), along with newly gathered interest group data. These new measures help us to understand representation at this level.	Boris Shor

This bias might be explained by parliaments being largely made up of wealthy and highly educated representatives. While empirical evidence confirms that the presence of women and ethnic minorities in parliament significantly enhances the implementation of their preferences, research on the impact of the socio-economic background of MPs is scant. This contribution seeks to fill this void by measuring preference congruence of citizens and political elites with the help of hierarchical regression models using individual-level data from the European Election Study and elite-level data from the Comparative Candidates Survey. On the individual level, the analysis tests whether congruence between citizens and elites is stronger when they share the same socio-economic background. At the aggregate level, the article maintains that the social background of individual MPs has a smaller impact for left-wing parties since those parties traditionally defend the interests of the poor. Diverging levels of congruence have important implications because the numerical underrepresentation of the poor in European parliaments threatens their substantive representation in the political process.

While there are many studies of government survival, prime ministerial survival is by far not as well studied. I provide a framework to study prime ministerial survival. I argue that prime minister replacements by rival parties (inter-party politics) are governed by factors unlike those that drive replacements by the prime minister party (intra-party politics). I show evidence for this claim using competing risk models and data from 20 Western democracies in the period 1951-2014. I find that factors that decrease rival party replacement risk (e.g., PM party is largest party in parliament), increase PM party replacement risk and vice versa. The findings have major implications for the study of governments, prime ministers and political representation.	Roni Lehrer

So far, most evidence comes from elections that return a single office-holder, leaving unclear the impact of incumbency in multi-member district proportional systems. This lack of knowledge is troubling: in such systems, disentangling personal from party incumbency advantage is methodologically challenging and substantively consequential: candidates compete between and within-parties and face two-layered accountability (constituency and party). We exploit a feature of the Greek electoral system (the 50-seat bonus) that generates quasi-random variation in incumbency: in a quasi-random sample of districts, at least one seat is gifted to the national winner-party irrespective of its performance in that district. Using two different identification strategies (IV and matching), we find that being a bonus-MP has positive effects on both electoral performance and re-selection. We identify a possible mechanism which is conditioned by district magnitude: intra-party competition increases with district magnitude thus forcing incumbents to exert higher public spending effort. Our results are consistent to theories of intra-party competition in open-list PR systems and shed light on the individual underpinnings of incumbency advantage in such systems.

We explore the extent to which “New Conservatives”—i.e., the Tea Party, Liberty, and Freedom Caucuses—succeeded in shifting policy outcomes rightward by adding conservative amendments to measures that later passed the US House of Representatives. We do so by focusing primarily on data from the 112th through 115th Congresses (2011-2018). We find that while New Conservatives offer many amendments and the House agrees to many of their amendments, there is little evidence that their amendments lead to House passage of legislation that is more conservative than legislation without New Conservative amendments.

We explore the extent to which “New Conservatives”—i.e., the Tea Party, Liberty, and Freedom Caucuses—succeeded in shifting policy outcomes rightward by adding conservative amendments to measures that later passed the US House of Representatives. We do so by focusing primarily on data from the 112th through 115th Congresses (2011-2018). We find that while New Conservatives offer many amendments and the House agrees to many of their amendments, there is little evidence that their amendments lead to House passage of legislation that is more conservative than legislation without New Conservative amendments. Our results suggest multiple possible explanations: perhaps, when offering amendments, New Conservatives are more pragmatic than they are sometime credited for being; or perhaps there the process that determines which amendments are voted on is more likely to preclude votes upon, or perhaps even the offering of, New Conservatives’ most conservative amendments.

As encapsulated by the notion of parties’ issue ownership and issue voting, the capacity to handle problems is central to political parties’ electoral fortunes, and retrospective performance voting is widespread. Yet, research on how parties respond to problems is very limited. In fact, we know very little systematically on the broader questions about which problems parties propel to the political agenda and which they ignore – even if such questions motivated the initial interest in political agenda setting. We know that political parties in large part decide which policy issues reach the political agenda, but we do not know the logic underlying the problem response. Part of the barrier to such research is that we rarely have detailed and frequent data on parties’ issue emphasis. To overcome this challenge, this paper classifies 25,000 press releases from the multiple parties in the Danish parliament 2004-2017. This allows an analysis of the extent to party competition influences problem responsiveness.	henrik seeberg

By dissecting party platforms, I show that the very politicization of issues is already permeated with inequality before democratic decision-making even begins. Issue agendas worldwide predominantly reflect the concerns of male, educated and wealthy voters. That parties disregard large social groups when selecting campaign issues may seem surprising given that agenda setting is inherently public. However, my analysis reveals that looming electoral backlash is anticipated by a strategy of “discreet inequality.” In particular, parties strive to appear inconspicuous and non-threatening by exempting issues from unequal treatment that voters perceive as divisive and/or unpleasant. Discreet inequality thus appeases marginalized groups while ignoring their views on the large majority of more ordinary issues. The paper demonstrates these patterns for gender, education and income using comparative survey and manifesto data covering 42 countries.	Till Weber

Partisan Welfare Politics in Advanced Capitalism	Post-industrialization has changed labour markets and led to an increased and reconfigured support coalition for the welfare state. Whereas both working and middle class voters are generally supportive of a big welfare state, the former increasingly votes for the radical right and the latter for the left. Faced with broad demand for social policy, we would expect parties to converge on social policy issues. However, this convergence is not to be expected if the overall high support for the welfare state masks underlying divides regarding the priorities different social groups attribute to different types of social policies, in particular investment vs. consumption. Once we account for this divide in priorities, we expect parties to differ in the type of welfare state they advocate. Building on the concept of issue yield, I show that parties strategically promote social policies that are prioritized within their core electorate and among their potential electorate, resulting in the observation that left parties more strongly weight investment, whereas radical right parties emphasise consumption. The analyses combine original data on voters’ social policy priorities with manifesto data.	Michael Pinggera

This paper analyzes what party features determine the weights parties bear on the government policy compromise. Although, when it comes to cabinets, the literature expects weights to be proportional to seats, Gamson’s law, there is no reason that this translates to policies. This study innovates by directly estimating the bargaining weights. It uses the Comparative Manifesto Project’s unique coding of both parties and government policy position for several Western European countries over half a century. Subsuming the possibility that weights are proportional to seat share, the analysis finds no support for such hypothesis. The paper tests alternative hypotheses and factors that may predict the coalition government’s policy position.	Alessio Albarello

Existing policy-driven theories of coalition formation struggle to explain the inclusion of parties that do not easily fit onto a common policy dimension. This is especially so with parties that do not express positions on the given system’s main issue dimension. Using a new typology of parties based the concept of “representational claims”—what and who parties claim to represent—I argue that we can better understand coalition formation by accounting for parties’ engagement in both the politics of issues (appeals on policy positions) and the politics of identity (appeals to demographic groups). Specifically, I hypothesize that among non-formateur parties, those that emphasize demographic over policy appeals are more likely to be included in coalitions. That is so because a demographic rather than a policy emphasis is assumed to be less costly and because it is easier to accommodate in a variety of minimally connected coalitions. After explaining the party typology and the coalition formation model, I test my hypothesis on the cases of Israel, the Netherlands and Belgium between 1998 and 2017 and discuss the implications of the results.

When and how parties signal their preferred coalitions is of particular interest to our understanding of dynamics in multi-party politics. We expect there to be different patters throughout the electoral cycle. First, parties will send more signals during the campaign compared to during the term in order to increase their chances of being voted into office. Second, during the term, parties will mostly send negative signals towards each other in an attempt to highlight their own competence. Third, coalition parties will diverge from this pattern and not send negative signals towards each other, since doing so would only harm the government unity. I test these expectations using quantitative text analysis of more than 20,000 press releases published by the German parties between 2000 and 2010. The findings reveal parties' strategies of communicating their coalition preferences throughout the whole electoral cycle in proportional systems.	Anna Adendorf

However, despite the liberalizing measures in the 1980s and 1990s, several countries adopted only partial liberalization of their capital accounts. Similarly, transitory controls, designed in periods of financial instability, became permanent. Although the empirical literature has addressed the impact of different determinants on the level of controls, little is known about how these determinants interact and forge Hybrid regimes of capital account regulation. Relying on data for 84 countries between 1995 and 2015, this article uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore on what grounds these regimes have been built. Results reveal that emerging and developing countries have built Hybrid regimes to respond the domestic demand for protection from economic interests (industrial sector) and vulnerable social groups (politically represented by left-wing political parties) in face of recurrent currency crises. In the absence of these crises or domestic pressure for regulation, democratic countries have favored Open regimes, while left-wing authoritarian governments have built Closed ones.	Pedro Silva

Insurgents have the advantage of indoctrinating part of the population, ensuring support but at the cost of reduced education. Our framework highlights a novel effect of strategic indoctrination, which strengthens insurgent capacity. Specifically, we find indoctrination increases the amount of anti-regime activity, but not necessarily the insurgency's effectiveness. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which a government may underinvest in education to balance the risk between educating citizens -- making them more highly skilled for economic participation -- versus inadvertently strengthening future insurgent effectiveness. We develop a theory linking investment in education under the threat of insurgency to intentional under-provision of education, with implications for the effectiveness of insurgent and counterinsurgent activities. We then consider the effect of foreign investment in the education sector and its downstream effects on both domestic education expenditures and conflict outcomes.

The research is twofold: 1) descriptively quantifying the level of spatial autocorrelation via NOMINATE scores, and 2) causally assessing the impact of neighbourhood effects on individual Senator's voting behaviour. We first develop various spatial weights matrices to outline the nature of spillover effects, using contiguity measures, Euclidean distance, and Zhang and Wang's (2016) asymmetric method (which incorporates both physical and ideological proximity). We then use Akaike's information criteria to justify the best choice of matrix. To account for both spatial and temporal dimensions of the data, which is pooled cross-sectional, we then create a spatio-temporal weights matrix inspired by Dubé and Legros (2012), incorporating the previous choice of spatial weight, and then use this in various one-, two-, and three-source models of spatial autocorrelation. Finally, to causally test for peer effects, we use the deaths of Senators as an identification strategy to investigate whether neighbourhood effects do influence voting behaviour of newly incumbent Senators. A basic difference-in-difference approach is employed.	Christopher Dann

The Economic Impact of Benedict’s Rule in medieval England	Early middle age Benedictine monasteries were characterized by the strict adherence to Benedict’s rule, establishing that the Abbot was an elective office (with majority rule), that his powers were constrained by the Rule itself and that he had an obligation to consult with the community on important decisions. At the same time, monasteries were feudal landlords, alongside with secular noblemen, governing over a wide range of manors. Were those (relatively) more inclusive institutions making a difference in the way manors were governed? To answer this question, we compare economic outcomes of secular and monastic manors in early medieval England. We analyse detailed data on more than 30.000 manors from the Domesday Book, combining fixed-effect, matching and spatial econometrics techniques. Preliminary results show that manors ruled by Benedictine monasteries experienced larger income growth, controlling for a wide set of potential confounding factors at the county and local district level. Finally, the result is robust when the analysis is restricted to the subsample of manors whose lord did not change throughout the observed period.	Federico Trombetta

Kings College London, United Kingdom	p	85653	525	The origin of effective formal institutions: theory and evidence from medieval England.	Despite the recognition that institutions have a great impact on economic and political development, the same formal institutions can vary in effectiveness across different societies. When are formal institutions effective? And when are effective formal institutions put in place? I address these questions in a framework inspired by the institutional changes that took place in England in the 13th century. The framework emphasizes that formal institutions are effective only when they formalize existing custom. These institutions will tend to be chosen by strong kings, who will then have an incentive to keep them in place and slow down the process of institutional development. Consistent with path dependence, the progressive improvement of institutions requires precise timing.	Gabriel Leon

Individual employment biographies are increasingly characterized by highly heterogeneous sequences of risk exposure. Over and beyond personal experiences in the labor market, latent threats to secure employment vary in intensity, timing, and volatility as a function of individual labor market transitions and macro-economic trends. Focusing on these risk dynamics, we analyze voters’ political reactions to different trajectories of employment security. Using high-quality household panels from three West European countries, we construct a time-sensitive measure of sectoral-occupational risk, analyze fluctuations in risk exposure over the course of individual employment biographies, and establish the magnitude and persistence of effects of changes in risk exposure on issue and party preferences.

We argue that globalisation and the spread of IT technologies has pushed these parties and their voters in opposite directions. Socialdemocracy adapted to globalisation by making policy concesions that eroded their credibility as redistribution champions. For voters, globalisation and IT technologies increased the level of socio-economic risk among voters from different social-class origins. The common expectation is that these voters demanded more redistribution and, hence, would support socialdemocratic platforms. We argue, however, that given the policy concesions made by these parties in the past, voters no longer trust traditional socialdemocratic parties and, consequently, no longer support them. We find empirical support for these claims using individual and aggregate data from the UK. Exploiting the BHPS panel survey, we show how preferences for redistribution exist while support for the Labour party declines. We confirm these results by using a novel dataset that combines electoral and census data at the district level for all general elections in the United Kingdom since 1981.	Rubén Ruiz-Rufino

Attitudes Towards Globalization in the Age of Automation	Many, especially low-skilled workers, blame globalization for their economic woes. Robots and machines, which rendered many routine jobs obsolete, are often viewed much more forgivingly. Elites and citizens celebrate technological advances as they mostly encounter technology in forms that enhance their lives. Immigrants and workers abroad, on the other hand, unfamiliar to most, make convenient targets for blame in an anti-globalization discourse that is laden with group cues. This paper argues that citizens tend to misattribute blame for economic dislocations toward immigrants and workers abroad, while discounting the effects of technology and automation. Using the 2016 American National Elections Studies (ANES) data, I show that individuals who are exposed to automation feel less secure about their jobs, and are more likely to support restrictions on trade and immigration.

While both models have limitation in measuring the sole effect of globalization/automation in risk formation, a randomized experiment allow us to separate and gauge the real individual perceptions. The existing arguments posit a link between economic concern derived from upcoming market changes and redistribution preferences. We find instead that there is little effect of labour market threats in shaping risks.

How Credit Regimes and Welfare States Shape Household Indebtedness	Debt has become an essential part of many families' daily lives. Yet we know little about the links between household indebtedness, credit markets, and the welfare state. In this paper, I propose a theoretical framework that suggests that credit markets fill the gap between families' financial needs and welfare states' financial support. Individuals increasingly go into debt to 'move onward' and address social risks as well as to 'move upward' and seize social opportunities. As these responsibilities shift from the public sphere onto individuals, credit markets emerge as private alternatives to social policies in cases where permissive credit regimes enable individuals to more easily borrow money. I substantiate this theory with macro level and micro-level panel data and demonstrate considerable cross-national variation in coping mechanism in response to unemployment. I then compare Danish and American households using event studies and difference-in-differences designs to document that how different degrees of risk protection in both countries leads to differential rates of borrowing. These findings have socio-economic and political consequences for wealth inequality, support for the welfare state, and social solidarity.	Andreas Wiedemann

The political economy literature suggests that decisions about sovereign debt management are affected by the anticipated asymmetric consequences of particular fiscal policies on different segments of society. However, work in cognitive psychology shows that individuals significantly depart from expected utility considerations, when acting on probability assessments. Against this background, I adopt a bounded rationality approach and develop an agent-based model that explores which factors determine the policy preferences of distressed countries' incumbents. In particular, I implement a two-level game where debt-related fiscal policies result from repeated interactions between the incumbents of a debtor country and the representatives of official as well as private lenders, as determined by continuous negotiations within the two groups. By accounting for the political, economic, and institutional factors that influence countries' debt sustainability, I show how heterogeneous and interconnected actors adapt to an evolving environment, with a view toward discriminating among competing mechanisms and predicting patterns of behavior in sovereign debt governance.

Governments nevertheless require revenue to respond to their constituents and to remain in power. When the costs to raising revenue increase, governments must find ways to generate demand for their own debt. We present data documenting a new set of policies, borrowing privileges, which include mandates that institutional investors and collective investment funds hold their assets in government bonds. Borrowing privileges are unpopular with financial actors, as they may force investors to hold assets with lower returns and prevent portfolio diversification. We show that governments implement borrowing privileges to shore up demand for their debt when their borrowing costs are high. These policies are less common when financial actors are more influential, for example when the banking sector is concentrated. Most generally, the analysis shows that the government retains the ability to regulate even mobile assets, at the nexus between the financial service provider and its predominantly immobile customers.

We use foreign currency borrowing of households in Hungary, combined with a large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation, as a natural experiment to generate a shock to household debt burdens. Exploiting zip code level variation in the prevalence of foreign currency household loans, we show that a 10 percent unexpected rise in debt-to-income increases the vote share of the far-right party Jobbik by 3.2 percentage points. Foreign currency debt exposure accounts for 20 percent of the overall rise in the far-right vote share. This result is robust to a variety of alternative explanations for increased far-right support and is corroborated by survey data on debtors and far-right supporters. We present evidence that conflict between creditors and debtors over the resolution of the crisis is an important mechanism in the electoral success of the far right.	Gyozo Gyongyosi

We know that public-sector banks often increase lending in election years and that politicians benefit electorally from bank connections. The mechanisms and the conditions that facilitate politically motivated bank lending are, however, not yet explored. We study the case of German savings banks and use original bank-level data, including information on bank loans and politicians’ de facto representation in banks’ governing bodies for 294 savings banks in eight German states between 2006–2016 to estimate a difference-in-difference model. We find evidence that “de facto” political representation in bank governing bodies, not “de jure” public ownership, drive electoral lending cycles: politically motivated lending policies are particularly likely in banks in which politicians act as chairperson, when many board members are active politicians, and when politicians in the bank’s board belong to a single party. The effect is driven by savings banks with county-level chairpersons from the conservative party and robust to various specifications.	Jonas Markgraf

Nevertheless, policymakers should exercise oversight and reform these agencies when agencies fail to meet their objectives. This paper presents a principal-agent model to explore these competing incentives. The model shows that even unbiased policymakers refrain from reforming an inefficient agency if citizens cannot directly observe the bias of the policymaker and the outcome of the reform. Unbiased policymakers fear that they will be punished for their reforms, removed from office, and likely replaced by a more biased politician. For this reason, regulatory institutions, even when relatively ineffective, are likely to endure, as citizens do not trust politicians to reform them.	Amy Pond

These results are often taken as evidence that voters will not be able to hold politicians accountable for their actions. We probe this conclusion by formalizing a model of accountability where voters have both directional and accuracy motives in their beliefs. As long as moderate voters lack strong directional motives, not fully caring about accuracy does not seriously undermine accountability. The picture is less rosy if voters in the middle don't have weak directional motives, but have a ``motivation for moderation'', which makes them less responsive to politician behavior. We then consider extensions about how the media environment interacts with directional motives.	Andrew Little

With communication, a minority might to try to persuade the majority to take their interests into account, making fairness considerations more salient. Alternatively, communication may facilitate coordination, thereby enhancing the formation of majority coalitions and increasing inequality. Our participants must choose between a fair allocation and one or more unfair allocations, and in our design we elicit social preferences and manipulate the difficulty majorities face in coordinating on unfair allocations. This allows us to distinguish communication used for coordination from communication used to persuade others to consider fairness. Communication increases fairness in the absence of coordination problems, but promotes majority tyranny when coordination is difficult. We find that discussion affects behavior even though subjects' messages are mostly brief and instrumental, devoid of substantive meaning, and rarely mention fairness. Our results also suggest a behavioral consequence of introducing a coordination problem: voters overreact and choose fair outcomes more often than their underlying social preferences would predict.

We deviate from the literature that assumes that citizens collect information and vote with an eye on influencing the election outcome. Instead, we assume that political participation - acquiring information, participating in discussions, voting - is a social activity, driven by social concerns. Each citizen takes four actions. First, he can acquire information about the issues at stake in an upcoming election. This information may increase the probability that a citizen has a correct private opinion about these issues. Second, he decides what information to convey to the persons in his social environment. We model this by allowing citizens to send cheap-talk messages about their private opinions to each other. Third, on the basis of the discussions in his group, each citizen forms an opinion about the issues at stake. Formally, opinion forming is not an action, but just an updating of beliefs. Finally, each citizen decides whether or not to vote. The model generates a variety of predictions.	Otto Swank

We develop a voting model that endogenously generates electoral groups consistent with group-based voting by focusing upon like-minded voters. Like-minded voters are those voters who in equilibrium can agree on a best response given the behavior of all voters not within their faction. Restricting equilibria to those in which no like-minded faction has an incentive to deviate eliminates sincere voting and reduces the types of multi-position equilibria that may exist. If we consider turnout, there exist exclusively Duvergerian equilibria (those in which all voters vote for a very small number of positions), but with potentially bad welfare properties. For example, all positions that receive votes may be unanimously inferior to all positions that could have been chosen instead.	Benjamin Ogden

Here, we argue that mainstream right parties face trade-offs that are similar to those of the mainstream left. Taking hardline stances on immigration may allow them to appeal to socially-conservative working class voters. However, such a move will only be successful when coupled with more consumption policies. Yet, this strategy risks alienating the business oriented core electorate of the mainstream right. This is especially true in times of economic downturns and fiscal stress. We empirically investigate these questions at the party level and analyze how and under what conditions these strategies affect mainstream right vote shares. In a second step, using data from the ESS we investigate at the micro-level how different electoral groups respond to these strategies.

This paper advances a theory of money in politics in which contributions shape the content of the congressional agenda. We analyze the relationships between campaign donations and legislators' attention to eight economic issues in the nearly 500-million words spoken in Congress from 1995 to 2016. We find consistent evidence that organizations exert influence over the economic issues attended to by U.S. legislators. Contributions from labor unions increase legislators' attention to issues prioritized by the middle and lower classes and decrease attention to upper-class issues.

We propose a model to explore this question and test its implications using data from Colombian municipalities. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits institutional rules determining contribution limits based on population thresholds, we find that looser campaign limits reduce the number of donors per candidate and increase the average donations received by the winner of the election. Moreover, we document that donors who contributed to the winner of the election are more likely to receive contracts from the supported candidate upon taking office. These patterns suggest that looser campaign limits increase the influence of fewer individuals in campaigns. A higher influence of donors over elected officials is reflected by the fact that looser limits are associated with more kickbacks for each donor, which are awarded in a more discretionary way.

The Impact of Celebrities on IO Fundraising	Many international organizations that rely on voluntary funding collaborate with celebrity Goodwill Ambassadors to bring greater attention to their causes. This is an attractive advertising strategy for IOs: first, the increased attention can pressure governments to maintain funding to agencies. Second, celebrity endorsement may increase public donations, which come with fewer strings than government donations. Although individually small, public donations comprise a significant portion of agencies’ total revenues. Despite the significance of public donations to IO funding and, subsequently, their independence, there is limited research into the public appeal strategies of IOs and their effectiveness. We start to fill this gap by investigating the impact of celebrity endorsement on IO fundraising. Through a survey experiment, we address, first, whether a celebrity Ambassador appeal increases individuals’ likelihood to donate compared to expert appeals and, second, whether the effectiveness of a celebrity appeal is constrained by the political salience of the issue being propagated. Combined, these analyses advance our understanding of the fundraising mechanisms of IOs and also shed light on strategies available to IOs to enhance their independence vis-a-vis member states.

In particular, this paper addresses why the rupture with colonial power did not bring more inclusive economic institutions to new republics. To address this question, this paper focuses on the independence from colonial power of the Andean countries, using a game-theoretic approach. This paper shows how, in a society composed by two elites and a non-elite, the conflict between elites leads to: 1) confrontation, and 2) limited voting rights and persistence of extractive economic institutions. Two elements prevent the accommodation between the elites: their similar strength, and the incapacity of the political elite to coalesce with the non-elite. The ability of the economic elite to attract the non-elite to the independence militia provided a credible mechanism to redistribute wealth and political power; with this mechanism, an extension of the franchise - democracy - was not needed. These results contribute to the literature on the persistence of economic institutions, the conditions for the extension of voting rights, and on the independence of the Andean region.	Raul Aldaz

While preventing the occurrence of terrorist attacks is an important objective, defeating terrorist groups once for all should remain the ultimate goal of governments involved in the fight against terror. Using a game-theoretic model of the interaction between a government and a terrorist group, I assess the strategic consequences that deterring terrorism has on the long-term success against violent groups. Successful deterrence would imply a complete lack of action on the side of the terrorists. While this would guarantee perfect security in the short-run, it would prevent security agencies from capturing operatives and accessing useful information to accelerate the demise of the terrorist organization. Such a 'shut-out' strategy could be successful only if the terrorist organization is weak enough, in that it relies on terrorist acts to attract support and financing, while it would be suboptimal when facing a more resilient group. After identifying this trade-off, I assess how various political institutions interact with it and how this interaction affects the dynamics of terrorism prevention.	Livio Di Lonardo

Using a pivotal costly voting model of elections where sequentially acting voters have privately observed preferences over two candidates, I study how different information regimes (no disclosure, turnout disclosure, votes disclosure) affect voters' decisions to cast votes and what impact they have on voters' and candidates’ welfare depending on candidates' ex-ante support. First, I find that votes disclosure dominates the other regimes in terms of voters' welfare. Second, the ex-ante majority candidate has the highest chance to win under votes disclosure, the minority candidate with relatively substantial support benefits the most from turnout disclosure, while the minority candidate with low support is more likely to win under no disclosure. The last result implies that a particular choice of information regime by an agenda setting candidate may signal his support expectations.	Dmitriy Vorobyev

The impact of the Voting Rights Act on political violence	Does enfranchisement temper political violence ? This paper investigates the question theoretically and empirically in the context of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1960s US. I introduce a model featuring two groups competing over the control of public policies in two substitute contests: voting and rioting. Disenfranchisement occurs if the cost of voting is unequal among the two groups. This crowds out the discriminated group from the voting contest whereas the non-discriminated group wins the voting contest with a minimal investment (discouragement effect). Enfranchisement levels the playing fields. Both groups consequently increase voting while decreasing rioting. The VRA has forbidden discrimination in voting. Its coverage formula generated both geographic and temporal discontinuities in its application. The empirical strategy takes advantage of these features by comparing the evolution of political violence in geographically close covered and non-covered counties. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that VRA coverage reduced the incidence and the onset of political violence. I interpret these results as evidence that enfranchisement decreases political violence. Robustness checks lend credence to a causal interpretation of these results. Extensions validate the theoretical setting.	Jean Lacroix

We apply ideal point estimation techniques to roll call votes on franchise reform in the House of Commons between 1826 and 1918 to estimate the preferences of MPs on this issue. Our preliminary results imply three main conclusions. First, the process of democratization in Britain was partisan rather than consensual: although the median MP generally came to support a more generous franchise with time, conservative MPs were almost united throughout in opposing almost any suffrage extension. Second, the pace of electoral reform was governed by two factors: the gradual leftward drift of Liberal MPs, which only accelerated from the mid-19th century onwards, and the conservatism of early Liberal leaders. Our initial analyses suggest that the process of social and economic modernization in Britain may explain much of the variation in legislator preferences we observe.	Chitralekha Basu

Extending the right to vote from the rich to the middle class leads to increased spending, but further extensions lead to declines in expenditure. This prediction is tested by constructing a dataset of town council expenditure in Britain between 1867 and 1910. The effect of franchise extension is identified by exploiting regional and temporal variation in the right to vote. The results show strong support for the theoretical prediction, with government spending highest when around 50% of the adult male population was enfranchised.	Jonathan Chapman

However, endogeneity makes it difficult to estimate their independent impact empirically. To do this, I exploit the unique institutional context at the time when Switzerland introduced local female suffrage. Female enfranchisement was introduced conditional on a majority of men voting in favour in a local referendum, some of which had very narrow outcomes. With difference-in-differences, I compare election outcomes and government spending at the municipality level between cantons where women received the right to vote at different points in time between 1959 and 1990. First, I find an overall conservative shift caused by female suffrage. Second, comparing the causal effect of the institution “women’s suffrage' in Yes- and No-voting municipalities, I find significant electoral and spending differences, which show that ex-ante preferences influence the size but not the sign of the enfranchisement's impact. Third, I find that both preference-types of municipalities show a significant change of male support for a national franchise extension upon being exposed to female suffrage locally. I provide evidence unpacking the causal mechanism of this finding.	Selina Hofstetter

While the idea that women were to vote more for conservative parties when they got the right to vote rapidly emerged as conventional wisdom, others contradict this proconservative stance by showing that social expenditure grew after women won the political rights. I contribute to this literature by exploring the effect of women’s enfranchisement in the context of the Spanish Second Republic (1931-1939). This emerges as an ideal setting due to strong stereotypes held against women, the influence of religion, and existing levels of political polarization. Using newly-collected data and an Instrumental Variable approach based on higher mortality rates among men caused by war and illnesses, this paper analyzes the effect of female suffrage on vote choice and abstention. This project deepens our understanding of crucial historical events and its implications for the gender bias.	Toni Rodon

We investigate the effects of communication on the occurrence of majority domination. Theoretically, communication cuts both ways. On the one hand, forming and maintaining a coalition requires coordination between individuals, which is barely accomplishable without opportunities to communicate. On the other hand, communication strengthens pro-social orientations in groups and should thus prevent the exclusion of minorities. We argue that the pro-social effects of communication dominate when communication is public whereas exclusive majorities form under private communication. We test our claim in a series of laboratory experiments where five-member committees make distributional decisions using the voting mechanism ‘voting by veto’. Compared to a baseline treatment without communication, groups distribute benefits more equally when they have the opportunity to communicate in a public chat. When communication is private, however, we see the formation of majority coalitions that exclude a minority of group members.	Jan Sauermann

This paper suggests a conceptual framework that could be useful to inform this debate. We propose a model where the pros and cons of a strengthening of checks and balances are respectively the reduction of type-I errors and the increase of potential type-II errors in policy decision-making. Checks and balances are less desirable for intermediate levels of competence of the political class and more desirable when the bureaucracy is slower or less reliable in the implementation of political decisions, when the political system involves frequent turnover, and in policy areas where the welfare effects of a reform are harder to evaluate. We also show that political leaders may fail to adjust flexible constitutions to changes in the environment.	Massimo Morelli

This is achieved by specifying a level of protection above WTO Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) for FTA-specific lists of GIs. Statistical analysis of newly coded data for 11 FTAs shows that GIs with higher sales values are more likely to be protected. In contrast, the data do not support the hypothesis of lobbying by large and GI-rich countries. At first sight, these findings suggests a cost-benefit approach at protecting GIs outside of the EU. Yet one could question the overall benefit, since only about €1 billion of EU GI foodstuffs is exported outside of the EU. Identity aspects and the need to obtain public support for free trade seem to trump pure economic concerns in this area.	Martijn Huysmans

Unfortunately, reliable information on trade barriers has so far been unavailable, in particular, for non-tariff-barriers to trade (NTBs). Although NTBs make up the bulk of applied trade protection, few mandatory international reporting standards exist for these measures. In this paper, I present a method to statistically infer countries’ industry-level NTBs. Instead of relying on official data sources that are susceptible to biased reporting, I use observed trade frictions and information on trade elasticities to identify the size of unobserved trade barriers. Because of this indirect estimation method, my data are not affected by the self-selection and coverage problems prevalent in existing data sources. My protection data cover 160 countries and more than 200 industries. Expressed in terms of ad-valorem tariff-equivalents, these data provide a comprehensive picture of the pattern of trade protection around the world. I show that my NTB data strongly outperform other trade protection data in predicting depressed trade flows.	Marco Martini

The selection of Foreign Trade Barriers for WTO litigation	In order to curb the incentive to install WTO-inconsistent trade measures, the WTO agreements provide member states with the possibility to challenge other members’ trade policies. Over the last decades, WTO disputes have revolved around all kinds of foreign trade barriers (FTBs). However, a quick look at the list of WTO disputes indicates that certain FTBs are more prone to litigation than others. This paper studies why certain FTBs are often selected for WTO litigation whereas others are only seldom challenged. We present a game-theoretic approach and argue that the pre-litigation game that plays out in anticipation of a WTO dispute has a strong impact on the selection of FTBs for WTO litigation. The government-industry interaction that takes place before a WTO complaint is filed, determines the number of complaints, and which party provides the financial support for preparing a complaint. The veto power of governments in filing a WTO complaint explains why certain trade barriers, such as export barriers, are more prone to litigation than import-lowering FTBs.	Sven Van Kerckhoven

While different trade models (i.e., factors, sectors, or heterogeneous firms) help to derive predictions for openness vs. autarky, they are also uninformative about demands for different forms of integration to the trade network. Here, I argue that social preferences for trade policy depend on different combinations of trade exposure and diversification (in both exports and imports). This is the first systematic analysis of social preferences on the intensive and extensive margins of trade. I conduct conjoint survey experiments in 15 Latin American countries. The evidence shows that preferences for a wide range of alternative trade profiles vary across skills, economic sectors, type of firms in which individuals are employed, and the so-called 'love for variety'. Second, some trade profile attributes significantly affect perceptions of risk and demands for protection and compensation. This research has important implications for the literature on trade policy, preferences, and compensation.	Santiago López-Cariboni

Yet, researchers have not reached a shared consensus regarding causes of technological stagnation. We argue that firms can use two strategies to gain edge in competition: innovating themselves or blocking innovations developed by competitors. At the firm level, state-owned firms tend to invest in blocking rather than innovate because marginal returns to blocking, especially via political connections, exceed those of investments in R&D. At the country level, democratic institutions incentivize firms’ investment in innovations because politicians in democracies are more limited in their abilities to block technologies. A firm’s decision to innovate is, therefore, largely mediated by political institutions: while democratic settings incentivize firms to invest in innovations, authoritarian settings incentivize firms to block innovations. We employ Bayesian multi-level model that allows us to test both firm-level and country-level hypotheses within a unified framework and thereby provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of political determinants of economic backwardness.

We argue that state-building efforts increase division among local and national elites, which undermines local peacekeeping efforts and allows for uprisings to occur. As a result, for a given level of grievance, peasant revolts are more likely to be attempted and more likely to spread in areas where the elite is divided. We assess these ideas using subnational data on rebellion, tax centralization, and drought from the late 18th-century to the Mexican War of Independence. We show that droughts led to peasant uprisings during the late colonial period, and that their impact was magnified after a major elite split in 1808. During the war, insurgent mobilization was more likely in areas that experienced severe drought just before the onset of conflict, but also in areas of higher exposure to the Bourbon centralization of tax collection, which reduced the rents available to the local elite and thus elite loyalty to the government.

I develop a model to illustrate that the ameliorating effect of outmigration on land conflict can have an ambiguous effect on redistribution. Outmigration can reduce pressure on elites to redistribute land, but it may also lower the political and economic costs of reform. This can open up opportunities for increased mobilization and change. Conversely, a shock to the availability of exit options can lead to increased social mobilization for change, but it can also encourage elite repression. I present empirical support for the model using subnational evidence on migration opportunities, agrarian mobilization, and agrarian change in Mexico, El Salvador, and the Philippines. I conclude by discussing implications for migration and redistributive politics more generally.	Emily Sellars

Despite increased levels of dualism and free movement of labour in European countries over the last two decades, the effects of these policy developments are still unclear in the literature. This study argues that high concentrations of migrant workers in non-standard forms of employment decrease economic redistribution towards, and labour competition with, immigrants. Consequently, the politicisation of immigrant-native conflicts is paradoxically lower when immigration and labour market dualism cluster together at the occupational level. These claims are validated cross nationally, and in a difference-in-differences setting analysing the impact of the 2005 German Immigration Act.	Sergi Pardos-Prado

Economic Crises and Support for Regionalism in Europe	European regions are seeing significant levels of support for autonomy and independence. My argument is that widening economic inequality between regions and states in the wake of economic crises is exacerbated by governments' inability to respond to the resulting differentiated preferences. This relation is not only reflected in changes in vote choice following economic downturns, but also in the language parties use to communicate their regionalist agenda. On the voter level, I assess electoral support in a European sample of regions represented by regionalist parties in regional elections between 1950 and 2010. On the party level, I investigate how economic downturns are reflected in parties’ framing of decentralization demands in Spain using data from the Regional Manifestos Project for regional elections surrounding the 2009 crisis. I establish that economic crises are associated with increases in regionalist vote share, and find that positive changes decentralization demands by regionalist parties in Spain are accompanied by references to economic conditions. The findings shed new light on how economic downturns affect party systems, vote choice, and the performance and agendas of regionalist parties.	Friederike Luise Kelle

Scholars assume that this stability culture derives from the collective memory of hyperinflation. We study this theoretical mechanism directly; i.e., the effect of the hyperinflation narrative on German voters’ monetary policy preferences. Moreover, the hyperinflation frame may be so powerful that voters conceptualize hyperinflation and the Great Depression as being the same event, conflating hyperinflation in 1923 and deflation in 1932. We thus argue that informing Germans that the Great Depression was a deflation crisis induces more support for expansionary monetary policy. After all, this would lead them to revise their implicit understanding of the economic crisis most proximate to the collapse of the Weimar Republic. We run a survey experiment among 2500 German voters and focus on two outcome measures: preferences for ECB policy and the inflation-unemployment trade-off. We run the same experiment among Dutch voters, where we expect no effect of the hyperinflation narrative, as the Netherlands did not have to face a hyperinflation crisis.	Nils Redeker

In this paper, we explain this puzzle by drawing and testing a new conceptualization of redistributive preferences. In some political contexts - even where inequality is very high – individuals will not perceive a necessary trade-off where citizens must pay taxes in order for the poor to benefit from social spending. We test this expectation through the analysis of a conjoint experiment embedded into an original survey conducted in Mexico City and Bogota. We find that citizens of all income levels in both cities have strong preferences against taxing the poor, but only citizens in Bogota would choose to tax the rich.

An experimental assessment of the effect of income inequality on political attitudes	Standard behavioral models predict that income inequality would lead to an increase in concern with inequality and support for redistribution. Yet, evidence for this expectation is mixed. On one hand, some scholars show that low income individuals or those living in more unequal neighbourhoods or localities are more concerned with inequality than those who are not. On the other hand, there is evidence that income differences are generally perceived as being legitimate by the public. Drawing on system justification theory, which suggests that most individuals are motivated to believe to perceive the social system as fair, some showed that individuals habituate to rise in income inequality by adjusting their expectations of fairness, which leads them to be even more accepting of inequalities. These studies use different data, methods, and different dependent variables that prevent us from arriving at conclusions about the effects of income inequality on individual attitudes. Using online survey experiments from nationally representative samples from the United States and the United Kingdom and direct measures of concern with income inequality, I test both propositions simultaneously.

In this paper, we study the effect of social status on redistributive preferences among politicians. Taking federalized Switzerland as a case, we focus on cantonal MPs as the cantons have far-reaching power over the allocation of welfare and are thus the ideal case to study.

Using a panel of 12,000 German municipalities over 8 years, we show that decreased local spending led to increased vote shares for right-wing parties in the national elections but did not affect vote shares of incumbent district candidates. To obtain causal estimates, we exploit errors in the 2011 German census. The census population estimates determine how federal taxes are redistributed to municipalities. For a number of municipalities below a pre-specified population threshold, the 2011 census underestimated population changes by more than 50%. This allows us to obtain quasi-random variation in per-capita transfers and spending. The results suggest that local government spending can have repercussion for voting at the national level, but that voters do not punish their local incumbents.	Hanno Hilbig

Despite mixed findings, research in political economy has cemented the notion that diverse democracies are less cohesive and thus maintain smaller welfare states. However, a separate literature on individual-level preferences finds that intergroup solidarity varies by its contextual environment, particularly intergroup inequality and geographic contact. Bridging this theoretical and empirical gap, I argue that diversity dampens redistributive outcomes only and insofar as it is reinforced by either intergroup inequality or regional segregation. These two mediating factors, however, have different redistributive implications. Diversity with higher intergroup inequality fractures solidarity along class lines, thus furthering regressive policies that underprioritize the poor. Diversity with higher regional segregation, meanwhile, fractures solidarity along geographical lines, thus advancing decentralized redistribution at the expense of a robust national system. I find empirical support in these hypotheses using cross-sectional time-series data from 22 democracies over 31 years. Hence, I show that the negative relationship between diversity and redistribution depends on complex cleavage structures with different redistributive implications.	Alon Yakter

In this article, I posit that social insurance defines the scope of other-regarding preferences. The welfare state provides benefits to insure against individual exposure to labor market risks. Some welfare states provide social safety nets and benefits are provided in equal amounts to everyone, while in others, benefits are related to previous earnings and stabilize individual incomes over the life-cycle. These structural differences define the relative impact of labor market risks on individual income, and consequently, the stability of one's living status over time. I employ simulated unemployment replacement rates to construct a measure for the governing principle of social insurance and show that average support for redistribution is higher in earnings-related systems. Labor market risk has a stronger impact on redistribution preferences in flat-rate systems. Experimental evidence shows that risky endowments influence transfer shares negatively. Previous social insurance approaches have not taken into account the other-regarding perspective.	Verena Fetscher

Its main questions are: how do labor provisions in PTAs change? How much change should we expect to see every time a new PTA is negotiated? Because the promotion of labor protection in PTAs is usually seen as a tug-of-war between opposed domestic interests, one could think of strong labor protection in trade deals as a sign of weakness of exporters and strength of import-competing interests. However, I argue that the strength of labor clauses can be causally linked to the strength of exporters’ mobilization. I theorize that the more successful exporters are in their push for ambitious trade deals the greater the counter-mobilization of fair trade groups. That will lead to stronger labor protection in PTAs depending on the autonomy of the negotiator and on its bargaining power. I test that argument on the EU-Chile, EU-Colombia, US-Chile and US-Colombia cases using the method of process-tracing. This paper contributes to the literature on trade-labor linkage, lobbying and delegation.	Rodrigo Cezar

Globalization, Organized Labor, and Wage-Bargaining Institutions	One of the enduring questions in political economy is how capital and labor divide economic gains. Recent debates about the 1% vs. 99% and income inequality suggest an increasingly unfavorable economic split for labor. Yet, how capital and labor split economic gains in an increasingly global economy, and whether organized labor and wage-bargaining institutions play a role, is less well understood. Using private-sector data from 17 industrial democracies over 30 years, we demonstrate several important patterns. First, while labor compensation and corporate profits both increase in absolute terms, the ratio of compensation to profits decreases sharply, indicating a decline of the gains for labor relative to capital over the last three decades. Second, the decline of the compensation-profit ratio is associated with a rise in economic openness and a decline in union density. Third, there is a clear cross-national convergence in these patterns across corporatist and non-corporatist countries. We argue that these stylized facts point to the movement of advanced industrial democracies of all types – corporatist or not – toward a new equilibrium of global capitalism.	Erica Owen

The Politics of Openness in the Era of Global Production and Automation	As the examples of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump remind us, openness to the international economy is a choice. Democratic governments in open economies must confront a long-standing dilemma. On the one hand, when citizens hurt by globalization demand protection, governments must respond. On the other hand, governments have to guard the benefits of globalization from protectionist rhetoric and policies. Yet the increasing ability of firms to split up the production across countries or automate has altered the nature of this dilemma. Fundamentally, in a world of fragmented production and automation, workers’ welfare is delinked from the firms and industries in which they are employed. As such, policies that benefit firms may not benefit workers in those firms. How do different governments address the potential trade-off between democratic accountability and economic efficiency in the new global economy? To answer this question, I (1) examine how global production shapes interests and influence of workers relative to firms, and the consequences for the politics of openness and (2) consider empirical strategies for evaluating the influence of workers versus firms.

Exploiting the fact that water fountains, built and maintained by the political elite as private endowments, were the only means of providing drinking water to most in Ottoman Istanbul, I demonstrate that the ruling class is more likely to contribute to public goods when the system is designed to deliver exceptional benefits to the benefactors’ co-ethnic group. Using an original dataset from 1580-1800, on the spatial distribution of fountains in Istanbul and ethno-religiously segregated neighborhoods, I find a systematic relationship between the choice of fountain site and the benefactor’s own ethnic community. The finding provides a novel answer for why political elites are more willing to fund social services certain groups in authoritarian settings. This finding may be generalized to a broad range of similar cases.	Asli Cansunar

And what are the implications of such leaders for the continuation of democratic rule? In this paper, we argue that, under democratic rule, outsiders are most likely to rise to high office when political parties rely on electoral strategies emphasizing candidate charisma, rather than emphasizing coherent party brands. Parties adopt charisma focused strategies when short-term electoral considerations are prioritized over long-term success -- a situation most likely to arise in contexts characterized either by ideological polarization or electoral volatility. This reliance on the charismatic appeal of individual politicians renders political parties more dependent on their leaders, and so less able to check authoritarian backsliding, than when campaigns center on party-centric appeals. Outsiders are thus associated with backsliding and even autocratic reversion. In what follows, we formalize these intuitions. We then test (1) whether polarization and volatility are associated with outsider chief executives in democratic states; and (2) whether outsider leaders are associated with democratic backsliding, where political outsiders are defined as chief executives without prior experience in elected office.

Why did the capitalists play a significant role in some of the early democratization movements of mainly Western European countries, while they are conspicuously absent in almost all of the Third Wave countries' democratization movements? This paper argues that these two questions are closely related. As the industries in the country face increasingly more competition from potential foreign entrants (higher level of potential FDI), workers are more likely to support democratization due to the larger wage benefits from free flow of FDI under democracy, while capitalists are less likely to support democratization due to their increasing need for protection from the authoritarian regime in the form of FDI restriction. However, the effect of higher level of potential FDI on democratization prospects is ambiguous, as it does not only increase workers' incentive to revolt, but also increase the dictator's resistance to democratization due to the larger share of rents they can extract from capitalists in exchange for protection.

Aid fragmentation is widely condemned as a threat to aid effectiveness. However, empirical scholars have recently begun assessing whether fragmentation is as harmful as has been widely assumed. Though studies have shown that having more donors is negatively associated with bureaucratic quality and economic growth, more recent work suggests it can have beneficial effects when it comes to promoting child survival or democracy, and can reduce the risk for political destabilization. This paper attempts to reconcile some of these seemingly contradictory effects by investigating the relationship between aid fragmentation and progress towards achieving a variety of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using cross-national data on most developing countries from 1995 to 2013 and subnational data for selected countries, we show that aid fragmentation is beneficial for the achievement of SDG targets for which policy solutions are relatively uncontroversial (such as immunization). However, fragmentation’s benefits disappear when it comes to goals whose solutions tend to be politicized (e.g., HIV/AIDS).	Sebastian Ziaja

Scholars and practitioners agree that effective political institutions play an important role in development, and large amounts of foreign aid are given with the goal of establishing and strengthening such institutions in recipient countries. However, the volatility of aid flows can hurt the very same institutional development they are meant to promote. Both unpredictability and variability in aid flows are harmful to institutions because they hinder long-term planning, bring about undesirable dynamics such as within-institution boom-and-bust cycles, and undermine the creation, survival, and development of stable, future-oriented institutions. I analyze aid unpredictability and variability in terms of fluctuations in total dollar amounts; difference between committed and disbursed amounts; but also in terms of source, sector, and type. Through a time-series approach I show that, over the course of decades, foreign aid volatility has increased; and that uncertainty and variability in aid flows is followed by stagnation or worsening of quality of governance and institutions in recipient countries.

We combine these cross-national results with a case study of corruption in China to derive preliminary hypotheses about the political and economic factors leading to divergence or convergence between expert and popular assessments, as well as offer suggestions for how to better ascertain when perception-based measures of corruption are likely to mislead.

While such state failures might be unsurprising in low state capacity contexts, their persistence is puzzling in highly industrialized societies with democratic institutions. Two prominent examples are the Italian mafias and the yakuza in Japan. Why do mafias persist? We present a model of crime, corruption, and political transitions, which provides a unified framework for studying the impact of economic and political factors on the persistence of mafias. A key finding is that societies can sometimes be caught in 'crime traps' where law enforcement paradoxically increases crime. We embed this illegal sector equilibrium into a two-period model of policy-making with stochastic political transitions. According to the model, societies in crime traps that have dominant parties are more likely to have stronger mafias because dominant-party incumbents have an incentive to collude with the criminal sector and use law enforcement to consolidate that sector into a small number of powerful criminal organizations.

Sellers in black markets face two problems largely absent from licit markets. First, they have no legal recourse if their product is forcibly stolen from them. Second, attempts at exchange may be punished by the authorities. In a simple model of monopolistic pricing, we show these forces interact to produce increased theft as prohibition enforcement increases. More broadly, we build a typology of exchange under anarchy, generalizing the standard model of monopoly under incomplete information (Maskin and Riley 1984) to settings featuring prohibition and theft.

Is their dominant strategy to offset the loss by diversifying their portfolio or will they try to conquer others’ businesses with the risk of causing a conflict? This paper aims to tackle this question by studying the effect of the US legalisation of Marijuana on the business model of Mexican Cartels. Specifically, we exploit a unique dataset on the presence of each Mexican Cartel in each US State and we combine it with precise information about the Cartels’ presence, type and level of violence in Mexican Municipalities. Our estimates exploit the staggered nature of pot legalisation in different US States. We employ a Difference in Differences strategy to retrieve the causal effect of this “business shock” on the level of violence and electoral results in Mexican municipalities.	Nicola Mastrorocco

In particular, criminal organizations seek to cultivate a close connection to the political world to distort public policies to their advantage and bend rules and regulations restricting their ability to make profits in the legal economy. Despite these clear economic benefits, there is substantial variation in patterns of criminal infiltration of local governments in areas where criminal organizations are present. We seek to explain the determinants of infiltration in the context of Italian municipalities and we argue that it is driven by the variation across municipalities in economic benefits that criminal organizations can expect to extract following infiltration. We test our theoretical model using a difference-in-differences design that exploits exogenous shocks in economic opportunities due to post-earthquake relief, we show that criminal organizations are more likely to attempt and succeed in infiltrating municipalities that offer better economic opportunities. Moreover, as the potential economic benefit increases, criminal organizations use less and less what is commonly thought to be their main tool, violence against politicians.	Livio Di Lonardo

However, established measures of congruence are often limited to a unidimensional political space, while recent theoretical contributions stress the importance of multidimensionality in congruence. I extend the typology of Golder \& Stramski (2010) to the multidimensional case and introduce a novel approach to estimating the many to many congruence under these conditions. Drawing on an online survey prior to the European Parliamentary elections of 2014, I jointly scale voters and parties and assess the level of multidimensional congruence across 27 European states. This approach is of interest to those studying representational congruence, while the application highlights the variance in congruence across EU states.	Garret Binding

Using gender quotas as example for an explicitly formulated ambition, we break new ground for the disentangled analysis of selection and election processes to show how key factors explain the size of this gap. We argue that the extent to which representative ambitions can be translated into electoral outcomes depends inter alia on the control of party elites over the selection as well as the election process. Using new detailed individual level data from all (N= ~40.000) candidates and elected MPs in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland (1982 - 2017) we first explain how gender quotas translate into selected candidates.

We report findings from a 2018 study conducted in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. We set up repeated communications between 14,400 voters and 20 randomly selected members of the provincial assembly (MPAs) using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology. Politicians scripted and recorded questions they deemed important to send out to a random sample of voters. We disseminated the recordings to voters' cell phones and aggregated responses. Politicians were then allowed to engage with voters with another phone call. Following the June 2018 election, we collected endline data. Our design allows us to study whether IVR calls changed polling station level outcomes (vote shares and turnout,) as well as whether politicians changed their efforts in targeted areas. It also allows us to disentangle effects on voters of getting a call from the incumbent from effects of asking for input into policy decisions. We compare outcomes in the constituencies of the 20 treated politicians with those for 20 control politicians.	Miriam Golden

We use an experiment manipulating voters’ perceptions of representation in order to identify their causal effect on populist sentiment on representative samples from 12 European countries (n = 24000). Respondents are first asked to state their preference on two EU policy issues. Next, they read a vignette about how major parties have sorted themselves on it during the European elections, which can indicate either that at least one party has taken the respondent’s position on that issue, or that no party has done so. We also vary whether parties have all taken the same position, or if they assumed different views from each other, and follow with questions on populist attitudes. These treatments affect representation in two ways: a) parties hold diverse positions, and b) at least one party advocates a position close to the respondent's.

Examining young people’s partisan socialisation within the home.	The past three decades have seen a dramatic decline in the proportion of people with a party identity. This decline primarily results from new cohorts who have lower levels of party identity than their predecessors. Once a cohort enters the electorate, levels of identification remain stable. These findings point to the importance of early experiences in shaping voters’ partisanship. This paper examines young people’s weakening attachments to parties, asking whether changes in socialisation can explain partisan dealignment. We use data on 11-15 year olds in the British Household Panel Study/Understanding Society (a household panel study spanning 26 years) to test demand-side explanations of dealignment among young people. Has increased female education and employment changed the socialisation of young people, due to different socialisation pressures in both workplaces? Did increased enrolment in higher education over that time period affect the expectations young people had for their future? Does declining sibship size also reduce political socialisation within the home? And is there a ratchet effect, where less partisan previous generations further fail to indoctrinate their children into a party identity?	Nicole Martin

Has increased female education and employment changed the socialisation of young people, due to different socialisation pressures in both workplaces? Did increased enrolment in higher education over that time period affect the expectations young people had for their future? Does declining sibship size also reduce political socialisation within the home? And is there a ratchet effect, where less partisan previous generations further fail to indoctrinate their children into a party identity?	Nicole Martin

We use a new three-wave survey of the UK public to examine the extent to which citizens (a) hold real opinions – measured in terms of response stability – on each of 34 policy issues and (b) make stable multidimensional choices between candidates based on issue positions in conjoint experiments. We find that the stability of issue-specific opinion varies widely across issues, but that a number of issues exhibit high levels of stability that are comparable to canonical benchmarks such as party identification in the United States. We also find that citizens tend to put more weight on higher-stability issues when choosing between candidates and that their conjoint responses exhibit high stability over time.

In contrast, the Republican Party is characterized primarily by fealty to conservative ideological symbolism. Research shows that Democrats’ programmatic policy appeals engender greater attitudinal consistency among party elites and mass public identifiers, whereas Republicans often disconnect conservative ideological attachments from more liberal issue attitudes. In this paper, we propose and test a theory linking political sophistication to attitudes toward group-specific policy proposals designed to benefit particular social groups, namely African Americans, homosexuals and the poor. We expect that political sophistication increases Democrats’ support for group-specific policies, as greater awareness should foster non-group members’ willingness to help the party’s constituent groups and further the core value of equality. We expect that political sophistication will play no demonstrable moderating role in this relationship among Republicans because GOP principles do not demand accommodating group-based interests.

When some voters have nonseparable preferences, a candidate may move from a losing position to a winning position by moving further from the majority of voters in the policy space. Empirical studies of issue voting in elections will mispredict voter behavior when voter preferences are nonseparable. Data from 2004, 2012, and 2016 panel studies during US presidential elections show that a substantial percentage of voters have nonseparable preferences for many issues in the elections. A vote choice model that includes measures of nonseparable preferences and generalized Euclidean issue distances better explains the vote than a model with simple Euclidean issue distances.	Dean Lacy

Yet, theories of expressive voting suggest that voters can also derive intrinsic value from the very act of expressing support for a party that they identify with. Despite the burgeoning scholarly attention to the contrast between instrumental and expressive voting, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize and operationalize expressive voting. In this paper, we contribute to this literature by conceptualizing and measuring expressive voting explicitly as social identity-based. We argue that social identities shape vote choice even when voters are given information and incentives to vote instrumentally. We test this argument in a laboratory setting, using a version of the minimal group paradigm to unpack how group-identities shape voting. Our findings show that while individuals do vote instrumentally, even very weakly induced identities have a very powerful impact on vote choices.	Toni Rodon

Advocates argue that IRV reduces voters' incentive to vote strategically compared to plurality, but that claim has never been rigorously assessed. Using new methods for calculating the probability of pivotal events in IRV elections and preference data from 160 election surveys, we show that (i) the proportion of voters with a positive incentive to vote insincerely is higher in IRV than in plurality but (ii) fewer voters have a substantial incentive to vote insincerely. We also show that IRV is more likely than plurality to choose the Condorcet Winner not just when voters vote sincerely (as is well known) but also when as many as half of them cast a myopic strategic vote.

However, empirical evidence mainly stems from single case studies and we have comparatively little evidence of the usability of such models across contexts. I use copulas and the concept of choice sets to develop a sequential, two-staged choice model in order to gain insight into the political decision making of voters. Voters only take information on vote choices into account if multiple alternatives remain. The model allows for both optimizing behavior and decisions that are only marginally rational. I formalize the model and apply it to data from the European Election Survey (EES) 2014. Thereby, we will gain detailed insight into the political decision making process of voters.	Thomas Willi

The effect of short-term letting on electoral behaviour	Over the last few years, short-term lets or home sharing have radically changed the dynamics of mass tourism. In addition, the short-term holiday letting industry has also had profound consequences, positive or negative, in many urban spaces. Thus, short-term lets have been lucrative for some, but they have also changed many city's urban spaces and transformed the character of different areas, leading to evictions or displacing neighbours to the suburbs. While previous works have focused on the economic effect of short-term letting, much less is known about the electoral effects of the “Airbnb” phenomenon. Does it lead to a higher propensity to vote for certain parties, especially for those that own the issue? Does it lead voters to punish the incumbent? Or does it increase abstention? Using detailed geographic data on Airbnb locations in several Spanish cities and a difference-in-differences design, this article examines the effect of short-term letting on electoral behaviour. This study has important implications for our understanding of the interplay between urban management, social cohesion and vote choice.	Toni Rodon

Using panel data with individuals' vote choices and racial identities recorded around the last two US presidential election periods, this paper demonstrates a strong relationship between vote switching patterns and racial identification change. Specifically, across several models and robust to various controls, switching into a 2016 Republican vote (i.e., non-Romney to Trump vote) significantly predicts nonwhite to white race change. For example, among original nonwhites who didn't vote Republican in 2012, switching to a Republican vote in 2016 doubles the probability of switching to a white racial identity. This systematic relationship cannot be ascribed to measurement error and makes theoretical sense in light of 2016 election candidate rhetoric and broader trends in political-social identity alignment.

To better understand the processes through which politicians interfere with the production of economic statistics, this article thus pursues an in-depth qualitative examination of three recent high-profile cases: Greece’s entry into the EMU, controversies about Argentina’s inflation statistics in the late 2000s, and the Brazilian “fiscal pedaling” scandal of 2014-15. We make two main contributions: First, we suggest drawing a distinction among four different types of manipulation - outright manipulation, politically motivated guesstimating, the opportunistic use of methodology space, and the strategic management of financial flows. Second, our case studies indicate that the political manipulation of economic statistics generally represents a strategy, which is high-risk, hard to implement and questionably successful. Overall, this leads us to somewhat more optimistic conclusions with regard to the integrity of official statistics.	Roberto Barbosa de Andrade Aragão, Lukas Linsi

Why are ballot initiatives, a form of direct democracy, ever necessary in representative systems? While previous research focuses on the (causal) impact of various factors on initiative success, this paper addresses why such policymaking openings should ever exist in the first place. To answer this puzzle, we must shift our attention away from the differences between successful and unsuccessful initiatives and consider why legislators fail to respond to 'the people's' will. Using contributor-level ideological scores, this paper demonstrates that ideological support for successful initiatives tends to be more extreme than support for successful legislative candidates, while substantive correlations between party and initiative vote choice remain. Moreover, computing legislators' ideal behaviour using constituency-level vote breakdowns suggests that divergences between legislative and electoral preferences are not the result of mis-aggregation across districts. Legislators simply do not always act on the preferences of their district median voter. This paper contributes to a growing debate about representation and responsiveness in advanced democracies, and the use of direct democratic policymaking more broadly.	Thomas Robinson

The few existing studies on the effects of foreign interventions on public opinion and voting focus on democracy promotion and arrive at mixed conclusions. Others study national media endorsements specifically and find positive effects. This paper investigates whether different nationalities of the intervening authorities increase or decrease the probability of a negative (reactant) reaction. We conduct a survey experiment using a political endorsement. The treatment consists of manipulating the nationality of the endorsing authority. We test three competing hypotheses: (1) the reactant reactions to endorsements coming from historical ‘ally’ nationalities are weaker than those to the ‘enemy’ nationalities; (2) the backlash is similarly strong to all foreign advice – which would mean that it is aimed at all cosmopolitan elites; (3) the backlash is similarly strong to all advice, including national advice – i.e. it is aimed at all elites. Additionally, we explore whether different nationalities trigger mechanisms such as insecurity or nationalism, and whether the reactant reaction is moderated by the exogenous factor of living close to the country’s border.

Building on models of retrospective voting, one should expect the incumbent to be harmed by voters’ exposure to terrorist violence. However, previous studies have identified “rallies around the flag” that are common in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. This mechanism might counterbalance retrospective voting by diluting clarity of responsibility and therefore terrorism constitutes a hard case for accountability. Empirically, we rely on time series cross-sectional data on ETA deadly attacks and election results of the national incumbent in Spanish municipalities during the period 1977-2011. Using municipality- and year- fixed effects models to control for various sources of heterogeneity, we find that the electoral losses of the incumbent substantially increase with proximity to terror attacks, although the effect is non-linear: the negative impact for the incumbent vanishes for medium levels of distance. The effect is stronger for attacks with a large deathtoll and weaker, if not absent, when victims are not civilians. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the functioning of democracies subject to terrorist violence.	Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Jordi Muñoz

Political polarization and the rising nationalism are shaping western-European political systems. This paper analyses the consequences of different typologies of violence displayed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) on voting behavior during the democratic period (1981-) in the Basque Country. The empirical strategy is two-fold. First, unpublished geographically located data on aerial bombings and civilian deaths executed during the civil war at the municipal-level is employed to analyze voting behavior in municipal elections in Biscay during the democratic period. Second, this research uses survey data to uncover the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of the legacy of violence. Preliminary results show that these municipalities bombed by the Francoist army (1937) present a consistent margin in favor of Basque nationalist parties in local elections. Placebo tests using the Second Republic (1931-1936) elections results do not find this trend. Alternatively, survey data proposes respondent's permanence at antecedents' birthplace as the clearest mechanism of intergenerational transmission of the legacy of violence.	Sergi Martínez

Empirically, we exploit plausible exogenous variation in the exposure to the 2016 Berlin attack in two nationally representative surveys covering multiple European countries. We find no evidence for a populist response to the terrorist attack in any of the surveyed countries. On the contrary, people in Germany became more positive towards the EU in the wake of the Berlin attack. Moreover, we find little evidence that ideology shaped the response to the attack. Our findings suggest that terrorist attacks in the short term are not met by a public populist response.	Erik Gahner Larsen

The effect of intra- and intergenerational social mobility on support for social-democratic parties in the UK, Germany, and Switzerland	This paper investigates how intra- and intergenerational social mobility affect support for social-democratic parties, focussing on the traditional and new strongholds of the left: production and service workers, and socio-cultural professionals. We expect the intergenerational transmission of class identity and party identification to play an important role in promoting social-democratic party support; and that changes and instability in the own occupational status over the life course can lead to volatility and demobilisation of (former) social-democratic voters. We investigate these hypotheses with longitudinal models, using household panel data from three countries (UK, Germany, Switzerland). The findings indicate that while father’s social-democratic party identity is an important predictor, intergenerational class mobility does not affect social-democratic party support, as class of destination is more important than class of origin. Moreover, in terms of intragenerational changes, workers who have experienced downward social mobility over the life course are more likely to support social-democratic parties than their immobile peers. These findings indicate that individual life-course changes are more influential than the class of origin in explaining these classes’ social-democratic party support.	Mathilde van Ditmars

A panel study of the mechanisms connecting class and support for redistribution.	The connection between class and political preferences is among the most well-established in the social sciences. This association has often been taken as prima facie evidence of an economic self-interest mechanism. Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because they have different (economic) interests. However, class differences do not only reflect material interests, but also the residues of much earlier socialization as well as workplace characteristics.

The paper discusses the nature of the electorates’ perceptions towards women leadership and the effects of the perceptions on performance of women parliamentary candidates in Malawi. The paper also uncovers the roots of the perceptions that are held towards female leaders. The paper draws from empirical evidence generated through qualitative design. The paper uses Zomba district as a case-study and focuses on two constituencies namely: Changalume and Zomba Central Constituency. The paper establishes that Malawians hold negative perceptions towards women leaders and these perceptions influence their choice of candidate when voting resulting into preference of a male candidate. Due to the negative perceptions that the electorates hold towards women leaders, the electorates would rather vote for male candidates than female candidates. The paper established four main perceptions that electorates have towards women leaders which are: women have low thinking capacity and poor decision-making skills, women are conforming and dependent,women are emotional and lastly women are more concerned with personal lives and are supposed to be home makers. The paper reveals culture and religion as the sources of these perceptions.	Samantha Soyiyo

Female representation has increased over the last decades, but women in politics, especially in high-profile political positions, are still underrepresented. In many countries, the increase of women in high-profile political positions is slower than expected. The literature exploring the relationship between perceptions of suitability for politics and women underrepresentation is few and vague. Are cultural barriers still present? How they interfere with perceptions of suitability for politics? By way of Goldberg Paradigm, I tested differences in attitudes towards male and female legislators in Ireland and I showed that men are perceived as more suitable legislators than women while there is a lack of trust in actual career chances for women. Comparing this result with a vignette experiment triggering gender issue, I found that when the interest for gender is revealed, suitability scores are affected and women show support for women politicians. On the contrary, they support men when the interest for gender is hidden. The result shows that cultural barriers still prevent women access to politics, especially in high-profile positions.

Specifically, how did gender factor into the 2016 United State presidential election? Popular and scholarly accounts of the 2016 election have focused mainly other considerations to explain support for the U.S. presidential candidates. We argue, and find, that gender attitudes matter a great deal, but that their effects turn less on candidate sex than on a variety of specific gender-relevant characteristics of the candidates, including inhabiting or rejecting traditional gender roles, embracing or dismissing sexism as a problem in society, and exhibiting positive or negative affect toward women as a group. During the 2016 election primary, we asked a sample of U.S. citizens how they felt about all of the leading remaining candidates. We also measured three different types of gender attitudes among survey respondents. In our analyses, we probe the sources of citizens’ preferences in real election match-ups, contrasting those with hypothetical match-ups.

Evidence from Local Elections in California, 1995-2016	Research demonstrates that many voters use gender stereotypes to evaluate candidates, but does that stereotyping affect women’s electoral success? In this paper, we try to make headway in answering that question by combining a novel empirical strategy with subnational election data from California. Our empirical strategy relies on two existing findings: first, that individuals are more likely to rely on stereotypes when they have less information about the candidates, and second, that the average voter in elections held concurrently with national elections has less information about local candidates than the average voter in off-cycle elections. We propose that we can therefore estimate the electoral effect of increased gender stereotyping by examining the difference in women’s win rates in higher-information (off-cycle) and lower-information (on-cycle) elections—and how that difference varies by constituency and the office sought. Our results show evidence of stereotype-consistent behaviors during on-cycle (low-information) races. We conclude that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how gender stereotyping affects female candidates, but rather that the direction and magnitude of the effect varies across institutional contexts.

The global spread of electoral gender quotas has been characterized as one of the most significant political developments of the last 30 years. The adoption of quotas has presented a puzzle to researchers given that many of the countries that have adopted these laws are (semi-)authoritarian countries that have otherwise-stark gender inequalities. Many scholars argue that such countries adopt gender quotas as a strategy for improving their international reputations. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored whether countries’ reputations actually do improve after quota adoption. This paper answers that question with evidence from large-scale survey experiments in both Sweden and the United States. The evidence suggests that respondents are more likely to support giving authoritarian countries foreign aid and perceive such countries as democratic when women’s descriptive representation is stronger. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of quotas, this paper also contributes to broader literatures on human rights and attitudes about foreign aid.	Sarah Bush

Prime ministers in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) are commonly perceived to be weaker than their Western European colleagues. This assessment relies on their comparatively shorter survival in office. However, the post-communist legacy of CEE provides a more favourable context for prime ministers to personally influence voting behaviour in parliamentary elections. I argue that the party system as well as the comparatively higher influence of elites over the media provide prime ministers in CEE with greater electoral potential than their West European counterparts. I study the leader effect of prime ministers across European countries to test this hypothesis using CSES data. I find that prime ministers in CEE have a stronger influence on vote choice than West European prime ministers. This presents a puzzle since prime ministers in CEE seem unable to use their comparatively higher electoral strength to secure their position in office. I discuss the implications of this finding for the presidentialization thesis and the survival of prime ministers.	Jan Berz

In contrast, indirect presidential elections – the selection of a republication head of state without immediate public involvement – have been almost systematically neglected by the literature. Most prominently, the literature on electoral systems identifies up to five different categories of direct presidential elections, whereas indirect presidential elections are compressed into just one (if they are discussed at all). The aim of this paper is to provide a first comprehensive comparative examination of the rules governing indirect presidential elections in democracies around the world. Therefore, it proposes a new classification of indirect presidential elections based on (1) selectorate composition, (2) majority requirements and (3) finality of the vote. A systematic assessment of original data on electoral rules since 1945 demonstrates that formulae for indirect presidential elections are far more complex than suggested by the existing literature and more varied than those governing popular contests. The results call for a re-examination of the current scholarship on presidential elections and the adoption of indirect elections into the canon of electoral studies.	Philipp Köker

In this way, systemic corruption can serve as a second-best substitute for genuine property rights and aid economic growth. In this paper, we undertake a cross-country empirical analysis of this hypothesis. The key consideration is the extent to which a political-economic system combines high levels of corruption, weak formal property rights, and otherwise growth oriented policies allowing substantial private investor participation in the economy.

However, previous studies have not analyzed the effect of public decisions that involve a direct trade-off between honesty and efficiency. We put this hypothesis to a direct test through an experimental moral dilemma that clearly reflects this trade-off. In this experiment—included in a representative survey of the Spanish population—we examine participants’ evaluations and likelihood of voting for a politician that faces a moral dilemma in a public bidding process in which being corrupt leads to the most efficient outcome. In this dilemma the politician can either adopt a decision that does not follow the established legal procedure but leads to the optimal and welfare enhancing outcome, or she can adopt a decision that, even if it leads to a suboptimal outcome, follows the appropriate legal procedure.

Can the institution also create a new aristocracy, enabling their survival under democratisation? This paper studies the evolution of dynastic links in the early years of the Dutch bicameral parliament. The peculiar circumstances of the creation of a bicameral legislature in 1815 allow us to assess the role of a senate in the evolution of dynasties in politics. After a long period of republican government, a national aristocracy was created and representatives were appointed to the senate by the king. These senators received the honour of being appointed to an upper chamber, in a legislature firmly controlled by the king with few actual powers for either chamber. Otherwise comparable political elites, whose representatives were indirectly elected to the House instead, form the control group. A difference-in-difference analysis confirms that the junior relatives of pre-democracy appointed senators were more likely to start or continue the dynasty than the relatives of the indirectly elected legislators. Senates can encourage democratic capture: The recently created aristocracy survived democratization in the elected lower chamber for some time.	Brenda Van Coppenolle

Some scholars have suggested that dealignment should produce greater incentives for personal vote-seeking, by weakening party cues and making citizens more attentive to the qualities of individual legislators. However, existing empirical tests of this claim reach mixed conclusions. This paper thus provides a new test of this argument, asking whether the relationship between MPs’ parliamentary activity and their popularity is conditional on voters’ partisanship. I present the results of two complementary analyses. The first is a survey experiment, which manipulates respondents’ perception of an MP’s activity. The second is a quasi-experiment, exploiting the use of a random ballot in granting New Zealand MPs the right to introduce legislation. Both analyses suggest that more active MPs are more popular with voters. However, as expected, this relationship is moderated by voters’ partisanship. MPs’ parliamentary behaviour chiefly affects the evaluations of voters with the weakest partisanship. This supports the argument that partisan dealignment heightens politicians’ incentives for personal vote-seeking,	Thomas Fleming

Highlights from the Italian Chamber of Deputies.	Candidate-centered electoral systems incentivize politicians to cultivate a Personal Vote. Conventional wisdom on electoral systems and elected representatives’ behaviour tells us that the construction of a Personal Vote incentivizes Political Particularism. However, studies showing a direct connection between the construction of a Personal Vote and Political Particularism, using data on votes by candidates and candidates’ personal attributes, are still quite rare. In this analysis, I concentrate on Post-war Italy, whereby a candidate-centered open-list PR system was used to elect representatives to the Chamber of Deputies. In this context, 1) I produce an extensive data-set on Italian proposed legislation, Deputies’ personal characteristics and preference votes; 2) I build and validate four new dictionaries of Italian Political Particularism, that I use to code the newly-collected bill proposals; 3)I employ data on the preference votes gained by each Deputy to unpack the causal mechanism linking the construction of a Personal Vote to the promotion of particularistic policy-making. Results show that, irrespective of personal characteristics, party affiliation and ideology, legislators who constructed a large Personal Vote are more willing to propose particularistic legislation.

Explaining Voter Discrimination against Immigrant-Origin Candidates	An emerging body of research suggests that discrimination against candidates with a migration background is prevalent across Europe, in particular among voters of right-wing parties. Why do some voters discriminate against candidates with a migration background? As an explanation, I consider voters who attribute negative stereotypes to immigrant-origin candidates, whereby I differentiate between trait stereotypes and stereotypes that depict said candidates as 'non-citizens.' While trait stereotypes, particularly beliefs about competence and warmth, have been influential to explain voter discrimination against other disadvantaged groups such as women or racial minorities, the second stereotype targets candidates with a migration background more specifically. In this latter explanation, voters reject immigrant-origin candidates as democratic co-citizens and attribute to them that they do not live up the nation's civic culture. To test these stereotypes, I rely on an original moderation-of-process survey experiment fielded in France and Italy, two countries that differ regarding attitudes towards immigrants and the perception of civic citizenship in the population.

Using large-N survey data, I employ an in-group versus out-group framework and a more well-rounded indicator which incorporates data on racial resentment, feeling thermometer, and racial stereotypes in two models to assess attitudes toward whites, blacks, and Hispanics in the first, and the addition of Asian-Americans in the second. I posit that the segments of the electorate who exhibited salient and negative racial attitudes would not have voted for the Democratic candidate, so their effect on the election was minimal at best.

Experimental Tests from 19 European Societies	Authoritarian predispositions and contextual threats are both thought to produce intolerance and prejudice towards immigrants and other minorities. Yet there is considerable dispute as to how authoritarianism and threats interact to produce an 'authoritarian dynamic.' Some scholars argue that threats increase intolerance by 'galvanizing' authoritarians. Others claim that authoritarians are always intolerant toward outgroups, with threat instead 'mobilizing' non-authoritarians. Using experimental manipulations of immigrant cultural threat embedded in nationally-representative samples from 19 European societies, this study offers a dispositive test of these competing hypotheses. While we find some evidence for the 'galvanizing' hypothesis, we find no evidence for the 'mobilizing' hypothesis. The effects vary considerably across national samples however, with immigrants from Muslim societies being particularly likely to activate authoritarian predispositions. These findings show how the migration of culturally distinctive groups has the potential to activate authoritarian dispositions, thereby pushing the issue of immigration to the center of political debates.

Although some countries expressly prohibit dual citizens from holding public office, many do not. In countries without explicit bans on the practice, implicit biases among the electorate toward candidates with dual citizenship may still function as electoral barriers, particularly during periods of heightened nationalism. I examine this question using a conjoint survey experiment in which respondents choose between hypothetical pairs of candidates who vary randomly across personal attributes, including citizenship status. I find that political candidates who hold dual citizenship are not only less likely to be selected than their single citizenship counterparts, but that some dual citizenship candidates experience a larger electoral penalty than others. While these results shed light on the relationship between citizenship and electoral performance, they also speak to broader trends in Islamophobia and Antisemitism across the United States and Europe.

One of the alleged implications is that these decisions might be increasingly driven by the personal appeal of politicians at the expense of rational political reasoning. However, other strand of research suggests that voters might use personality traits as a shortcut to infer political information, essential to vote. This study tackles this issue by assessing whether candidates’ personality traits have an effect on voter’ decision making, and if so, whether this effect is cancelled out when political information is also available. Moreover, the study explores which candidates’ personality traits matter for voters, both when political cues are available and when they are not. The research design relies on a varying-conjoint experiment embedded in an original survey with 1,200 Spanish citizens. Results suggest that, in personalized contexts, voters’ decisions may not only be political, but that elections are at least partly a personality contest. This implies that traditional models of voting behavior should incorporate personality in the context of personalized politics.	Alberto López Ortega

Evidence from Self-Reported Depression and Political Perceptions in Spain	Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and among the most common mental health issues. Research on cognition and depression demonstrates that depressed individuals filter information and respond to stimuli in a negative way that is consistent with their idiosyncratic beliefs and assumptions. On the other hand, research on depression and political attitudes shows that depressed persons are on average more likely to identify with left parties, but leaves the question on what kind of party image would prevail (i.e. the affective-emotional or the policy-rational) open. This introduces a tension between how depressed persons perceive policy problems and how they structure their party choice. By using data from a new survey on political attitudes in Spain, we assess whether individuals with depressive symptoms have different perceptions on policy problems and whether issue ownership theory works as a mechanism of party choice. Our paper improves our understanding of how mental health shapes political perceptions.	Luca Bernardi

A dominant theory is that these self-proclaimed independents are merely covert partisans. In the largest functional brain imaging study of neuropolitics to date, we find differences between partisans and nonpartisans in the posterior medial cortices, a portion of the brain’s Default Mode Network implicated in both our sense of self as well social cognition. These results suggest that rather than being mere covert partisans, nonpartisans process the world in a way that is distinct from their partisan counterparts.	Darren Schreiber

We conceptualize the self as a 'tank'' filled with different inputs. One type of input is purely individuating characteristics, e.g., 'I am punctual.' Another derives from group affiliations, e.g., 'I'm a Democrat.' We theorize that these components of the self operate as a hydraulic system; when traits are made salient, group affiliations become less relevant. We test this expectation by experimentally manipulating the salience of traits. We supplement the experiment with a panel survey that captures naturally occurring variation in the salience of individuals' partisanship. Wave 1 occurred during the week of the 2018 mid-terms, and Wave 2 was fielded over the Christmas break. We anticipate that partisanship contributes more to the self than traits at Wave 1. We assess the impact of the experimental manipulation and naturally occurring changes in the political context on two sets of measures. First, we consider participants' ratings of their ideological and partisan identity. Second, we consider their evaluations of major party leaders.	Shanto Iyengar

At present, much of what we understand about policy formation focuses on issue emphasis, issue salience, and political parties responding to external issue preferences. Fundamental explanations of legislator and party behavior do little to explain exactly what motivates intra-party issue adoption and what factors result in raising an issue’s salience to prominence. This work fills a gap in the party politics literature by analyzing a moment far earlier in the agenda setting process – first, what motivates individual politicians to take up new issues, then push those issues onto their party’s agenda, and lobby for legislation. Using a major legislation case in the UK (the National Minimum Wage Act of 1998), I scrape issue mentions from parliamentary institutions (written PQs and floor speeches) combined with public opinion data to study the effect of emphasis on issue raising and policy-making. Following a detailed analysis of the legislation's formation, I find that successful issue adoption stems from a combination of intra-party lobbying as well as public pressure.	Christine Sylvester

When niche parties can successfully argue that governments are ignoring their issues (especially when these issues are potentially salient among the public) then their anti-establishment appeal will be more credible and help them attract voters. Hence, ceteris paribus party agendas and government agendas should affect niche party fortunes in opposite ways. We empirically test these expectations combining data on both government agendas and party agendas from the Comparative Agendas Project with individual level data from the European Social Survey.

We illustrate both types of potential career movement with electoral data for the UK Parliament and for Brazilian state legislatures. For the UK, we find that runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected in a different parliamentary constituency in the following electoral cycle. Among Brazilian state legislators, runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected for other posts (local councillor and mayor). Ignoring this phenomenon would lead to an overestimate of the overall advantage of being the winner.	Salomo Hirvonen

For the UK, we find that runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected in a different parliamentary constituency in the following electoral cycle. Among Brazilian state legislators, runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected for other posts (local councillor and mayor). Ignoring this phenomenon would lead to an overestimate of the overall advantage of being the winner.	Salomo Hirvonen

In 11 out of 14 offices from 10 different countries the RDD estimate of party incumbency advantage is higher in samples restricted to constituencies where a party had a negative winning margin in previous election compared to the whole sample or constituencies where the party has been winning. In order to show that this is not driven by period specific shocks, different measures of past party performance are used. This result holds at the candidate level for US Mayor and Gubernatorial elections. Thus, it is consistent with a model where a candidate running in an opposing party stronghold must have a valency advantage in order to get into a close election sample and valency is positively correlated with incumbency advantage. As typically election districts are not distributed symmetrically in terms of party vote shares, it contributes to the magnitude of incumbency estimates. Moreover this 'sample selection' serves as a test for the relationship between valency advantage and incumbency advantage.	Salomo Hirvonen

We argue that incumbents are less likely to benefit from holding office when list competitors are well-known and of high quality. To test this mechanism, we exploit the special 'dual mandate' characteristic of Irish local elections. Until 1999, members of the national parliament (TDs) were allowed to be represented in local and national parliaments simultaneously. By applying the regression discontinuity design to local elections between 1942 and 2014, we demonstrate that marginally elected politicians perform significantly worse when a TD competes for votes on the same list. Moreover, the incumbency advantage has become larger after the dual mandate was abolished. Our results highlight the moderating impact of high-quality competitors on the incumbency bonus.

Local Incumbency and Performance in General Elections	We would expect political parties to benefit electorally from their control over local governments in general elections unless their performance in the local government is perceived as markedly negative by voters. One way to empirically analyze the impact of local incumbency on general elections is to employ RDD (regression discontinuity). However, the fact that boundaries of electoral districts in local elections differ most of the time from general elections’ complicates the analysis, especially if electoral mobilization can be targeted to competitive districts. By using data from Turkey where four different general elections with three different aggregation rules took place following the 2014 local elections, I try to disentangle the effect of electoral competitiveness at different levels on parties’ mobilization strategies and, in turn, on general election results. As expected, I find that local incumbency’s effect depends on the competitiveness of the general elections at the level in which votes are aggregated and turned into seats.	Ozge Kemahlioglu

While some populist leaders focus on economic issues, others focus largely on cultural issues. Yet despite their substantive differences, populists share a personalistic style and attempt to subordinate institutions to their wills. To retain personal legitimacy, we argue that populists will take extra measures to ensure that economic performance remains strong while they are in office. Consequently, they will be more willing than other democratically-elected leaders to attack institutions like independent central banks which may restrain growth and will increase the debt burden on the country to fuel growth. But while these policies have a positive short-run impact on growth, they have a negative long-run impact. Therefore we expect that economic growth under populist leadership will be more volatile than under non-populist leadership. Limiting our focus to democracies and drawing on a new database of 46 populist leaders from around the world from 1990-2016, we find that populist leaders are associated with greater reductions in central bank independence, higher debt growth, and more volatile economic growth than non-populist democratically-elected leaders.

While this finding is hardly contested for the late 20th and early 21st century, it might not have always been like this. Most notably, Matsusaka has shown that before WWII, cities in the US with direct democratic elements tended to have higher spending. We examine this 'Matsusaka paradox' by differentiating between the effects of direct democratic institutions allowing to block legislation and institutions enabling actors outside the legislative and executive to propose new laws. In addition, we analyse how the representative system, in which direct democracy is embedded, shapes these instruments' effect on state spending. Based on almost 200 years of fiscal and political data from Swiss cantons, we exploit the different moments of introduction as well as the varying degree to which these institutions existed to examine the effect of direct democracy on government spending.

The tax increase is a new phenomena compared to the continued corporate and personal income tax cut since 1980s as a result of the race-to-the-bottom tax competition among advanced industrial democracies. Taxing the rich becomes an important political agenda in many countries with rising inequality. This study investigates the political factors affecting the tax policies of OECD members after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Previous literature on tax competition shows that the change of tax policy is conditioned by political environments such as partisanship, veto players, consensus democracy, etc. Different from the neoliberal convergence hypothesis predicting the demise of partisan politics, we found that the government partisanship is a critical factor explaining the political logic of taxing the rich. A left-wing government is more likely to increase the personal and corporate income tax rate. However, the effect of partisan politics is significantly weaker among the high-income OECD members than among the mid-income countries.	Hyeon Seok Park

At the same time, traditional survey instruments to measure preferences are met with skepticism. Concerns are, inter alia, the risk to mistake non-attitudes for real preferences or to distort preferences through arbitrary wording choices. Also interest in the multi-dimensionality of policies has demonstrated the limitations of traditional survey items. Based on these concerns, we will study support for redistributive policies in group discussions. Such discussions are the setting in which people typically experience politics in everyday life. The design allows studying how people reason outside the constraints of pre-defined survey items, how they weight different aspects of redistributive policies and how they justify preferences. Going beyond the content of conversations, we are interested in their emotional quality. By non-obtrusively measuring the affective resonance of talking about preferences (through tools from conversation analysis and psychology of emotions), we hope to gain deeper insights into the strength of support as well as into how social contexts facilitate or constrain the expression of preferences.

Introducing different trade-offs in the measurement of social policy preferences	Most comparative surveys provide data on citizens’ positions regarding social policies and redistribution, yet these questions do not take into account that, in today’s context of constrained public budgets, it is frequently not possible to implement all desirable social policies at the same time.

In this paper, we implement and compare three kinds of measures that capture social policy priorities: conjoint experiments, rating questions, and explicit trade-off questions. These novel items are part of a survey fielded in 8 European countries, and allow us to measure how much voters value a welfare benefit, dislike a cost (or opportunity cost) and how they decide when the two are pitted against each other.

How financial crises and technocrats change (or not) the welfare state in Europe	Since the 2008 financial crises the appointments of technocrats in parliamentary cabinets has more than doubled. At the same time most European governments adopted fiscal austerity with important consequences for their welfare states. How much of this effect is due to the financial crisis and how much is it due to the specific ministerial appointments? Using data from 13 European countries since 1980 and two-stage least square models, we test the effects of financial crises and of technocratic appointments on a battery of social welfare indicators. Initial results indicate that technocrats appointed in the finance portfolio have real effects on social welfare policy, controlling for financial crises. However, these effects are not unconditional. While technocrats appointed by right of center parties are associated with large cuts in welfare and pension generosity, technocrats appointed by left parties are not. Perhaps surprisingly, experienced ministers of right of center parties with a background in economics are associated with larger cuts in government expenditure than technocrats.	Despina Alexiadou

Most party systems have seen a significant rise in polarization during the past decades. This paper shows that austerity policies significantly contributed to this development. Our analysis of 180 elections since 1980 finds that austerity and polarization are strongly related, especially if a left government implemented austerity policies. Survey experiments with a total of 8'000 respondents in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Portugal show why this is the case. If a right-wing government implements austerity, then dissatisfied voters mostly turn to the main left opposition party. If, however, a left-wing government implements austerity, then dissatisfied voters turn towards small, non-mainstream parties or abstain from voting because the right opposition does not provide a credible anti-austerity alternative. Our results disconfirm the common conjecture that left governments are punished more strongly for austerity. Government partisanship matters nonetheless because voters resort to different alternative parties under left and right governments. Austerity, thus, is not only is politically costly for governments in the short term, but it can also have profound and lasting effects on party systems through its impact on polarization.

A Cross-Country Analysis	To prevent fiscal problems or even a sovereign default, there is a simple 'medicine': cutting public expenditures and/or increasing taxes. Apart from the issue that this fiscal medicine may have adverse effects on the economy (e.g. on economic growth), there may also be adverse effects for those policymakers which have decided to implement austerity measures. The conventional wisdom says that a policy of fiscal austerity will most likely be 'punished' by citizen-voters at the ballot box. Using cross-national public opinion data, this paper investigates what citizens in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world think about this policy issue. Is fiscal austerity really so unpopular? It turns out that fiscal austerity currently is generally supported by majorities of respondents in a number of highly indebted countries. However, public support decreases significantly when citizens are asked regarding spending cuts in specific budget areas which may decrease their current standard of living. This leaves policymakers under fiscal pressure with the crucial issue of how to cope with this striking paradox of 'Austerity yes, but not in my backyard'.	Karsten Mause

How victimization shapes preferences for public goods provision in Liberia	Citizens who have experienced civil conflict are often victims of both conflict related violence as well as crime. Yet, the literature often treats victimization homogeneously. The war victimization literature demonstrates that victimization leads to pro-social behavior, whereas the crime victimization literature is mixed on its effects on public goods preferences. Disaggregating victimization into separate categories, we argue that both types of victimization increase individuals’ demands for public goods, due to increased needs. Yet, while conflict victimization is linked to a collective experience, crime victimization is individual, and when it comes to the trade-off between social versus security policy preferences, we expect crime victims to place greater emphasis on law and order instruments. We analyze public goods preferences with original survey data from rural Liberia. Comparing the types of victimization in a multinomial regression, we find support for our argument that conflict victims are more supportive of social policies and basic public goods than crime victims who foremost value investment into security measures. Our results show the importance of a disaggregated approach to understanding the effects of violence.	Sarah Berens

This omission is unfortunate since government spending has different functions and impacts and the differences are undistinguished in the existing research. By capturing individual preferences regarding a specific types of government policy under the condition of unemployment, we assess how economic insecurity produces varying demands for government action. Building on the analytic distinction between social consumption and social investment (Beramendi et al., 2015), this paper examines the role of unemployment in social policy preferences. First, unemployment experience drives individual demand for social consumption and reduces support for investment. Second, the effect of income on social consumption is negative yet appears positive on social investment. Third, the effect of income is conditional on the experience of job loss, which is pronounced among lower income groups. The analysis of European Social Survey Wave 8 (2016) finds empirical evidence supporting arguments about the impacts of economic insecurity on individual preferences for a particular type of social expenditure.

In the first experiment, we explore whether priming individuals about the government programs they received, either tax-embedded or direct-spending, affects their views on redistributive policy and the mechanisms by which any effects occur.

While some research suggests that governments respond to changes in mass preferences, an increasing number of scholars claim that governments either disregard public opinion in general or are only influenced by the opinion of the wealthiest segments of the population. Given the central role of redistribution in European politics, this paper examines whether governmental redistributive policies respond to public opinion demands using a time-series cross-sectional analysis of data on aggregate redistributive preferences from seven advanced democracies (1980s-2017). We rely on a large dataset of survey data to estimate country-year measures of support for redistribution among different income groups to measure different levels of support for redistribution between the wealthy and the poor as well as between their influence on government action. The results shed light on the influence of group preferences and inequality on policy and allow for a critical evaluation governmental responsiveness to public demands.	Xavier Romero-Vidal

The use of moralizing language in populist discourse in the European Parliament, 1999 – 2014	This paper aims to enhance our understanding of populism by showing the importance of moralization in populist discourse. I argue that established theoretical assumptions, i.e. the construction of the people as morally superior and of the elite as evil, should be considered more thoroughly when measuring populism. The moral distinction between these two antagonist groups is a valuable means to identify populist discourse and to prevent conﬂating populism with empirically related concepts, e.g. radical right-wing ideology. To test the role of moralization in populist discourse, I propose a two-stage dictionary-approach, which allows to detect all references to the people and the elite and subsequently tests whether the two groups are framed in a moralizing manner. I evaluate my empirical strategy against other approaches using a text corpus of all speeches given in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014. Taking the moralizing notion of populism more seriously does not only contribute to our theoretical understanding of populist discourse and its impact on the political sphere, but also enables us to empirically distinguish populism and radical right ideology more clearly.

Novel conceptualizations and global survey experiments	Is there a global democratic deficit? This is considered a “key” concern (Nye 2001:2) in our age of globalization. Yet, there is little systematic conceptualization and empirical investigation in this respect. My project aims to do both. Following Norris’s (2011) approach of defining democratic deficits from the perspective of citizens, I conceptualize the global democratic deficit in absolute terms, i.e. based on an ideal of democracy (cf. Norris 2011), and in relative terms, i.e. benchmarking against existing political systems (cf. Moravcsik 2004). In a representative pilot survey of British citizens via YouGov two principal findings emerge: First, my (re-)conceptualizations of the global democratic deficit appear to be valid. Second, from the perspective of UK citizens, there seems to be a global democratic deficit in absolute and relative terms, albeit – perhaps surprisingly – not a major one. In the next project phase, I conduct representative surveys in Argentina, China, India, Russia, Spain, and the United States to further confirm the validity of my concepts and to assess the degree of democratic deficiency in global governance as perceived by people worldwide.

Recent debates on polarization have focused on the negative effect of polarized systems on a number of democratic outcomes. We argue that polarization has a negative effect on an important measure of the quality of democratic systems, satisfaction with democracy, at the individual level. However, we demonstrate that at high levels of issue diversity, defined as societal contestation taking place over a wide range of issues, the negative effect of polarization is minimized. Drawing on the deliberative democracy literature, we argue that at low levels of issue diversity, polarization makes compromise in society less likely and the political discourse more antagonistic. However, at higher levels of issue diversity, contestation and conflict can be diffused over a large range of issues, providing more favourable conditions for collective will formation and, ultimately, higher levels of satisfaction with democracy.

Popular Conceptualisations of Democracy in the Arab World	How do people in the Arab world conceive of democracy? Many studies have used survey data to explore the factors which lead individuals in the Arab world to support or reject democracy, but there has been little research into how survey respondents understand democracy. In this paper, I use data from Arab Barometer to investigate how Arabs interpret democracy and the influences on and effects of these conceptualisations. I find a significant divide between those who see democracy primarily as a process, involving elections, political equality and freedom to criticise the government, and those who view democracy mainly as an outcome, involving economic equality and provision of public welfare goods. Those with higher incomes, a greater level of education and who are more religious hold more process-oriented conceptualisations of democracy. More outcome-oriented conceptions of democracy are associated with greater support for democracy as a political system. These findings contribute to debates about the nature of public support for democracy in the Arab world, the compatibility between Islam and democracy and the difficulties of cross-national survey research on essentially-contested concepts.

This paper analyses the effect of financial bailouts on individual perceptions about the way democracy works. A common understanding of democracy is that it serves as a mechanism to moderate conflict over preferences by periodically giving citizens a chance to vote on those preferences. Alternation in power is, thus, associated with a possible change of a policy paradigm. This paper argues that this idea may be challenged in hyper-globalised contexts that are exposed to severe economic crisis. In this context, a trade-off between levels of globalisation and levels of procedural democracy can be defined. I use the euro-crisis that started in 2009 to develop my theoretical framework and exploit the use of financial bailouts as Bayesian mechanisms that resulted in a fundamental change about the way democracy works within EMU countries. Using data from the Eurobarometers between 2001 and 2017, and using a diff-in-diff analysis, I show how levels of satisfaction with democracy, trust in national parties and trust in national governments experienced a significant decline in bailout countries compared to non-bailout countries in the period under study.

The case of Romanian parliamentary elections in 2008 and 2012.	We propose to analyze the formal properties and the real consequences of a special Romanian electoral rule, hereby denoted by ρ, used in two parliamentary general election (in 2008 and 2012), and eventually replaced by a simpler plurality one. This rule was a mixed one, a hybrid between plurality and proportional rule. We first produce a formal model of this rule and analyze its consequences. Particularly, we emphasize the puzzling behavior of the ρ rule, especially the violation of desirable properties like monotonicity and independence by appealing to both hypothetical, as well as to particular outcomes of 2008 and 2012 Romanian general elections. We develooed a model of logistic regression to predict the odds of obtaining mandates when this electoral rule was applied. We argue that the success of a candidate does not only depend on the number of votes s/he received, but also on the votes of the party's other candidates in the same constituency, the rank of the party's candidate in the constituency, as well as the interaction between the rank and the size of the district.

We develop a model to show the relationship between changes in democracy and its impact on which voting block receives a higher distribution of public resources. Using the data of public housing between 2002 and 2016 and four general election results in Turkey, our OLS regression results show that our estimates of co-party bias using the public housing data follow the Polity IV trend closely: the less democratic Turkey becomes, the more co-party bias there is. We expand on this discovery through the use of fixed effects regression with instrumental variable estimation as our identification strategy.

Examining the social-group bases of third-party voting in recent British elections	While single-member district plurality electoral systems create incentives for voters to avoid supporting a party that will place third or worse in their district, recent research suggests non-trivial shares of voters do. To help understand why so many voters support third-placed parties, this paper examines an argument rooted in social cleavage theory holding that voters belonging to social groups represented by a particular party will be more likely to vote for that party in districts where it places third than other groups - even if they recognise that “their” party is out of the running in their district. Using data from the 2005-2010 British Election Panel Study, the analysis shows that, even after controlling for several alternative explanations of third-placed voting behavior, voters belonging to groups affiliated with particular political parties are significantly more likely to vote for their party in districts where the party places third or worse than voters belonging to other social groups.

In these systems, voters tend to become more party-centred there because votes for one candidate of a given party are pooled across the whole party. Moreover, following Carey and Shugart (1995), we argue that district magnitude moderates these effects. As district magnitude increases, the explanatory value of party-centred variables also rises when the electoral system does not foster personal vote-seeking, but it falls when the electoral rules foster personal vote-seeking. To test our expectations, we turn to the three first waves of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). This dataset selection helps us to maximize variation in electoral rules and, hence, allows us to leverage cross-system variation.	Pedro Riera

But why are background characteristics relevant? This paper argues that politicians from different socio-economic backgrounds have different personal experiences, specifically with unemployment, and that these experiences in turn shape their preferences for social policy. To study this question, we conducted a large survey to 900 Spanish mayors in Autumn 2018, as well as a survey to the general population. The surveys contained a priming experiment, where we randomly varied the order of questions about mayors’ unemployment experiences and their preferences towards social policies. We first show that exposure to unemployment (experienced personally or vicariously through family members and close friends) is much less frequent among mayors than in the general population. Next, we demonstrate that personal experiences have a causal role on shaping social policy preferences. Our paper contributes to the literature about political selection by highlighting a specific mechanism through which the personal background of elites affect their decisions on social policy.

Drawing on recent literature by Pontusson and Rueda (2010) and Anderson and Beramendi (2012) we formulate a set of hypotheses to explain the relationship between economic inequality, party competition and turnout. Specifically, we expect that in countries in which political parties compete and mobilize low-income voters through programmatic competition along the economic dimension should be the ones in which electoral participation has increased the most, especially turnout among low-income voters and where economic inequality has risen. As such, we expect a less pronounced negative relationship between economic inequality and political inequality with more programmatic competition. We exploit an integrated file with CSES individual-level data on turnout. We estimate two-stages weighted regression models employing a difference-in-difference approach, before and after the economic crisis. The results show that the differences in income-turnout slopes between low-income and high-income voters have become less important in countries with more programmatic competition. This paper has important implications for our understanding of the determinants of political inequality.	Francesc Amat

We investigate voting patterns in the Central Eastern European region since the beginning of transition using panel regressions. We find that the phenomenon of “hyper-accountability” identified by earlier scholarship is still prevalent in the region – incumbents on average lose substantially, and this phenomenon is even increasing with time. Secondly, economic conditions – specifically unemployment – exerts a powerful influence on incumbents’ re-election chances. Third, contrary to expectations expressed in earlier scholarship, the influence of unemployment does not strengthen over time, as its influence has weakened substantially in the last decade. Fourth, corruption also has an influence on re-election, although, interestingly, this effect manifests itself only within-countries (but not across countries): better scores in corruption in countries over time translate into higher share of votes (lower losses) for the incumbents. Fifth, inequality has no relationship with incumbents’ re-election chances. Sixth, we identify a rather robust interaction effect between unemployment and corruption. To be concrete, unemployment is an important factor in influencing election results in more corrupt countries, but not in “cleaner” ones. We discuss the implications of these findings.

With respect to economic performance, research on retrospective voting provides a clear expectation: a poorly performing economy means that voters are less likely to support the incumbent. But if economic decline turns them away from the incumbent, where do the voters go? How do voters choose among challengers? To address this question, we advance a general theory of retrospective voting and apply it to the choice between three governing party types: sitting incumbents, established alternatives, and inexperienced alternatives. We argue that voters choose in two stages. The first stage is a referendum on the incumbent party, which they evaluate in terms of its record as manager of the economy. In the second stage voters choose among challengers based on policy alternatives. When the cost of ruling is high, voters are more likely to revert to an established party option, even in the face of economic decline.

Reflections on the Consequences of Demand-Side Populism in Europe.	The proliferation of populist parties has contributed to the pertinence of the academic debate on the consequences of populism. Overall, most of the scholars’ attention has been directed towards supply-side populism, examining under what circumstances populist parties can be a threat to democracy. However, populism is far from being an exclusively elite-driven political phenomenon, which also invites to reflect about the consequences of populist preferences among citizens. Whit this goal in mind, I will utilize data from the last European Social Survey (ESS 2016) to examine what is the structure of basic human values shared by voters of populist parties. Given that human values have been found to orient political attitudes and political behavior, I suggest that relevant insights can be extracted from this analysis. In particular, I expect that populist voters will differ from the rest of the population with regards benevolence, universalism, and self-direction, although this can be mediated by the host ideology to what populism attaches in the electoral competition. The implications of these differences in the structure of values will be examined in detail.	Hugo Marcos-Marne

The impact of representation gaps on populist party success	Populist rhetoric everywhere depicts political representatives as corrupt and unresponsive. Is populist party success a reaction to real failures of ideological representation? Most studies explain populism via cultural-psychological and socio-economic predictors, focusing on individual-level (demand-side) explanations (Mudde, 2004, Inglehart and Norris, 2016, Rovira Kaltwasser et al., 2017). They appear to assume that the elite has indeed been unresponsive. Moreover, most studies use right-wing populist party support as the dependent variable, and results might be only relevant to this particular type of populism. This paper tests a supply-side explanation of populist success - elite ideological incongruence - and whether it mediates the impact of economic and cultural anxiety (both of the left and of the right). We test our hypothesis by employing modules 1-4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. We adopt Bayesian scaling to measure ideological congruence (sociotropic and egotropic) as well as a conjoint experiment to probe the causal mechanism. The paper weighs in on the debate over the potential ‘corrective influence’ of populism.

How populist attitudes and sense of crisis condition political participation.	Populist parties campaign successfully on the idea of “the people” linked to a shared group identity in times of crisis that must stand up against evil political elites to reclaim political sovereignty. Although undistorted implementation of people's will through more (direct) participation is a core demand in populist communication, empirical findings on the attitudes of populist citizens and the effects on their actual political engagement are mixed. Corresponding to social identity theory, a combination of strong in-group identification and an outside attack on the collective “us” actually promotes collective action. I argue that populist attitudes – creating a strong group identity through the antagonism of “the people” and the elites – only have a mobilizing effect, when they are combined with a perceived outside threat. Accordingly, this paper supplements populist attitudes with a new element (sense of crisis) and tests the relation with participation. Based on a representative survey conducted in Germany I show that only a combination of populist attitudes and sense of crisis leads to increased political engagement. Thus, this paper sheds light on the socio-psychological mechanisms behind populist mobilization.	Benjamin Schürmann

The Republic of Ireland is one of the few remaining West Europeans that does not (yet) have a successful PRR party, which raises the question of whether Irish history or culture makes it uniquely immune to the radical right or whether such a party could be successful. To examine this question, I field a unique survey experiment in which Irish respondents read about a hypothetical new party and subsequently assess their willingness to support that party. While the control condition describes a mainstream party, the treatment condition presents respondents with a hypothetical new radical right party. Analysis of the results indicate that there is substantial potential support for the radical right, particularly among those scoring high in authoritarianism, anti-immigration attitudes, and among younger respondents and supporters of independent candidates. These findings are consistent from those countries with PRR parties, suggesting that potential support for the radical right exists in Ireland as well.	Erik Tillman

Evidence from a survey experiment	The 2015 European migrant crisis led to significant electoral gains of populist right parties in most recent elections in Europe, albeit to different extents. We analyse whether electoral system type mediates populist right party success. More specifically, we investigate whether open lists give centrist parties the opportunity to attract electoral votes by offering individual candidates with positions that are more extreme than the party mean. Transferring and extending arguments introduced by Blumenau et al. (2017) in the context of Brexit politics in the UK, we assess how ballot types (closed and open list PR) and information on candidates’ immigration-related positions affect individuals’ vote choice.

Coalition formation and voting systems in pre- and post-Arab Spring Morocco	How do electoral coalitions form under weak party systems? We compare the Moroccan municipal elections before and after Morocco’s failed revolution – the Arab Spring. We leverage a discontinuity in the electoral rule; namely, that municipalities below 35,000 inhabitants use majority rule, while municipalities above 35,000 inhabitants use proportional representation (PR) to show that electoral dynamics have not been altered by the Arab Spring. In both elections, PR depresses turnout, benefits smaller, historical, programmatic parties at the expense of clientelistic parties, because mobilizing voters under PR draws more heavily on party’s organizational capacity, held by historical parties. Yet, coalition formation dynamics have changed after the Arab Spring, shifting from coalitions opposing programmatic to clientelistic parties to coalitions that include both types. We argue that this change owes to heightened uncertainty about voters’ behavior in the post-Arab Spring context, leading parties to form coalitions designed to minimize potential losses in an uncertain context instead of coalitions that maximize gains in a context where voters’ behavior is well-known.

Politics is thus increasingly described as ‘personalized’ in the sense that MPs see their representational task as more individualized (McAllister, 2007). This is a crucial development as it has important implications for party democracy. Still, we know little about if the behavior of politicians also have become more personalized (Rahat & Sheafer, 2007; Karvonen, 2010). The aim of this paper is to contribute to close this gap. The paper investigates British MPs’ maiden speeches from 1945-2017. The British case allows us to investigate personalization in a setting with strong parties and an electoral system that provides an incentive for MPs to personalize their behavior. Furthermore, maiden speeches provide an unique opportunity to track personalization over a long time span, in a speech where floor time is not restricted by the party and where factors such as seniority and leadership position is kept constant. To analysis the large corpus of speeches, this paper utilize quantitative text analysis and develops a general dictionary for analyzing political personalization.	Marie Kaldahl Nielsen

We examine changes over time in the substantive topics addressed by women MPs and also explore developments in their rates of participation. Using a rich dataset of MP demographic characteristics (including education, occupational background and age) and political characteristics (such as party affiliation, career length, leadership experience, constituency profile and seat marginality), we test whether there are independent gender differences in members’ speech patterns and emphasis. In particular, we examine the policy focus of female versus male MPs. To unveil these patterns MP speech content is analysed using a new dynamic topic model. This method is applied to the full corpus of legislative speeches from January 1919 to November 2017. Substantively, our findings suggest that women representatives’ agenda evolves over time and reacts to exogenous events such the rise of women’s movement and membership of the European Union and that, controlling for political and demographic characteristics, women’s policy focus is distinct from that of their male counterparts.

A study showing how German representatives control male and female ministers	Despite increasing chances for women to rise to top positions of the executive, we know little about how male MPs react to this development and how they use parliamentary oversight mechanisms to control women who gain power. This paper steps into this gap by answering the following questions: Do representatives control female ministers more tightly than male ministers? And, how does the relationship vary by portfolio? We draw on unique data covering four decades of parliamentary activity in the German Bundestag to answer these questions. The ministry addressed by written parliamentary requests – the main tool of representatives to control the government in parliamentary democracies – constitutes our dependent variable. Our findings reveals that male representatives are particularly likely to direct questions to female ministries with portfolios that might be described as gender-neutral (e.g. environment) or masculine (e.g. economy). Men control womens's executive tasks more tightly when they govern in other policy areas than traditional women’s issues.

Recent research has told us much about the role of gender in political career outcomes, including election to parliament and ministerial selection. What happens after ministerial selection – and thus the effect of gender on career outcomes at the highest levels of politics – has received less systematic attention. Ministerial stability is one metric of ministerial career success and existing findings on gender and ministerial stability are both mixed and limited in empirical scope. Using a data set on 4000 individual ministers in 35 parliamentary and semi-presidential systems since the 1980s, this paper examines the effects of gender on stability in government. It employs a party-centred competing risks approach and finds that women have had a substantially higher risk of individual exit from cabinet through resignation, dismissal, or losing eligibility for office than their male colleagues. It explores how the effects of gender vary depending on, first, the principals’ (prime ministers’ and party leaders’) attributes, including their political ideology, age, and their own gender and, second, the political context, including the gender composition of cabinet and of the pool of ministrables.

Using a rich dataset of the entire adult Danish population, including all political candidates from 1990 to 2013, we explore how gender composition and order of siblings affect probability of running for office. First, we investigate the importance of gender composition and gendered stereotyping. We expect that parents’ gendered upbringing affects political aspirations and that political aspirations are primarily considered to be masculine. Because gendered upbringing is stronger when parents have children of both sexes, we expect that first-born women should have a higher likelihood of running if their younger sibling is a woman rather than a man. Second, we investigate the importance of sibling order and gender. Being the oldest sibling provides children with leadership experience. We expect that this role as the older sibling has the strongest effect for women, counteracting the effects of gendered upbringing.

Examining Party and Gender Differences in Candidate Retention	While research on women’s political representation has substantially increased our understanding of what it takes to get elected, we know little of the faith of unsuccessful candidates. Yet, in the context where parties struggle with dropping membership numbers and limited supply of high-quality candidates, retention of existing - both electorally successful and unsuccessful - candidates is crucial. To address this gap, we propose a dynamic approach to investigate the probability of previously (un)successful male and female candidates to reappear on the ballot paper. Is past electoral performance rewarded or punished the same way for all candidates, or are there party- and gender-specific differences in candidate retention? We answer this question with a purpose-built longitudinal dataset covering the last four rounds of German general elections. We find evidence that each German Bundestag election brings to the electoral contest a large number of new candidates - both men and women – who have not contested the federal level legislative seat before. The data also show that candidates’ past electoral performance is not rewarded identically for men and woman in all parties.	Maarja Lühiste

Due to less costly and competitive electoral campaigns, women can have easier access to sub-national parliaments. At the same time, this impact might be mitigated by specific institutional constellations such as party systems and gender quotas. We argue that the effect of decentralization on women’s legislative representation is dependent on the political relevance of the sub-national units in the national political system measured by the RAI index. To test this, we use an original dataset on women’s legislative representation in 383 regional parliaments in 20 European countries from 1970 to 2018. Preliminary results show that despite the general increase in women’s representation over time, it remains lower in the more relevant sub-national parliaments. Thus, enhancing the attractiveness of these political positions to the mostly male political elite inhibits women’s electoral success in regional parliaments.	Kristina Gushchina

I argue that party leaders can neutralize potential (male) challengers by strategically blocking their careers through the selective use of gender quotas in their constituencies. I explore this possibility in the context of the 2015 Mexican legislative election, in which a major party reserved a set of single-member districts for female politicians in order to comply with the legally-mandated national quota. Using an original dataset that combines information on reserved districts with results from the party's previous internal elections, I find evidence that the decision of what districts to reserve is indeed driven, to a large extent, by intraparty competition. Specifically, I find that the party leaders were more likely to reserve districts where the support for their faction in the party’s internal elections was lower. These findings have important implications for the literature on the adoption of party quotas, and provide a complementary answer to the puzzle of why predominantly male political elites promote the adoption of these policies.

Yet the empirical findings suggest that many of these institutional and political factors actually have quite a modest effect on pledge fulfilment. This paper addresses this puzzle by questioning the assumption that election pledges reveal true party intentions. Political parties make some pledges that they genuinely intend to fulfil; while other promises are made to be broken. It is only by restricting the analysis to the former set of pledges that the true effects of institutional and political variables on pledge fulfilment can be measured. This argument is tested using new data on economic pledges in Ireland. In order to distinguish true promises from false promises, I examine the characteristics of the pledge, including its specificity and whether or not it has been costed by the Department of Finance.

However, only a minority of voters believes that politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to accurately recall the fulfilment or breaking of salient campaign pledges. I argue that this disparity between public perception and reality is partially driven by the information voters receive in the media. Based on a new text corpus of over 480,000 sentences on pledges published in 25 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, I find support for these expectations. The number of statements about broken promises is between 1.5 and 2 times larger than the number of statements about fulfilled promises, indicating a consistent negativity bias. Moreover, tabloid newspapers express much more negative sentiment in statements on promises when the endorsed party is not in government, whereas partisan broadsheet papers do not change their style of reporting. The results have important implications for studying negative information in mass media, and the linkage between voters and parties.	Stefan Müller

In this paper I draw upon a body of research on retrospective voting that has largely focussed on electoral accountability with respect to the economy. The theoretical framework presented in this study links government parties’ performances to their previous electoral pledges in various policy fields. I argue that pledge performance matters to voters because they care about the policies upon which parties have been elected into office, scrutinise whether these parties have stuck to their promises, and subsequently reward (punish) them at the following election for a good (bad) pledge performance. In this study, the hypothesis of “pledge performance based voting” is tested at the individual level, with CSES and National Election survey data in 12 countries and from 50 elections by drawing on logistic regressions. Additionally, moderating factors at the institutional, government and individual level are considered. The findings of this study improve our understanding of citizens’ retrospective voting considerations and have crucial implications for the democratic ideal of promissory representation.

The influence of partisan motivated reasoning and political attention	This article investigates how voters infer the direction of policy change by coalition parties. Research posits that coalition parties try to maintain their public profile by communicating their policy differences to the public. Yet other work suggests that voters are not receptive to such party messages because they rely instead on a simple coalition heuristic to update their perceptions of parties’ policy positions. This article contributes to the debate by examining the influence of partisan motivated reasoning and attention to politics. I argue that voters increasingly emphasise policy differences between coalition parties the more attention they pay to politics. This tendency is particularly strong among voters who identify with a coalition party. Joining a coalition induces partisan motivated reasoning whereby supporters of a coalition party push the other coalition party further away from their own position (contrast bias) while pulling their own party closer to them (assimilation bias).

Radical right parties have been increasingly successful across Europe. While the literature has focused on explaining electoral support for radical right parties, little is known about their consequences on government policy. We posit that radical right parties pose a major challenge to coalition parties even though they are typically not in government. They constitute a threat to government survival and are able to attract voters across traditional lines of conflict weakening coalition parties across the entire ideological spectrum. We thus hypothesize that coalition cabinets go tough on immigration if they are confronted with radical right parties and that this effect increases with the vote losses that coalition parties have suffered. Our theoretical argument is tested based on a newly compiled dataset that brings together data on coalition agreements and election results across 24 Western and Eastern European democracies from 1945 until 2015. Our results have major implications for our understanding of party competition, government policy-making and how radical right parties transform European democracies more generally.	Fabio Ellger

Electoral effects of dropping out of coalition talks	Before coalition governments are established, political parties engage in coalition talks in which the coalition’s policy agenda and the distribution of ministerial offices are negotiated. It frequently happens that parties abandon coalition talks despite having spent weeks or even months in negotiations with potential parties, thereby significantly delaying government formation. Despite the central importance of timely government formation for the stability and performance of political systems, we hardly know anything about why parties abandon coalition talks, giving up attractive ministerial posts and risking public blaming. In this paper, we argue that parties abandon coalition negotiations as they expect to reap electoral gains. The positive electoral effect is, however, conditioned by the extent to which parties would have to make concessions to their partners and by party type. To test our theoretical expectations comparatively and over time, we have compiled a comprehensive dataset on the electoral performance of 202 political parties running in 196 elections in 27 European countries from 1974-2014.

Contrary to the previous studies which focus on the effect of propaganda on ideology formation in an authoritarian regime, this paper looks at the role of policy experimentation in shaping ideology. In this framework, an autocrat who cares about political survival chooses policy experimentation which in turn affects the structure of economy. Citizens choose level of effort in the economy. Ideology is defined as citizens' believe of how the economy should work. Citizens form ideology based on their experiences in the economy. If citizens' ideology diverges far enough from the regime's ideology, they withdraw their support for the regime. This framework is used to explain the evolution of ideology in today's China.

We use unique individual-level administrative records preceding secret ballot that contain information on which candidate(s) each voter voted for and the voters’ occupations. While we do not find strong evidence of a cleavage along the working and middle class divide, we find evidence of a union of the landed gentry, farm workers, non-skilled workers and white-collar workers voting on average more for the Conservatives, and petty bourgeoisie and skilled workers for the Liberals in a cross-section. The changes in voting behavior within individuals due to social mobility are immediate and mainly consistent with the same cleavage. One interpretation is that voting was influenced by economic incentives related to the interests of the new and old industries, but voting was to less extent determined by class background.

I use administrative registry data on local politicians in Finland to examine the markers of politician quality that are typically employed in empirical research. Exploiting exogenous variation generated by close electoral races that shift the quality composition of local councils, I show that high-income, re-elected incumbent and competent politicians (i.e., politicians with high residuals from a Mincer income regression) improve fiscal sustainability outcomes without cutting public goods and services provision. Symmetrically, university-educated local councilors manage to increase public spending without affecting fiscal sustainability. I use unique survey data on candidates’ policy positions to show that politician quality is also associated with economic ideology. These correlations are in line with the policy effects that I find. Thus, good representatives on both sides of the political spectrum improve policies.	Jaakko Meriläinen

I argue that this is driven by member states cultivating ties with particular UN agencies through ideologically-driven donations to these agencies, which leads the agencies to be responsive to the donors' preferences. Consequently, states ultimately prefer the inefficiencies than risking issues being handled by agencies to which they have weaker ties. I investigate this claim empirically by showing that countries' ideological orientations influence their donation behavior in the UN. Not only do countries that are ideologically close to the US contribute more, their donation preferences differ even among agencies that are thematically similar. The results extend our understanding of states' informal influence on IOs, and highlight that continued inefficiency in the operation of UN agencies may be a pernicious problem to solve.

There are more subtle things going on. Subconsciously, web browsing opens up a world of styles and impressions. To some of those styles we are used to, but often it is just unfamiliar language, new images and experiences. How does it matter that we read text, information, entertainment written in style (and language) that is not our own ? The current debate both in academia and the real world about the negative effects of the internet on political polarization are well known. The arguments circle around overt features of communication, social networks and outright misinformation. What is often overlooked though is the impressionistic richness of out online lives. This experiment/ project tests predictions on the effect of style on 1) biased reasoning and 2) political fragmentation. Our conjecture is the idea that unfamiliar style makes us actually more realistic about power and the need for compromise. We provide evidence that diverse style, as opposed to diverse content can enhance subconscious contrasting and political realism.	soenke ehret

Using a quasi-experimental design that exploits temporal and geographical variation in exposure to hurricanes in the United States, I find that as proximity to and intensity of disasters increases, individuals become more risk loving. I argue this is because individuals trade off private and public insurance as severity of exposure changes. I collect and harness rich data from multiple sources, including novel data on US hurricane trajectory, longitudinal precinct results and insurance-related internet searches. Studying within-state behaviour, I find that being closer to a hurricane path increases the individual's intensity of inquiry for private insurance. Because of these changes, public insurance demand decreases and Republicans experience a significant electoral gain following natural disasters. These effects are particularly important as US elections follow closely after the hurricane season.	RALUCA PAHONTU

In the same border municipalities, we find that support for the anti-immigrant Swiss People’s Party rose by approximately five percentage points after borders were opened. In additional analyses, we explore the effects of opening borders on economic outcomes, on preferences for social spending, and on attitudes revealed in survey responses.

The fiscal windfall was due to the flotation of Glencore on the London Stock Exchanged, which caused an extraordinary local income tax revenue paid by a resident of the municipality of Rüschlikon (about 160 million CHF). Most of the municipal tax payment entered the resource equalization scheme and rained down on the municipalities of the canton inducing a temporary windfall (1 million CHF on average). Based on this quasi-natural experiment we investigate how this one-time fiscal windfall affected municipal budgetary decisions. Using detailed accounting data at the municipal level, we are able to estimate the causal effect of the windfall on all accounting positions. Our results show that the windfall caused large budgetary shifts and considerable expenditures increases and revenue decreases beyond the windfall.	Simon Berset

In this article we address the aforementioned question by uniquely matching Reasoned Opinions (ROs) issued by national parliaments under the EWS with their governments’ votes and formal policy statements in EU Council negotiations. Based on a novel dataset that includes more than 400 matched legislative proposals (9,636 country-vote observations) we find empirical evidence for a strong and positive relation between ROs and negative votes. Moreover, Commission proposals that received ROs have a significantly higher probability to be ultimately withdrawn altogether, even in the absence of a yellow card. Our results run counter to the dominant view in the literature that the EWS has a marginal impact on EU decision-making. Instead, it constitutes a clear signal that negotiations are likely to fail.

The goal of this system is for Parliaments to police the subsidiarity principle. If one third of Parliaments issue an RO, a yellow card is triggered and the Commission has to reconsider its proposal. This article identifies the dimensions of conflict in the EWS using dyadic regressions on the co-issuance of ROs by Parliaments.

The goal of this system is for Parliaments to police the subsidiarity principle. If one third of Parliaments issue an RO, a yellow card is triggered and the Commission has to reconsider its proposal. This article identifies the dimensions of conflict in the EWS using dyadic regressions on the co-issuance of ROs by Parliaments. It finds that closely aligned levels of economic development, rather than geographical or ideological proximity, are most strongly associated with the co-issuance of ROs. In addition, increasing co-issuance over time suggests that more yellow cards may be issued in the future.	Martijn Huysmans

Inter-departmental coordination is one possible solution to that challenge. Which factors motivate departments to engage in coordination? To what extent are they motivated by concern for administrative turf? On the theoretical side, this article presents a model of turf war in government administrations. It derives testable hypotheses that discriminate between two motivations for coordination, namely “efficiency concerns” and “turf war.” On the empirical side, we test those hypotheses by studying all policy proposals adopted by the European Commission between 2015 and 2017—a total of approx. 5,000 cases. To this end, we present a new data set which is based on CIS-net, the Commission's internal coordination platform. We find that departments are more likely to enter into coordination if they expect competing departments to become active, too. The size of this effect increases in the political salience of proposals. Overall, our findings indicate that interdepartmental coordination in the European Commission is significantly motivated by concern for administrative turf.	Daniel Finke

Evidence from a Times-Series Cross-Sectional Analysis	The literature on the relationship between EU integration and regional power has produced two opposing theoretical models. Depending on the model, EU integration leads to either an increase or decrease in regional power. Evidence for both, however, has been limited to qualitative case studies, with inconclusive results. This paper, on the other hand, offers a quantitative, large-N analysis, using data from fifty-six countries between 1960 and 2010.

The literature on informal decision-making points to the risk of policy drift towards key figures. Both chambers should select the key negotiators strategically if the potential for agency drift exists. I test whether the Parliament selects its key negotiator, the rapporteur, strategically using new data on individual preferences of all members of Parliament, national and European party affiliations as well as committee memberships within Parliament. To identify the effect of informal negotiations on rapporteur selection, I exploit a rule change in 1999, where file conclusion using informal first reading agreements became possible for the first time. I estimate local average treatment effects using a regression discontinuity approach and provide evidence for strategic selection. The Parliament selects more centrist agents overall and more moderate party group members. Five-hundred placebo tests over a twenty-years period illustrate the robustness of the findings.

We identify the key players and study the member states’ and institutions’ optimal strategies. Moreover, we analyze why the EU uses a special procedure to impose antidumping duties, rather than the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) that applies to most legislation, including other trade policy issues. Our model concludes that the use of a special procedure allows the EU to pursue more protectionist antidumping policies than it could under the OLP, if the European Parliament (EP) is less protectionist than the pivotal member states. We use Bayesian item response models to compare the positions of the EP and the pivotal member states on trade issues between 2009 and 2018, and find that the EP is indeed less protectionist. We further focus on specific antidumping cases to illustrate the rationale for using a special procedure. Our analysis shows that the antidumping procedure can provide an outlet for the concerns of protectionist member states in an environment otherwise characterized by trade liberalization.

However, the reasons why governments choose to do so are still under-explored. Scholarship so far has failed to address this issue in a comprehensive manner, focusing either on the responsiveness of governments to societal demands, or on the use of subsidies as an electioneering tool. Drawing on the literature on distributive politics and political economics, the paper adapts Persson and Tabellini’s model of democratic policy-making to join these two perspectives. Looking at State aid allocation in 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) between 1992 and 2011, the paper asks why some countries grant more State aid than others. The model tests how aid allocation depends on the attainment of policy goals (namely correction of market failures), electoral pragmatism and the responsibility towards international commitments. The implications are relevant for the management of State aid control in Europe, as well as for the more general understanding of the so-called interventionist state in Western democracies.

How can we explain these contradicting observations? In this article, I argue that free movement creates an attitudinal trade-off for citizens between their own citizenship-rights and the citizenship rights of perceived 'others'. To assess the ambivalence of citizens' attitudes towards free movement and to test the postulated hypothesis, I use cross-country observational data and a survey experiment in 28 EU countries. The empirical findings suggest that public attitudes toward a border-free Europe are systematically ambivalent due to a tension between the value of the own mobility rights and the fear of immigration from other EU countries.

Trilogues have become the central arena of EU legislative politics. Despite their central role, empirical knowledge about the proceedings in trilogues is scarce due to their seclusion from public scrutiny. Applying a rigorous process tracing analysis, this paper contributes to closing this gap. On the basis of an innovative analytical division between the content and the process of legislative negotiations, a fine-grained theoretical model of causal mechanisms is developed. This model is tested in an empirical analysis of the negotiations on two legislative files. The analysis rests on a rich data pool of 20+ interviews with participants of the negotiations as well as public and non-public documents. The author finds that the shape of the negotiation process indeed has repercussions on the quality of legislation due to three factors: The nature of coalitions, the degree of informal coordination and the character of delegation. Further, he can explain how the institutional environment of trilogues fosters these effects.	Alexander Hoppe

As the Commission is usually not required to choose a given legal instrument, it is quite surprising that we know little to nothing about the factors that influence these decisions. In this paper, we propose and test in particular two hypotheses: First, we expect that the choice of a regulation becomes more likely over time once the general matters of the policy area have been addressed via directives (H1). Second, we expect the Commission to resort to directives under conditions of high preference heterogeneity in the Council as the directives grant the preference outliers more leeway at the implementation stage than regulations (H2). We test these hypotheses using an original dataset of all directives and regulations proposed by the Commission between the year 1998 and 2018.	Yves Steinebach

Reflecting differences between political elites, increasing party polarization on a given policy motivates the EP to curtail a prospect of bureaucratic drift in case of delegation to the national administrations, and therefore enhances parliamentary motivation to empower the European Commission acting as a neutral broker. Policy salience further exacerbates the need of the EP to insulate policy implementation from the national influences to ensure a relatively uniform policy outcome across the member-states. To test these conjunctions we rely on the data from the Euromanifesto project as well on the dataset on agency discretion and delegation dynamic in the EU.	Sebastian Popa

Instead, the history of the EU has very much been a history of ad hoc institutional adaptation, with institutions altered in response to changing demands and needs and reflecting the interests of the various actors involved at the time. Nowhere has this process of instrumental adaptation been more apparent than in the shifting roles of the Council of the European Union and its executive and legislative interlocutors, the European Council and European Parliament. This research examines the shifting power dynamics between these three institutions from the creation of the European Economic Community through the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty through the lens of historical institutionalism, with a particular focus on the critical junctures surrounding the inception of summitry and the birth of the European Council and the empowerment of the European Parliament following the introduction of direct elections.

The literature on the politicization of bureaucracy argues that politicized senor staffing is negatively associated with bureaucratic capacity and performance in an organizational level (e.g. Krause, Lewis, & Douglas, 2006; Lewis 2010), but it has not examined the mechanism at work. This paper investigates how politicized senior staffing will affect senior officials’ work attitudes including job satisfaction and organizational commitment in different echelons by using the COCOPS Executive Survey on Public Sector Reform in Europe (Hammerschmid, 2015). Specifically, the paper tries to identify systematic differences in positions of senior management. The preliminary result shows that those in lower positions of senior management are more likely to be affected by functional politicization (Christensen, Klemmensen, & Opstrup, 2014), rather than by political appointments. Additionally, I hypothesize that the effects of politicization on work attitudes may be contingent on public-like structure of bureaucracy. The strength of the association varies depending on how senior officials expect about their life-long tenure (Dahlström & Lapuente, 2017).	Hyunjung Kim

Regulating private actors’ participation in policymaking is key to democratic governance. Across political systems, targeted transparency is used to regulate lobbying. We examine the extent to which primary regulatory targets (organizations with frequent access to decision-makers) support the architecture of lobbying regulation regimes set up as voluntary transparency clubs. Our empirical testing ground is the European Union. We conceptualize the EU Transparency Register as a Voluntary Transparency Club, elaborate on its club goods, and derive a set of theoretical expectations about members’ evaluations of the club’s transparency standards, membership size, and monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We test our argument on an original dataset providing information about 632 organisations. We find significant differences between members and non-members’ assessment of the club’s regulatory performance. Members with frequent access to high-level decision-makers criticize the club’s transparency standards and its regulatory effectiveness. Yet, they support expanding its regulatory remit and increasing club membership. No significant differences mark their support for stricter monitoring/enforcement mechanisms.

Obviously, measuring the complexity of public policy is challenging, which is why many researchers fall back on narrow proxies. I develop a concise and measurable definition of policy complexity with the help of humans' ability to understand text. Specifically, I ask crowd-workers to encode complexity by conducting pairwise comparisons of policies - simply indicating which text is more complex. To create suitable micro-tasks, crowd-workers do not read the entire texts of EU policies but individual articles and summaries of legislation provided by the EUR-Lex database. Next, a random utility model produces posterior estimates for the policies’ positions on the complexity scale as well as the workers’ reliability. The final output is a score for each individual article/case on a continuous metric. This complexity score is brought together with additional information about the text of the rule (e.g. rarity of words) to understand why humans consider certain policies more complicated than others.

Some politically active interest groups have clearly articulated policy positions on one or more policy dimensions while other politically active groups do not. While group related characteristics are likely to explain parts of such variation in interest group position-taking, this paper hypothesizes that party policy and the salience of the respective policy dimension also matter. By utilizing novel data from the 'Party-Interest Group Relationships in Contemporary Democracies' (PAIRDEM) project on interest group positions in six different European countries as well as the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), this paper investigates how interest group position-taking is affected by party positions and salience across six policy dimensions. The analysis shows that an interest group is more likely to have an articulated position when the policy dimension is salient in the particular country and the parties are divided on the policy dimension in question. This means that agenda setting dynamics also influence interest group position-taking.	Vibeke Wøien Hansen

Disentangling Gender Differences in European Parliament Speechmaking	Research on parliamentary speechmaking and debate participation has consistently shown that women speak less than men, especially on policy issues considered 'hard' or 'masculine'. Little is known, however, about the mechanism behind this finding; in other words: why do women take the floor less often? Social role theory suggests that women self-select into speaking on certain issues in accordance with gender stereotypes. On the other hand, research has found that women are often assigned to 'soft' policy areas, indicating that party leaders act as potential gatekeepers to the floor. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of speechmaking in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2018, we seek to gain a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting differences in the allocation of speaking time between modes of debate to disentangle the mechanisms that drive floor participation. The results will show how and under what conditions supply- and demand-side mechanisms affect women's and men's participation in debates in the European Parliament. Our findings have implications for the connection between descriptive and substantive representation of women at the European level and beyond.	Verena Kunz

In the EP, the informalisation linked with such early agreements has empowered committees and their members to the detriment of the full plenary and transparency. Responding to these developments, the EP decided to introduce obligatory roll-call votes for final votes at committee level, providing novel insights into how MEPs vote away from the limelight of the plenary. This paper analyses MEP voting behaviour based on a new dataset comprising all committee-level roll-call votes during the 2014-2019 legislative term. Drawing on the literatures on early agreements and broader legislative as well as comparative politics, it derives and tests hypotheses on what behaviour to expect at committee level. The findings help us better understand the implications of decision-making at the committee level of the EP.	Lukas Obholzer

Parliamentary questions of MEPs as a Proxy of Constituency Focus: Effect of Electoral Institutions and Career Ambitions	Written parliamentary questions (PQs) is the only activity of the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), in which they are almost free from the control of their two principals, national parties and the European Political Groups. It is therefore a valid proxy of their preferences and orientations, including the level of responsiveness to the national constituencies.Using the “bag of words” model to depict the presence of constituency focus in the solo-written PQs of MEPs served in the 7th European Parliament (EP), I show that electoral institutions for the European and national elections shape MEPs’ constituency orientations. Moreover, MEPs elected in the party-centered electoral systems are more constituency-oriented in their questions. That implies that MEPs take their future careers in the EP seriously, while creation of reputations among the party leaders mediate MEPs responsiveness to their respective constituencies. The argument also stands for the MEPs who want to move their careers to the national level, as party-centerdness of ballot for the national elections has also a positive significant effect on the level of MEPs' constituency focus.

The case of the European Union	Despite rising scholarly attention in political communication and electoral studies, we know rather little about the so-called personalization of politics with respect to the behaviour of politicians. This paper asks to what extent there is evidence for this phenomenon in the legislative behaviour of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and puts forward several hypotheses regarding moderating variables at the individual level (career), the party (mainstream vs. challenger party) and the electoral system. These are tested on a dataset that comprises all parliamentary questions (PQs) asked by MEPs between 1999 and 2017 (N=141,271). The preliminary findings suggest that the ratio of PQs that are asked only by one individual MEP does not increase over time relative to PQs that are supported by several MEPs. This would imply that legislative behaviour does not become more personalized over time. However, there are more MEPs asking more PQs over time, especially MEPs representing citizens from crisis ridden countries such as Greece and Ireland. Initial results further suggest that individual-level variables and party affiliations are more important than electoral systems for explaining personalization trends.	Katjana Gattermann

In the face of such challenges, establishment actors face an important choice: whether to employ a strategy of disparagement, i.e. seeking to portray the challenger as democratically illegitimate, or engaging with it on par with other parties. Existing research into this choice examines only party system- or party-level variation. This paper revisits an oft-studied case in the literature, responses in the Danish party system to the entry of the right-wing populist Danish People's Party. I take a text as data approach, applying machine learning methods to around 16,000 paragraphs of legislative speech to measure responses at the level of individual speeches. Using this novel approach, which allows for a uniquely granular characterization of responses to right-wing populist parties, I uncover systematic individual-level, within-party variation, unexamined in the existing literature. The results suggest an important role for individual-level factors in explaining establishment responses to populist challenges.	Frederi Hjorth

While there is considerable evidence for their relative stability (in terms of duration and turnover) and efficiency, minority government might also be normatively desirable from a deliberation and quality of democracy standpoint: As governments need to actively seek approval of their proposals in parliament, opposition parties have the opportunity to shape policy outcomes through the parliamentary process.

We compare legislative speeches of minority and majority governments to investigate the conditions under which patterns of legislators’ involvement and debate style change under either form of government.

The Effect of Polarization on Parties’ Compromise Rhetoric in 7 European Democracies, 1995 - 2013	Current Western democracies are plagued by trends of increasing polarization and electoral fragmentation. Combined, stable government formation has become more difficult and protracted, as the last formations in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden demonstrate. Polarization seems to intensify political elites’ reluctance to compromise. We investigate when (changes in) polarization influenced parties’ compromise rhetoric. Utilizing parliamentary speeches for Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom between 1995 and 2013, we develop an innovative measure of parties’ compromise rhetoric employing and validating the Lasswell Value Dictionary on Cooperation. Combining our measure with existing data on institutions and ideology, we demonstrate that on average parties’ compromise rhetoric has decreased. Our results show that how polarization influences parties’ compromise rhetoric varies over institutional settings. For countries with a majoritarian government tradition, the more polarization leads to lower levels of willingness to compromise. For countries with a coalition government tradition, mainstream parties’ willingness to compromise was hardly affected by polarization due to mutual dependence. Thereby, the results of our study contribute to debates on legislative politics, party competition and polarization.	Anthea Alberto

Questions are one of the most individual, flexible, and public ways that MPs can try to influence what their governments. As such, they allow us to look below the level of parliaments and parties to try to understand why individual MPs choose to focus on Europe. Using original web-scraped data on questions and interviews with MPs, I find that Eurosceptic MPs, opposition MPs, and those focused on more Europeanized policy areas are more likely to ask about Europe. In countries with higher levels of public Euroscepticism, pro-EU MPs are even less likely to ask about Europe, while Eurosceptic ones are more likely to do so. However, when there are short-term spikes in Euroscepticism, all MPs become more likely to ask about Europe. I also find that questions are used as a substitute for other tools or options for attempting to influence their governments' positions on Europe.	Lauren Perez

Despite its status as the world’s most powerful court, recent scholarship has identified substantial self-restraint when the Court receives signals from member states. To date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered court behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on the effect of external strategic considerations on allocation of influence within the Court. Contrary to many other international courts, influence in the CJEU is individualized and distributed at the discretion of its leadership. This paper argues that the president seeks to enhance the Court’s position by strategic use of experienced members and emphasis of individual independence. Yet, case allocations remain sensitive to the broader (political) context. To support its arguments, the paper draws on original data including allocations in 6263 preliminary reference cases brought before the CJEU (1958-2015). The results speak to the key role of internal organization for judicial independence as well as the interdependence between state-signatories and the court’s leadership.	Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen

Explaining the case selection for judicial review at the Court of Justice of the European Union	Scholars widely agree that the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) may exploit policy conflict in the EU legislature in order to make pro-integrationist judgments. Taking a step back, however, we do not know which kinds of cases end up before the court in the first place. I examine the three main judicial procedures – annulments, infringement proceedings and preliminary references – and develop a strategic account for under which procedure laws might be reviewed. Analyzing 160,000 legal acts, from the early days of the European Coal and Steel Community until 2018, I find that policy conflict in the legislature affects the probability that legal acts will be subject to an annulment request or an infringement proceeding. For preliminary references, I find that policy conflict is an important factor when judges decide whether to hear a case or not. My findings imply that policy conflict may hinder rather than help the CJEU, as case selection sets important scope conditions for judicial activism to materialize. They also provide novel insights for the debate on whether unelected judicial actors can drive European integration.	David Hilpert

ETH Zurich, Switzerland	p	85213	417	Acceptability before and Acceptance after Experiencing Disruptive Technologies: The Case of a Self-Driving Bus Service Trial in Switzerland	The uptake of disruptive technologies such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) impacts society and existing governance alike. Through vehicle automation, positive impacts (e.g. on road-safety) can be expected. However, these predicted effects can only arise if AVs are accepted by society, as public acceptance is a necessary condition to successfully implement policies allowing a transition towards automated road traffic. Attitudes towards disruptive technologies have been found to be a precursor in citizens’ acceptance formation process. In other contexts, acceptance increases when individuals experienced successful (policy) implementation. Thus, higher support can be expected after implementation as preliminary anxieties show to be arbitrary and individuals get familiar with the new technology. The paper at hand examines citizens’ attitudes towards AVs explaining the acceptance of policies aiming at vehicle automation and how this changes pre- and post-implementation of a self-driving bus service. To assess these questions with a difference-in-difference approach, I use a representative sample of approximately 900 Swiss residents from a three-wave panel survey conducted between 2018 and 2019 in one municipality experiencing such a trial and two municipalities serving as control groups.

It has been widely criticized for being inefficient and discriminatory, as few arrests are made and racial and ethnic minorities are stopped more often than whites. This paper examines if the program affects the life of unauthorized immigrants, who are likely to be particularly wary of interacting with the police. We combine data on police stops around university campuses with individual-level administrative data on student's performance and documentation status. The results show that undocumented students' study performance, relative to students with legal status, is adversely affected by the number of stops around campus. The results illustrate that stop-and-frisk and related police tactics have unintended spill-over effects on the behavior of unauthorized immigrants.	Niklas Harder

The Indian government currently promotes the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a clean alternative with a scale program covering the upfront costs of the new technology for the household. However, even after adopting LPG, a major fraction of the rural population continues to rely on solid biomass as the primary cooking fuel. One reason for the limited use of LPG could be that the health effects of solid biomass used for cooking are not sufficiently known to the households. We examine this hypothesis through an experiment providing randomized health information to 550 beneficiaries of the program in rural India. Our results indicate that health information significantly increases the willingness to pay for the next LPG cylinder and has a strongly positive impact on consumption behavior.

Contractarian orthodox rational choice theorists, such as David Gauthier (1986) and Michael Moehler (2018), object that instrumental reasons to abstract from arbitrary contingencies obtain insofar as bargainers internalise Rawls’ intuitions about fairness. In a pluralistic world, they maintain, we should not take this for granted. In this paper, I attempt to show that contractarian orthodox rational choice theorists need not be sceptical about abstraction. In fact, rational agents have instrumental reasons to abstract from some arbitrary contingencies (i.e. their current set of preferences and goals) when facing long-ranging, wide-ranging and one-way choices, regardless of their intuitions concerning fairness. Reasons to abstract stem from one’s uncertainty about future aims and aspirations, and invite agents to choose arrangements that provide them with flexibility. Following Kreps (1979), I attempt to show that preferences for flexibility capture agents’ interest of maintaining their power to shape their lives in due course.	Carlo Ludovico Cordasco

Critically, Rawls rejects public choice analysis of the democratic process on the grounds that it underestimates the capacity of political actors to deliberate about a common good, the practice of public reason. Rawls’ belief that public choice assumes selfish political actors reflects an ambiguity in Buchanan’s work between thick and thin conceptions of homo economicus. This paper reconciles public reason with the public choice framework by introducing the concept of the constitutional point of view, as distinct from the moral point of view. The moral point of view is that of the ‘impartial spectator’ judging the appropriateness of agent behaviour from a neutral standpoint. The constitutional point of view is the way an impartial spectator judges the rulesthat guide agent behaviour. This perspective is constitutive both of public choice and public reason.	Nick Cowen

By this I mean not only that the tradition has often ignored the special status of children within political communities, but that one dominant strand of this tradition has excluded children from membership in their countries of birth. In this paper, I trace the history of this model of children’s political status (which I call “the apolitical child”) to the writings of John Locke. This conception explicitly challenged the traditional vision of children as citizens of their respective political communities. Although it served to weaken the authority of absolutist monarchs over subjects born within their territories, Locke’s bold claim that children are not in fact citizens of any regime has limited the horizons of social contract theorizing, particularly with respect to education policy. In showing the radical nature of Locke’s move and its limitations, I aim to clear the way for a richer involvement with education by liberal social contract theorists.	Alexandra Oprea

We demonstrate that we can fulfil the principle by incorporating reciprocity into the basic structure of society and showing its appropriate embodiment in external increasing returns in line with the tradition of neoclassical economic theory, which is the exact mechanism described by Rawls (1971, 2001). Our model yields an intuition and an interpretation of the principle by showing its implementation in the market equilibrium. Moreover, it will show that the utilitarian principle which orders to maximize the total (average) utility stipulates the allocation where advantaged people monopolize all of wealth as just state of society. We also discuss the social and political conditions necessary for the difference principle to be stable and sustained.	Takashi Suzuki

The entire political philosophy developed by Arendt in that text relies particularly on ancient western history. Added to the spatial dimension is the factor of time when considered with the conditions prevailing in the twenty-first century. The work’s major limitation is that ever since the text was written, the public sphere in the West and in the developing world has undergone a phenomenal expansion. . Thanks to the development of digital technologies and various media fora, such as the social media. In this context this paper revisits the text ‘The Human Condition’ both from the perspective of a developing country, such as India; and secondly from the stand point of the twenty-first century and attempts to offer a critical appreciation of the work.

A deliberative and effective democracy is conditional upon accurate factual claims that often have their origin in the private sphere. Privacy describes the condition of being in control over access to information about oneself, data-mining undermines this. This triggers a debate about what we should be allowed to keep to ourselves and what the public has a right or need to know. How much privacy should an individual enjoy in a democratic state? There is a conceptual difference between different kinds of private information. While the way you dress is usually not of collective concern, the income that needs to be taxed is. Also, there is a difference between sharing information with your neighbor or with the state only. In this paper, I am arguing for a semi-private sphere where we need to give up elements of privacy for the effectiveness of the state and keep some of it to shape our interpersonal relationships. I intend to demarcate this semi-private sphere by looking at the public function of privately generated information.	Arno Stirnimann

On the one hand, theorizing e-government, e-participation, etc. rarely treats the nature of democratic agency as contested, targeting the disruptive, emancipatory potential of digital innovation instead. On the other hand, intellectual debates on the crisis of representative democracy and advent of the ‘post-political’ criticize techno-managerial governance but hardly delve deeper into issues of the autonomy and power of rising global digital intermediators. I argue that this is a crucial issue for the political theory in the digital age and ask: how can we conceptualize the (post-)political agency of Google? Since that is an emerging debate with no authoritative answer yet, I, firstly, focus on the idea of a ‘technical code’ in the critical theory of technology (Feenberg, 2002; Beira, Feenberg, 2018), and, secondly, apply it as a theoretical lens to sort out, discuss and compare answers on the issue in the most prominent analytical work across disciplines.

International institutions like IOM set global agenda basing on libertarian interpretation of migration processes – on human rights, citizenship and ethical problems of moral asymmetry between immigration and emigration. Their adversaries’ arguments deal with the right of self-determination, cultural security, preservation of welfare state and democracy which is bedding on domestic social justice. Broadly speaking it is an opposition between methodological individualism and communitarism. The essence of discussion concentrates on rights/ duties of incoming/receiving societies and moral/monetary price for exclusion and national sovereignty in globalist era. The theory of migration was mostly focused on normative and ethical issues and not very much related with the issues of political cultures, political regimes, political institutions.Thus we need the normative theory of migration which would be about political issues. For that reason we’ll try to develop the argumentation about the mutual impact of migration and three megatrends of world politics: globalization, democratization and integration not forgetting that they all now are on decline.

It reveals that democracy and liberalism are not the same thing – and they can oppose one another. In such cases, a decision is required: which set of constitutional commitments takes priority, liberalism or democracy? Is the source of legitimacy the guarantee of the right of the people to freely determine its interests — no matter what the content of those interests happens to be? Or is it checks on governmental power (even that of a majority), which take the form of guaranteed individual civil liberties and a system of checks and balances among institutions? I defend the latter. It leads liberal democrats to the constitutional form called constrained democracy. Constrained democracy conceives of democratic legal procedures as a superstructure resting on a foundational constitutional commitment to liberal values like individual liberty. I conclude by discussing two mechanisms of constrained democracy and their legitimacy: eternity clauses and party bans.	Benjamin Schupmann

What remains under-explored, however, is the flip side of disadvantage: privilege. Political privilege can be seen as the status enjoyed by social actors whose preferences and voices are given priority in the political process, often prior to, and outside the competitive electoral process. How they achieve this status is a question that brings back three pathologies of the political process: corruption, clientelism, and campaign financing as lobbying. With this paper, I am building an 'exchange model of politics' to understand privilege, recasting Dahl's pluralist model of democracy and Bueno de Mesquita’s ‘selectorate theory’. I claim that bias and privilege generate three tiers of democratic citizenship: the disadvantaged ‘subdemos’, the enfranchised ‘citizenry’ and the privileged ‘preselectorate’. The paper conceptualises the notion of political privilege and theorises its implications for democratic representation and public policy, with reference to the literatures on substantive representation, corruption, clientelism, campaign financing and lobbying.

Yet, there has been notable lack of political attention to the limitations of current models of democratic representation. While there are innovations in terms of national deliberative assemblies, descriptive representation of women and quotas, the key question of how voice is represented is neglected. In this paper, I argue in favour of discursive deliberation as a necessary institutional innovation in the context of intractable policy issues, populist politics, and the exponential rate of technological development. The case presented in this paper focuses on discursive representation at a local level in Dublin, Ireland. It reports on an investigation of discourses on the expansion of Dublin Airport as part of a public consultation in preparation of the Airport Local Area Plan. The paper presents the findings, the impact of the discourses on the Draft Plan, as well as on the representative process. The paper concludes with implications for discursive deliberative at the local democracy level and an outline of further research questions on bridging discursive representation and randomly selected assemblies.

Electoral democracies suffer from well-known problems with widespread high levels of voter ignorance. Most voters are ignorant and irrational regarding political matters and, left unchecked, their ill-informed political preferences are converted into sub-optimal policy by accommodating representatives. Proponents of epistocracy claim that modifying our political institutions to reduce the political power of comparatively ignorant citizens (or amplify the political power of comparatively well-informed citizens) is one plausible way to ameliorate the deficiencies of democracy. In this paper, I offer a critique of the purported instrumental benefits of epistocratic arrangements on empirical grounds. I argue that proponents of epistocracy oversimplify the connection between voter policy preferences and eventual policy outcomes. More importantly, they ignore several important sources of sub-optimal policies. In addition, I argue that epistocratic reforms face difficulties in addressing voter ignorance and voter irrationality. I close by considering several amendments to epistocratic proposals that render the view both instrumentally and non-instrumentally more attractive.	Adam Gibbons

I consider three accounts of democratic legitimacy that have received significant attention in recent decades: i) fairness, ii) instrumentalism, and iii) participation. On the basis of any of these three values, one might raise the legitimation objection to sortition: sortition lacks the requisite value that leads to legitimacy, and so is normatively deficient as a democratic institution. In reply to the legitimation objection, I argue that sortition can realize all three conceptions of legitimacy to the same degree that electoral institutions can. The intrinsic fairness of lottery-based selection allows sortition to achieve legitimacy on the fairness conception. Recent analyses of the epistemic advantages of randomly constructed assemblies provide us with reason to believe that sortition can provide significant social benefit, answering the instrumentalism conception of the objection. Lastly, I argue that any kind of participation which is unique to electoral institutions can be translated to sortition, settling the participatory version of the legitimation objection.

The paper focuses on Helene Landemore’s (2013) distinction between ‘counting’ and ‘talking’ approaches and concludes that both the conceptual arguments and genealogical evidence support the aggregative (counting) approach. This suggests that sortition will need to be combined with elite information advocacy, as large randomly-selected juries can only perform an aggregative judgment role – in line with the Aristotelian argument that whereas artists and architects are the best designers of paintings and buildings, those who look at the paintings and live in the houses are the best judges of their quality.

Competing Frameworks in Public Opinion on Trade	What does the public think of when thinking about international trade? This paper argues that the public relies on a particular set of heuristics to overcome informational gaps when forming trade policy views. These heuristics draw links between foreign trade and national security that would have sounded familiar to classic mercantilist pamphleteers: nation-states conducting trade in a competitive environment comprised of friends and enemies, where gains are zero-sum, exports are to be preferred to imports, and the goal of trade is national strength (and survival) through national wealth. They are appealing because they simplify a complex economic reality while drawing on recognizable concepts and emotions related to foreign policy conflict and military contests. Our empirical design combines historical cross-national survey evidence and an original survey experiment embedded in the most recent iteration of the U.S. Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). We find that reliance on these heuristics varies across countries and is more common, though not limited to, those with limited economic and political knowledge.	Katja Kleinberg

Evidence from the 2016 US Presidential Election	The open-economy politics of trade presumes that elections, as a political institution, aggregate preferences of individual voters to resolve a salient trade cleavage in a democratic society. This presumption, despite being applied to analytical narratives of trade politics in the literature, has not been empirically tested. The 2016 US presidential election is unique in this regard; trade policy became a politically salient issue, and was treated as such during the electoral campaign. We exploit two waves of a nationally-representative panel survey conducted before and after the 2016 US presidential election to identify the effect of electoral campaigns on the change in public support for trade in general and trade agreements in particular. In contrast with the conventional wisdom, we find that the election and presidential campaigns not only aggregate preexisting individual preferences for trade, but also affect public support for trade. Our main result helps explain why political candidates continue to include trade as an electoral plank when campaigning. It also suggests that trade preferences of individual voters are more endogenous to domestic institutions and political dynamics than previously assumed.	Michael Plouffe

Evidence from the 2016 US Presidential Election	The open-economy politics of trade presumes that elections, as a political institution, aggregate preferences of individual voters to resolve a salient trade cleavage in a democratic society. This presumption, despite being applied to analytical narratives of trade politics in the literature, has not been empirically tested. The 2016 US presidential election is unique in this regard; trade policy became a politically salient issue, and was treated as such during the electoral campaign. We exploit two waves of a nationally-representative panel survey conducted before and after the 2016 US presidential election to identify the effect of electoral campaigns on the change in public support for trade in general and trade agreements in particular. In contrast with the conventional wisdom, we find that the election and presidential campaigns not only aggregate preexisting individual preferences for trade, but also affect public support for trade. Our main result helps explain why political candidates continue to include trade as an electoral plank when campaigning. It also suggests that trade preferences of individual voters are more endogenous to domestic institutions and political dynamics than previously assumed.	Michael Plouffe

Existing research points to economic dislocation, sociotropic judgments, and status threats to explain mass protectionist attitudes, but neglects a key factor that has been central to campaign rhetoric: nativism. With nationally representative survey data from the U.S. and UK, we first introduce a new latent measure for globalization attitudes and show that nativism predicts negative beliefs about globalization’s effects – even among people who espouse a strong free market ideology. Second, we analyze the results of a survey experiment to show that while giving people information about the long-term national benefits of free trade decreases protectionism on average, the treatment effect weakens among more nativist Americans.

If Americans previously lacked information about the link between trade and economic circumstances, the information should lead to greater certainty about their preferences for trade protection and greater ability to hold politicians accountable for trade policy. Alternatively, it is possible that even with greater certainty about benefits from trade, trade preferences are not important enough for voters to hold politicians accountable. To test the impact of increased information on accountability, I fielded a survey to 1000 representative U.S. potential voters which gathered information concerning American beliefs about the benefits of trade and their preferences for trade protection. To observe respondents’ willingness to hold President Trump accountable for his trade-related campaign promises, a survey experiment varied the description of President Trump’s negotiation with China. As predicted by an information-based hypothesis, respondents were less likely to answer “don’t know' than in prior years. However, the survey showed little correlation between trade preferences and support for the President’s trade policy, suggesting that despite increased information, trade-based accountability remains low.

But public understanding of existing levels of taxation and expenditure is poor, making it difficult to measure views on the resulting trade-offs. We use widely-distributed UK taxpayer summaries as the baseline for a conjoint experiment assessing these trade-offs in the public mind. We make two innovations in this paper. On the substantive side, we vary both changes in spending across different areas of the budget and overall changes to the tax bill. This allows us to investigate trade-offs not only between spending in different policy areas, but also between spending increases (decreases) and tax hikes (cuts). Methodologically, our approach differs from conventional conjoint experiments in using continuous rather than categorical treatments. Rather than pre-defining a limited number of tax and spending changes, the changes we present are random draws from continuous probability distributions over a range of internally consistent trade-offs. This allows for us to estimate public support for various budget profiles with greater flexibility.	Lucy Barnes, Jack Blumenau

One strategy incumbents can employ to improve the likelihood to get reelected is to distort fiscal policy. A partisan political budget cycle occurs when incumbents increase the provision of public goods to their likely supporters before elections (financed either through higher deficits or increased taxes). At the same time, if voters are fiscally conservative, they prefer governments who improve their economic welfare without increasing debt or the taxes. In this paper, we propose that, when facing institutional and structural constraints, governments do engage in what we call “partisan political budget cycles.” Using OECD National Accounts data, we show that when constraints are high (1) government partisan differences do not affect aggregate spending or deficits, but, more importantly (2) they do affect the composition of budgets in a partisan way.

How the EU countries balanced income equality and national wealth between 2007 and 2016.	The paper develops an original framework in which fiscal policy mixes shape four 'fiscal worlds' characterized by a special balance between income equality and national wealth. A fiscal policy mix biased toward regulation generates an uneven/well-off fiscal world and motivates low-income groups to mobilize for redistribution. If narrow-sighted policymakers react by implementing redistributive policies for short-term consumption, national economy moves toward the even/badly-off fiscal world. If policymakers react through distributive policies, economic downturn matches with higher income inequality, leading to the uneven/badly-off fiscal world. Only one fiscal world positively combines income equality and national wealth and asks farsighted policymakers to adopt redistributive policies for investments. This framework is tested through a mixed method approach (QCA and mainstream econometrics). We map EU countries' membership to the four fiscal worlds over the last decade by developing a new set-theoretic indicator. Then, we identify the conjunctions of fiscal policy tools (taxation, spending and regulation) that explain countries' membership to a given fiscal world and the role played by economic strain and political disaffection in explaining countries' shifts.
