Is the Swiss parliament undergoing a trend of specialization?	What strategies push members of parliament (MPs) to engage in different political topics?In Switzerland, the federal parliament started as a lay parliament, where working full-time as an MP was very uncommon. However, the Swiss parliament has undergone a recent wave of professionalization, where MPs have increasingly more resources available to fulfil their parliamentary duties. Thus, we ask which strategies MPs choose to follow when choosing how to allocate their resources within their parliamentary work: Do they decide to focus on specializing on a few select topics when they submit parliamentary bills? If so, can we observe a trend of specialization of MPs in the Swiss parliament? We focus on all legislative bills sponsored (introduced) by MPs from the 47th to 50th legislative period (2003-2019), from which we extract the respective topics.These insights enable us to cover further relevant questions, for instance, whether specialized MPs are more successful in getting their bills passed in the parliament, or how these choices play into collaboration dynamics in parliament.

This paper is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attention by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time. We answer this question using the case of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan, and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from 1993 to 2020. We estimate the position of each legislator on the left-right dimensions using the keywords extracted from the questions that legislators request for information on policies and activities of ministries from executive officials. We document how the electoral reform shapes legislators' ideological position and variability on their issue attention: party cohesion increases when high variability in issue attention in Single Member District (SMD) and decreases when low variability under Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV).

They do so, by using a variety of strategies of disruption, which violate parliamentary rules and norms. These include provocation of other speakers, the use of offensive language and, even, violence. This paper examines the use of strategies of disruption and the responses of legislators of mainstream parties to these violations of parliamentary rules, distinguishing between neglect, counter-provocation and moral outrage. Using evidence from the 19th legislative period of the Bundestag, we document that electoral considerations explain the incentives of legislators from mainstream parties to engage in provocation or counterprovocation.

This procedural arrangement allows the executive to control the parliamentary timetable, with important consequences for the conduct and outcomes of legislative politics. Much existing literature has thus tried to understand why legislators would vote to empower the executive in this way. We explore this puzzle further by studying a major procedural milestone in the UK House of Commons: the 1902 ‘Balfour reforms’ which cemented the executive’s control of the parliamentary timetable. Combining a novel procedural dataset with historic roll-call data, we assess which factors made legislators more or less likely to support these reforms. The analysis reveals interesting patterns of inter-party and intra-party variation. We thus shed light on this important historical episode, and on the wider question of how agenda control is shaped in democratic parliaments.

Can economic incentives ‘transform’ MPs' votes?	Can economic incentives affect the voting behavior of policymakers? Using newly col-lected data on 427 confidence votes in the Italian Parliament between 2001-2022, I study the impact of a minimum tenure requirement of 4.5 years to obtain a parliamentary pension introduced in 2008. Using a difference-in-discontinuities design, I find that the policy increases the probability of voting confidence in the government by 3 percentage points. The reform increases confidence votes by majority MPs, whereas it decreases confidence votes by opposition MPs. These results confirm the predictions of a simple political-agency model in which policymakers have opportunistic motives. Beyond the direct incentive to keep the current government in power, the policy increases party loyalty: it induces opposition (majority) MPs to vote against (for) the government so as to increase the probability of being re-elected and reach the tenure requirement in a second term in case the government falls. Overall, tenure requirements for parliamentary benefits appear to increase government stability but also to increase the probability MPs vote against voters’ interest.

Binary logit and probit models already appear elusive to may researchers, not the least because of their intrinsic non-linearity. Even more elusive are models of responses with more than two categories. Here the values and, possibly, the statistical significance of coefficients depend on the choice of the baseline category of the response. To address this, a recent paper published in Political Analysis recommends to look at the statistical significance of differences in probabilities rather than the statistical significance of individual coefficients. I argue that such a recommendation does not help with practitioners' confusion about these models as it conflates inference with interpretation. I further show that there are established techniques of inferences in the statistician's toolbox that avoid such conflation. Third, I show that probability changes always occur if any of the coefficients in a multinomial logit model are non-zero. Finally, I present a sequential logit model that allows for some of the response probabilities to remain constant while others vary with the values of independent variables.

Is the US a democracy? Does Nigeria have a strong legislature? Increasingly, researchers are turning to latent variable approaches to answer these questions. The upside is great as the barriers to data and computational capacity are steadily declining. The downside is that these approaches render the concept structure a black box. Researchers know the input and perhaps even the statistical model producing the classification scores, yet they cannot communicate the resulting concept structure. Focusing on the Item Response Theory (IRT) approach to concept measurement, we offer a way to communicate what is in the black box. We argue that the items’ weights produced by IRT can be mapped onto notions of necessary and sufficient conditions traditionally used to communicate concept structure. In so doing, we show how IRT and traditional approaches can be integrated to deal with the challenging task of assigning cases to concepts.

Included variables are particularly a problem in the analysis of disparate impact cases—situations where race-neutral policies create racially disparate outcomes. Ayres notes that social scientists have yet to develop theory with which to describe this bias. I provide such a theory drawing on the literature on overadjustment. I then compare and assess through simulations various statistical solutions including outcomes tests and risk-adjusted regression.

Here, we examine claims of fraud in the presidential election of 2020 that are based on aggregate election data, and we further limit ourselves to claims in which the data itself is essentially undisputed. We show that the implications of that data for the presence of massive fraud have been largely or entirely misinterpreted through invalid statistical or logical reasoning. Our goal is not to provide new insights, since virtually all the points we make have been made by others, but rather to put together in one place a compendium of recent glaring misuses of statistical inference in a form that we believe will be useful as a teaching tool about the dangers of sloppy use of statistics.

This approach assumes researchers can identify and measure the main variables that can confound a given relation of interest. We check how much agreement there is in the variables that are identified as potential confounders. We focus on relationships often tested in political science and identify the control variables used by each paper that tests it. We start with reporting how much overlap there is, on average, within papers testing each relationship. Then, we move to the question of whether this overlap is consequential. To that end, we check how much the results change if one were to run the analyses of one paper using the controls of other papers within the sample drawing upon the same empirical relationship. Finally, we provide some suggestions to improve subsequent practice–namely, showing that one’s results hold regardless of the constellations of controls used, and the replication of one’s findings using the constellation of controls by previous papers.

When censorship blocks the audience's access to the independent media in an authoritarian regime, censorship induces global media polarization. In this situation, audiences under authoritarianism are influenced by propaganda and choose to support its regime. Meanwhile, the independent media tends to misreport the information about the authoritarian regime, because its reputation concern is overshadowed by the ideological concern. When the authoritarian regime adopts different propaganda strategies for domestic and foreign audiences, audiences under authoritarianism receive the least truthful information. By contrast, audiences in the liberal world receive more reliable information about the authoritarian regime.

We argue that, when property rights are endogenous to markets, that set of property rights is either not attainable or requires a balanced power distribution in society. More generally, we analyze a formal model where we vary the underlying market structure—the degree to which agents depend on each other’s efforts to produce economic value—and characterize property rights that emerge in equilibrium. We argue that distribution and efficiency problems are inseparable and optimal property rights tend to function as balancers of power disparities, instead of their common interpretation as equidistant formal institutions.

We contend that the decision to purge the elite and the breadth of a mass purge of agents are closely intertwined and crucially depend on how closely connected are new hires to the elite in place. If this connection is low so that the autocrat has good control of the hiring process, good performance is not always sufficient to save the elite. As the autocrat starts purging the elite, she carries out a smaller mass purge. Mass purges are, therefore, mostly used to dissuade a disloyal incumbent elite.

We contend that the decision to purge the elite and the breadth of a mass purge of agents are closely intertwined and crucially depend on how closely connected are new hires to the elite in place. If this connection is low so that the autocrat has good control of the hiring process, good performance is not always sufficient to save the elite. As the autocrat starts purging the elite, she carries out a smaller mass purge. Mass purges are, therefore, mostly used to dissuade a disloyal incumbent elite. In contrast, if the connection between agent and the elite is high, so that the latter controls the hiring process, the elite can survive poor performance. As the autocrat starts purging the elite, the breadth of the mass purge increases. Mass purges become a tool to dissuade a disloyal replacement elite.

Why would the regime purchase coalitions that far exceed the bare majority required? I develop a model of legislative vote-buying in a dictatorship with secret bribes and uncertainty about legislator preferences. The dictator values resources and policy control. Legislators' incentive to accept an offered bribe depends on their expectation that their vote is pivotal. Revealed votes in one period influence these expectations in the next. In the absence of an attempted bribe, they vote their true preferences. Revealed legislative dissent increases the dictator's cost for bribing individual legislators and raises the probability that his proposals will fail in future. Offering even a small bribe to all participants is sufficient under most conditions to disrupt legislative collective action. The results suggest coalitional over-buying is worthwhile even in scenarios where the regime experiences hegemonic support. """"""""Rubber-stamp"""""""" legislatures may therefore reflect regime strategic behavior rather than the state of nature.

However, only some new parties have stood the test of time. This paper seeks to explain the factors associated with the origin and resilience of new parties in political instability and social mobilization contexts, addressing the case of the Chilean Frente Amplio. This research presents a comparative study of the trajectories of the Frente Amplio's new parties through a process tracing methodology structured on semi-structured interviews with party leaders' data. The resilience shown by the Chilean Frente Amplio is explained by its origin in the 2011 student movement, which allowed the development of networks, recruitment of leaders, and a sense of common belonging. None of these elements are present in the rest of the emerging parties in Chile. By including an under-studied case from Latin America, we seek to expand the literature on emerging parties to new regions and social contexts.

A Comparative Analysis	Several studies show how institutions, the party system and the related distribution of power influence the capacities and incentives of parties to promote their policy preferences. However, they rarely observe how the macroeconomic conditions in which parties are called to act can play a role in this process too. To fill this gap, this paper investigates how the economic performance of a country affects the policymaking process and the party-policy linkage. More specifically, this study focuses on economic crises to test whether parties are still able to fulfil their election promises even during an economic downturn. I argue that the interaction between policymaking and economic context seems to be more multifaceted than it is often represented and cannot be restricted to the financial constraints generated by a recession. The economic recession might also open up new opportunities and give parties new incentives, not least electoral ones, to carry out their policy proposals. I investigate this topic using data on pledge fulfilment in ten European countries. This allows exploring how economic circumstances have a similar/different impact on institutionally different countries.

Meanwhile, it is argued that neoliberal reforms have strengthened the control over the bureaucracy, thus increasing its politicization. Previous studies have mainly focused on bureaucratic politicization defined as political intervention in the personnel decisions of civil service, but as Aberbach et al (1981) suggest, another dimension of bureaucratic politicization includes civil servants’ participation in political activities. In this study, we explore this dimension of bureaucratic politicization through the concept of 'administratification of politics' based on a South Korean case in which a group of former officials became members of the National Assembly. With their policy expertise and bureaucratic networks, these politicians would play a significant role in policymaking under democratization and neoliberal reform. Consequently, former bureaucrat legislators will influence policy-making and augment bureaucratic politicization. From 1948 to the present, we collected a database of National Assembly members in South Korea with profiles to reveal changes in the pattern of 'administratification of politics' over time.

It explores this argument by studying the effects of a reform that dramatically increased the jurisdictional size of some Danish local governments. Constructing a panel of granular data on housing permits issued by these local governments, I identify the effect of this reform using a set of difference-in-difference models. I find that in areas where jurisdiction size increased local governments issued markedly fewer permits for market rate housing, especially in municipalities which experienced a large decrease in inter-jurisdictional competition and tax-base-volatility. These findings should give pause to anyone who hopes to ameliorate the affordability crisis by centralising power over land use policy.

Focusing on two major pillars of private regulation, international standards setting and public-private initiatives, we argue that companies that are in favour of more public regulation as well as those that actively manage their supply chains engage more with international private standard setting bodies. We find empirical support for these expectations. Moreover, our results show that both factors reinforce each other. This enables us to discriminate empirically between two competing rationales for corporate engagement with private standard setters: regulation seeking, and the pre-emption of costly public regulation. Our findings lend support to the former: firms engage with private standard setters for the same reasons that they favour regulation more generally.

We employ a difference-in-differences design to assess how the reform affected party and voter behavior. The findings suggest that parties did not select or prioritize more young candidates in trial municipalities. However, voters gave young candidates significantly higher shares of preference votes and elected them at higher rates in the trial municipalities. The article contributes to the literature on political selection and provides evidence that enfranchisement not only increases groups’ voting participation but may as well increase their political representation.

Some explain this by pointing at national-level cultural and institutional factors. Others emphasize the role parties’ characteristics play in facilitating women’s representation. Specifically, scholars contend that candidate selection methods affect female representation. Such work usually refers to the descriptive dimension of women’s representation. However, representing women is also the extent to which women-related issues are addressed. This paper examines whether the type of intra-party candidate selection method affects the amount of discourse party members (whether men or women) dedicate to women-related issues. We explore whether the candidate selection method not only affects the descriptive representation of women but improves their substantive representation. Using a computational method, we analyze a dataset comprising all national-level aspiring politicians’ Facebook posts during four election campaigns of the Israeli Parliament. Our analysis indicates an overall gap in issue attention between different selection methods. Results show that a more inclusive (rather than exclusive) method is correlated with greater women’s substantive representation.

How MP's side jobs influence the content of parliamentary questions	It is controversial whether MP’s side jobs can create conflicts of interest or even corruption. This leads to the question of the overall legitimacy of side jobs. While parliamentary behavior and policy priorities enjoy considerable attention in political science, the influence of side jobs on these subjects is underresearched. We aim to address this research gap by providing sociological and rational explanations on how side jobs can intrinsically and extrinsically influence the motivation to prioritize specific issues. In our analysis, we focus on the content of all written parliamentary questions asked in the German Bundestag (2013-2021). By employing a difference-in-difference design, we investigate how changes in MPs' side jobs lead to changes in the focus of the parliamentary questions they ask. The results have both societal and scientifically relevant implications. First, they contribute to the debate on the effect of side jobs on parliamentary behavior. Second, in analyses of legislative behavior, it is important to consider the extent to which side jobs represent an alternative to existing theoretical models and how they might confound other explanatory variables.

A Comparison of Young and Old MPs’ Speeches in the German Bundestag	In recent debates about political representation descriptive representation has gained more and more attention. The fact that many parliaments are not a good mirror of society has sparked public and scientific discussion about the underrepresentation of certain groups. But how strong is the effect of descriptive representation on substantive representation? Research results so far are mixed. In this paper, we focus on young people, a historically underrepresented group characterized by distinct interests and preferences. With a novel data set of topics and positions taken by MPs in more than 72,000 speeches given in 23 years of plenary debates in the German Bundestag, we examine how young MPs' speeches differ in terms of topics and ideological position. We find significant differences in the salience young and old MPs devote to certain topics. Positional differences, on the other hand, can be solely explained by party ideology. These results suggest that descriptive representation matters in particular for the issues discussed in parliament. Yet, once these issues are on the table, MPs tend to follow the party line, irrespective of their group membership.

Examining legislative speech-making in the early part of equal franchise	There is a vast literature on legislative speech-making by women. Most of these studies focus on modern parliamentary settings. In this paper we focus on whether patterns of legislative speech-making by women are established from the outset when the franchise is extended to women or whether it develops over time. We explore this question by focusing on Denmark 1918-1939. Women were first elected to the upper and lower chambers of the Danish Parliament in 1918. Legislation had to pass both chambers allowing us to use the variation in whether women speak on a topic in just one of the chambers, in both chambers or does not speak at all on the topic. We analyse the question by examining the number and content of speeches. We also use debate records to conduct a quantitative text analysis of speech-making. Our findings suggest that the patterns of legislative speech-making by women takes time to develop and that the differences found might be partisan instead of exclusively gendered.

IIGOs are believed to be primarily interstate talk shops which are beneficial because they are ‘low-cost’ institutions and better able to secure information and confidentiality. Accordingly, we might expect IIGOs to share a key feature: the exclusion of transnational actors (TNAs). Yet, a cursory look at IIGOs reveals that they vary in the extent to which they provide opportunities for the participation of TNAs. This paper examines this variation, asking: under what circumstances are IIGOs likely to be closed to TNAs? Theoretically, it posits that the political costs of inclusion, TNA resources, and the institutional environment affect whether IIGO are open or closed to TNAs. Empirically, we present new data on TNA access to 94 IIGOs and examine the variation in IIGO openness. We also illustrate how political costs, TNA resources, and the institutional environment affected the Australia Group’s inclusion of TNAs. Our findings have implications for debates on the rise of informal institutions and the openness of global governance.

Critics warn that earmarked funding undermines the autonomy of IOs and the quality of their operations.

We then test these hypotheses through a novel elite survey experiment with staff from 6 UN organizations (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA). Our study provides important insights for emerging debates on the resourcing of IOs and broader study of the motivations of international bureaucrats.

Crises may exacerbate pressures, potentially affecting functions, performance, and legitimacy, and even result in outright dissolution. While some IOs cope well with crises, others seem to struggle. This paper aims to explain that variation by inductively mapping out an analytical framework on the role of leading institutional actors during crises, opening new avenues for IO research. Relying primarily on over 50 interviews with IO officials, state representatives, and experts, the paper’s case studies apply its leadership framework to the crisis-response processes of three IOs: 1) the World Trade Organization's handling of the Appellate Body crisis, 2) the World Bank's strategies for navigating the rise of alternative development institutions, 3) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's adaptation to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The findings highlight the often-neglected role of institutional leaders in handling challenges, their reliance on limited but crucial institutional tools, resources, and competences, as well as the specific context of the crisis they navigate.

The Influence of Personality Traits on Bureaucratic Attitudes and Norms	Why are some public servants more professional than others? To answer this question, I focus on the interactions between citizens and bureaucrats grounded in psychology and political economy. In nexus with these perspectives, I aim to study how personality traits influence bureaucratic professionalism and how these traits interact with institutional and cultural legacies. Further, I propose that personality traits will matter differently in different institutional contexts. For instance, we can agree that narcissistic personalities will be more prone to corruption — but only some institutional settings will encourage narcissistic personalities to engage in corrupt activities. This research project, therefore, aims to deepen the understanding of how the specifics of cultural and developmental contexts influence professional behaviour. I intend to employ an experiment fielded in Italy using measures of personality traits, including the Big-Five Model and the Dark Triad of Personality: to evaluate the interaction between institutional environments and personality traits, and in turn, its influence on bureaucratic professionalism.

While the field is heavily developed in the U.S., several recent literature reviews have shown the scarcity of empirical work in other settings, and particularly, the lack of cross-country comparative studies. This article uses the multidimensional Index of Bureaucratic Underrepresentation to show time-series patterns on the historically disadvantaged groups that are most (least) excluded from public administrations in 36 European countries. The index covers five dimensions: gender, ethnicity, nationality, age and disability. The article proposes a typology to characterize the different clusters of countries and develops grounded theory to explain the stark contrasts found in terms of level and types of exclusions. The theory highlights inertial aspects related to administrative traditions (Painter and Peters 2010), as well as more contingent aspects associated to the idea of Public Service Bargains (Hood and Lodge 2006). The findings aim to contribute to an under-researched field of political science and invite discussion on

First, identifying the causal effect of public sector culture on honest behavior; and the lack of behavioral evidence on the honesty of public sector workers in the context of collaboration. To address the first challenge we take advantage of the relationship between culture and identity and the possibility of selectively prime identity (Cohn et al., 2014).

Previous research has highlighted the relationships between agency politicization and turnover (as well as other career outcomes), yet—with the notable exceptions of ideology and public service motivation—no large-scale study has examined how individual differences affect the relationship between the politicization of individual bureaucrats’ work environments and their career decisions, broadly speaking. Here, using a new survey of almost 2000 U.S. federal employees, we examine how individual traits (e.g., personality, authoritarianism, economic preferences over time and money, ideology, public service motivation, etc.) affect the relationship between agency politicization and individual morale, job satisfaction, and other outcome variables of interest. Our results show that these traits affect the extent to which structural political variables affect career outcomes, and are also influential in and of themselves. Results are instructive for both practitioners as well as scholars of bureaucratic politics, political psychology, and public administration.

Leveraging big data from Spain	The selection model and career incentives of public administrators matters greatly for the performance of a bureaucracy. It affects the quality-of-service provision, the magnitude of waste, and the capacity to innovate. In this paper we leverage massive micro-level administrative data to illuminate key questions about the degree of meritocracy and politicization in the selection and career advancement of civil servants. Focusing on the higher bodies of the Spanish bureaucracy, we have extracted massive data from the Spanish Official State Bulletin to trace the career trajectories of all civil servants from four elite bureaucratic corps. These comprehensive data allow us to analyze the successes and limitations of Weberian selection systems, the mechanisms of the politicization of the civil service, and the progress and obstacles to the diversification of bureaucracies (particularly with regards to gender, disability, and class). In so doing, the paper will contribute to policy and societal debates about the civil service, its representativeness, and its autonomy from the political sphere.

He also claims that most European countries can no longer be called “nations”, since they adopt multiculturalism and “mixed race” practices. Similar arguments are made by illiberal nationalist politicians across Europe. Starting from the position that nationhood is not an ethnodemographic fact but a political claim – to people’s loyalty and their solidarity – I will examine some different ways in which the claim to nationhood bolsters the agenda of far-right conservatives in a range of European settings. What do contemporary nationalists in Europe mean when they claim to speak in the name of the nation? What is the purpose of promoting a state that is of and for a putative nation? What do the differences and similarities in the nationalist idiom across Europe tell us about nationalism and its role in contemporary politics? I will address these normative questions in the context of contemporary practice in Europe, primarily in Hungary, Italy and Sweden.

However, existing research lacks comprehensive assessment on the individual level whether the Commission is successful with its engagement. The core goal is to foster future cooperation among European people of various cultural sectors under a common framework. In theoretical manners, this process is related to identity formation, socialization and transnational cooperation. Apart from the cultural operators’ individual motivations to participate in the European funding programs and set up cooperation with foreign partners, the long-term sustainability of the Union’s policy engagement is targeted. The analysis follows a mixed-methods design combining semi-structured interviews with systematic coding of the arguments and their quantitative analysis. The interviews differentiate between three groups of cultural operators: People registered in European cultural platforms, which indicates their general interest to engage in European-wide processes (1), people explicitly looking for project partners to apply for funding (2) and people who are already conducting a project or complete one soon (3).

How can governments intent on signing such agreements convince the public that these costs are worth bearing? To examine this question, we examine how framing the consequences of cooperation and the consequences of not cooperating affects public attitudes. In light of well-known biases in people’s decision-making, we argue that framing cooperation as a potential gain, or its absence as a potential loss, influences voters’ willingness to embrace international cooperation. We analyze two pre-registered survey experiments, fielded in three countries, concerning different international negotiations. Contrary to expectations about people’s loss aversion, our results show that framing the lack of cooperation as a loss substantially reduces support among opponents of the agreement, whereas highlighting potential gains increases overall support. These findings have broader implications for our understanding of the (lack of) persuasiveness of elite endorsements, especially with regard to the backlash to “project fear” campaigns, and carry important practical advice for advocates of international cooperation.

Keeping voting rights in  the United Nations General Assembly	Member states of the United Nations may lose their voting rights due to the non-payment of dues, which according to Coggins and Morse (2022) is the cause for a large share of the absences in roll called votes. While the rules for losing the voting rights are quite clear, namely having failed to pay in full the dues for two consecutive years, not all laggards/defaulters lose their voting rights, as the Committee on Contributions has some leeway in proposing which member states should lose these right (a decision, ultimately made by the United Nations General Assembly itself). Drawing on a complete set of decisions on voting rights withdrawals, it can be shown that these decisions are not free from political influence. These initial results suggest that withdrawls of voting rights need to be studied in more detail and their political nature being taken into account when analyzing voting records, particularly absences.

I contribute to this body of research and focus on an overlooked way IOs can affect the general public: by influencing attitudes of people who live in a close proximity to the specific place and time of their institutional meetings. International meetings increase salience of the discussed issue in the local community that hosts them by organising events, by engaging with local political authorities, and by attracting initiatives from other interested social actors: non-governmental organisations, media sources, and protestors. I test this argument by analyzing the Conference of the Parties’ (COP) effect on people’s environmental preferences in the regions they took place. I identify COP’s local effects by applying a staggered difference-in-differences design on bi-yearly waves of Eurobarometer time-series cross-sectional data (2002–2022). I corroborate this large-N evidence with a case-study of Glasgow’s COP26 meeting that illustrates the mechanism. Results show that IOs do not operate in a vacuum and that their meetings can be strategic opportunities to foster issue salience.

In a survey experiment fielded to a representative sample of approximately 3,000 Americans, we manipulated the presentation of the Quad to focus on different leaders and compared respondents’ support conditional on whether the country leader was White or non-White. We find limited evidence that in the absence of strong political cues, the race of the coalition partner affects White Americans’ support for cooperation. Partisanship is a strong driver of perceptions, however, making it challenging to assess the effect of race even in an experimental setting.

Corresponding with this rise in outward investment are industrial policies, where emerging market governments use financial subsidies to incentivise their firms’ outward investments. Why are developing countries increasingly adopting policies that would shift capital outside of a capital-scarce economy? To explain this puzzle, I argue that outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) confers developmental benefits to developing economies similar to those usually fulfilled by inward FDI flows (IFDI). Developing countries that experience less success harnessing developmental benefits from IFDI are thus more likely to adopt a policy strategy of supporting OFDI. I test my theory using a mixed methods approach, combining a quantitative analysis from 84 emerging markets, as well as case studies of India and Brazil. This paper’s presents new empirical evidence demonstrating the conditions under which emerging markets use their outward investment to “leapfrog” traditional development processes. This framework highlights a new development pathway for emerging markets in the context of increased economic globalization.

For example, the pre-dominant local currency bond index, JP Morgan’s GBI-EM index, has included no more than 16 developing countries since its inception in the early 2000s. Given the influence of index inclusion on market access, we probe the conditions under which JP Morgan subjectively includes and excludes developing country sovereign bonds from the GBI-EM. We hypothesize that in addition to macroeconomic fundamentals, government partisanship and policy choices dictate whether JP Morgan includes a government’s locally-denominated debts in its index. We test for this using various hazard models. The findings have implications for the international political economy of sovereign debt and finance.

Creditors face an information asymmetry when assessing sovereign creditworthiness as borrowing governments know more about their own ability and willingness to repay. I argue that governments take advantage of this asymmetry to manipulate the information that creditors use to make lending decisions and negotiate repayment. When entering the sovereign bond market, requesting credit ratings, and issuing new bonds, governments have incentives to artificially inflate measures of economic prosperity to improve access to credit. However, when governments are unwilling to repay debts, they have incentives to """"""""plead poverty"""""""" by underestimating the resources available for repayment. Using nighttime GDP estimates, tax revenue projections, and hidden sovereign debt, I create several measures of manipulation in governments' economic and fiscal reports. I find that positive manipulation (overestimating fiscal resources) increases when governments are courting creditors, while negative manipulation (underestimating fiscal resources) increases when governments are restructuring their sovereign debt. These findings demonstrate how governments engage in financial statecraft and circumvent creditor discipline to secure advantageous credit outcomes in good times and in bad.

Why? We argue borrowing states' relationships with stronger states, particularly the United States, affect markets' perceptions of states post-default. US support repairs states' reputations faster than non-supported states. As a result, U.S.-supported states have less to fear by abandoning their debt obligations. We test our argument with a series of empirical analyses using data on debt restructuring episodes from 1975 to 2016. We find that states with stronger relationships with the United States are more likely to restructure existing debt obligations and are more likely to force large losses on investors. Yet these same states largely avoid the harsh consequences normally associated with debt restructuring. Supported states face lower borrowing costs and wait shorter periods of time to re-enter the bond market after a debt restructuring. Our argument and findings show the importance of how international factors change the incentives on how states operate in financial markets.

We focus on Productive Power and the associated strategy of “rhetorical framing”: the use of particular words or terms to characterize an issue and imply appropriate policy actions in line with that characterization. We expect rhetorical framing to be particularly important for “the weak” because it can be wielded defensively, is accessible even by very weak states, and is compatible with other strategies. To probe these expectations, we analyze negotiation transcripts from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Based on over 5,000 observations between 1995 and 2020, we confirm that rhetorical framing is 1) used to counter the strong, 2) used even by very weak states, and 3) used in conjunction with other strategies. While strong states tend to promulgate a rhetorical frame emphasizing Reciprocation (mutual concessions between states), weak states counter with an alternative rhetorical frame emphasizing Redistribution (one-way transfers from stronger states to weaker ones). Our findings make conceptual contributions, revealing how weak states’ aims and approaches differ from those of strong states.

The Potential Impact of Algorithmic Decision-Making	The increasing use of algorithmic predictions for decision-making in public policy settings is accompanied by concerns about their potential to embed biases and reinforce inequalities. Sparked by these concerns, a substantial body of literature has emerged on disparities in predicted values and predictive performances. The impact of algorithmic decision-making, however, does not only follow from the predictions. In this article, we show that the impact on inequality depends on the heterogeneity of effects of subsequent interventions and on the allocation rule. We illustrate our argument using data on programs for jobseekers in public employment services in Switzerland. By performing retrospective counterfactual impact evaluations with varying allocation rules, we show how algorithmic decision-making affects inequality in outcomes. To choose between different allocation rules, the policy maker must decide how averse to inequality the allocation should be. Our approach can help guide policymakers and inform the public debate on the impacts of algorithmic decision-making.

An experimental study on the role of performance, accountability, and embedded public service values	Solving the legitimacy gap in the digital transformation of public services is key to efficient and reliable citizen-state relationships in Western bureaucracies. In a conjoint experiment, we therefore ask three stakeholder groups; public IT managers, frontline civil servants, and citizens; how intelligent self-service chatbots for local public service should be designed. The design of the chatbot has to account for five principles; (1) safety and privacy standards, (2) accountability (human in the loop), (3) embedded values, (4) the distribution of automatization gains (citizens vs. municipality), and (5) the type of interface. The research design enables us to identify the design features that IT experts, civil servants, and citizens consider essential for solving the legitimacy gap. In the second step, we test whether respondents’ pre-existing technology attitudes and regulation preferences moderate the relative weighting of system design features. The study’s results will contribute to developing intelligent self-service chatbots for local public services that civil servants and citizens can appreciate.

Many experts and laypeople believe that digitalisation will furter increase socioeconomic inequality. The pandemic seems to have accelerated those fears. So far, we know less what politicians think and say about this, and whether such fears may have an impact on legislative dynamics. We look at German parliamentary debates before and after the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany to see whether indeed the pandemic was a watershed moment in the way the parliament invokes discussions on digitalization. Methodologically we extract important socioeconomic themes and policy fields discussed in parliamentary debates, using a topic model approach. We test whether there are visible differences between before and after the start of the covid-19 pandemic both in the salience of these themes, and in the sentiment with which parliamentarians talk about them. We find that indeed, the German parliamentary debates on digitalisation evolved, somewhat moving away from their pre-covid focus on digitalisation as mainly an issue for modernizing the economy, infrastructure or data protection, towards – at least temporarily – more concerns regarding education, the health sector, as well as social and labour policy.

We argue that there remains information loss due to common automated translation processes and that this systematically varies by the target translation language. To evaluate this argument, we measure the amount of information loss inherent to common translation approaches by comparing analysis of benchmark speaker positions estimated from unsupervised and weakly supervised scaling models in a comparative perspective. We utilize data from eight countries including five languages which are part of the ParlEE dataset. This data allows us to precisely estimate the information loss caused by the difference in linguistic families and account for the information loss compared to a monolingual, untranslated analysis for estimating policy positions.The results from this analysis hold implications for understanding the biases introduced by automated translations and therefore the limits for hypothesis testing in a comparative framework.

Party leader candidates feature prominently on social media. As potential figureheads of their party, they are often depicted by party members. While the literature extensively covers the selection processes and the democratization of these elections, actual appearance of candidates in images is still under-explored. This paper seeks to fill this gap by arguing that candidates' social media appearance is an indicator of internal political capital by providing analyses of 51560 Instagram images posted by Canadian, German and British MPs during 14 party leader elections between 2019 and 2022. Methodologically, we utilise a face recognition classifier that measures how often party leaders are depicted on MPs’ social media. This allows us to present a novel comparative large-N analysis that provides insight into parliamentarians' social media. We hypothesize that party leader appearance is driven by intra-party support rather than general public support. Our results contribute to literature on political capital in general, and on the relationship between internal and external political capital specifically.

In parliament, legislative leaders shape the fate of their party. Externally, they shape the negotiations with other parties. Internally, they structure the daily partisan activity by coordinating individual MPs. Coordination is eased by the leader's control over partisan resources. Their optimal use implies redistribution and delegation. This paper formerly and empirically investigates how leaders distribute partisan resources among their MPs. Specifically, leaders face a trade-off. They can favor ideologically close MPs and reduce moral hazards. But they can also ensure the loyalty of powerful MPs and prevent their costly defection. Using game theory and an innovative game setting, I demonstrate that the leaders’ optimal redistribution strategy depends on the intra-partisan distribution of both ideological positions and power. Most of the time, the leader can enforce the party line and reduce power inequalities. Problems arise in presence of powerful extremists, who force the leader to choose between empowering extremists, hence increasing inequalities, or facing the costly rebellion of the extremist. These power inequalities eventually translate into representation inequalities, which have broad implications for the literature on representation and policy-making.

Preference, Speech and Floor Voting Congruence	Parliamentary speeches and votes are key aspects of democratic representation, yet given potential party constraints, MPs may not accurately express their sincere preferences. This raises two key questions: To what extent do MPs express their true preferences when giving speeches in parliament? And to what extent does their subsequent voting behaviour reflect their true and expressed preferences? These questions remain understudied, and in particular, the relationship between true and expressed preferences is unexplored. We analyse a novel dataset covering four terms (2002-2018) of the Swedish Riksdag, combining four surveys with response rates of over 90%, all final votes on legislation, and the speeches given on legislation. We show the extent to which MPs are constrained by their parties in terms of expressing their preferences in debates and as well as in floor voting. We also assess the extent to which personal votes influence behaviour in the Riksdag. By comparing true and expressed preferences we are better suited than previous studies to capture the open and covert ideological differences within parties, thus advancing ongoing research on intraparty dynamics in party-centred legislatures.

Why? I hypothesize that the 'disembeddedness' of international capital from domestic politics may explain the rise of economic nationalism. By 'disembeddedness', I refer to the degree of production activity ties that firms have to a given economy. As MNCs have grown disembedded from the domestic economic policy of states, the relative bargaining power of domestic import-competing firms vis-à-vis MNCs has increased, thereby fundamentally reversing the domestic political dynamics of MNCs over the last four decades. To test this argument, I draw from an original firm-level dataset that identifies the degree of ‘disembeddedness’ and the lobbying activity of MNCs in the aftermath of the UK’s referendum on membership in the European Union (EU).

Previous research has shown that MNCs’ location decisions are shaped by host country characteristics like regime type, political stability, and partisan cycles of the national government. However, little is known about the influence of local governments in such investment decisions. This is an important topic because local governments are often directly involved with foreign investment attraction: they set up investment attraction offices, organize business missions to foreign countries, and have the legal authority to decide on the allocation of incentives and subsidies. In many countries, local authorities even engage in disputes against each other to attract a given MNC, leading to major fiscal wars. Using data on effective FDI transactions to Brazil at the firm and host municipality levels between 2011 and 2021, this paper examines whether partisanship and partisan alignment at the local, state, and national levels affect cities’ ability to attract FDI.

They can conduct so-called “inside” lobbying by directly contacting decision-makers. They can also influence public opinion - so-called “outside lobbying.” This paper shows an unexplored tension between inside lobbying and public opinion. Information on inside lobbying that reaches the public changes the public’s opinion of interest groups themselves. Inside lobbying that is misaligned with public preferences thus creates a reputational cost. As investors and consumers increasingly care about “corporate social responsibility,” companies need to be careful to preserve their reputations as good political citizens. I use two original survey experiments on climate lobbying to show that corporate lobbying affects companies’ reputations with consumers and investors. I also demonstrate that companies can preserve their public image by shifting their unpopular lobbying positions into business associations, a strategy which I call “collective irresponsibility.” I then use lobbying data from the European Union and a newly collected dataset of companies’ membership in business associations to test whether companies do shift unpopular lobbying into associations when they face pressure from consumers and investors.

Trade disputes affect access to markets and suppliers in ways that are likely to influence investment decisions. Indeed, recent work examines how multinationals influence the initiation and duration of disputes. Yet we know little about how multinationals respond to trade frictions in a world of GVCs. We argue that trade disputes can actually lead to greater inward FDI in respondent countries because a (resolved) trade dispute signals lower barriers to trade. This hurts domestic producers in the respondent and creates opportunities for multinationals in the complainant country. However, we expect that the effect of trade disputes will depend on how and to what extent the industry integrates into GVCs. In particular, we expect the impact of a dispute to be greater where there are more backward linkages, that is, in industries that rely on imported inputs. We use data on dyad-industry level greenfield FDI from FDI markets between 2003 and 2015 to test our hypotheses.

I exploit Brazil's 1990s trade liberalization episode as a source of an exogenous shock to local communities which induced worsening levels of local inequality. The resulting increase in inequality leaves local communities more exposed to the devastating effects from climate-change related disasters in later years, resulting in variegated effects conditional on the degree of trade-liberalization in the recent past. I show, in particular, that trade's disproportionate impact on low-skilled industries increases exposure to and reduces the ability to recover from climate-related events for poorer segments of communities who are often employed by impacted industries.I test these effects utilizing a common method for determining local levels of exposure to trade liberalization in Brazil combined with census microdata and a novel dataset geolocating climate-related extreme weather events.

Although targets frequently adopt economic countersanctions, we know little about what determines a target’s decision to retaliate. This article argues that while materially rich senders (sanctioning countries) can rely on their economic might to deter retaliation, relatively weak senders leverage the support of IOs to avoid countermeasures. I test the theory with a mixed methods approach. A two-way fixed effects model and an instrumental variable approach accounting for the potential endogeneity of IO support test the four arguments quantitatively. Two case studies verify the hypothesized mechanisms in the context of international environmental politics. The findings indicate that the hypothesized determinants have large effects on the likelihood of retaliation in a broad range of contexts and that the hypothesized mechanisms are observable in the two case studies. Especially the finding that IOs disproportionally benefit relatively weak senders has important implications, including for future international environmental policies aiming to achieve cooperation through the threat of economic sanctions.

We designed an economic experiment with a 2x3 factorial design to study the effectiveness of the best-known mechanisms that are supposed to foster international cooperation on climate change mitigation: climate pledges, financial penalties, and reputation. We test each of these mechanisms both separately and together. In the climate pledge treatments, participants could pledge their desired production target, approve targets by majority vote, and join the agreement. In the treatments with financial penalties, failure to meet pledges triggered monetary sanctions. In the reputation treatments, participants competed for a nonmonetary environmental prize (climate reputation) by ranking each other based on their decisions in the game. We find that most participants joined climate agreements and met their pledges, but pledges were insufficiently ambitious to curb climate change.

We designed an economic experiment with a 2x3 factorial design to study the effectiveness of the best-known mechanisms that are supposed to foster international cooperation on climate change mitigation: climate pledges, financial penalties, and reputation. We test each of these mechanisms both separately and together. In the climate pledge treatments, participants could pledge their desired production target, approve targets by majority vote, and join the agreement. In the treatments with financial penalties, failure to meet pledges triggered monetary sanctions. In the reputation treatments, participants competed for a nonmonetary environmental prize (climate reputation) by ranking each other based on their decisions in the game. We find that most participants joined climate agreements and met their pledges, but pledges were insufficiently ambitious to curb climate change. Neither pledge-and-review, competition for reputation, nor financial penalties reduced emissions. The results question the effectiveness of the mechanisms behind climate agreements and call for more effective alternatives.

Evidence from the 2012, 2017 and 2022 French Legislative Elections	In recent years, many studies (Stockemer & Sundström 2018; 2021; 2022) have highlighted the underrepresentation of the youth in the parliaments of Western democracies. Although they make up a large share of the population, few young adults win seats in their country’s legislative elections. Yet voters do not appear to have a negative bias against young candidates (Eshima and Smith 2022; McLean & Ono 2022; Roberts & Wolak 2022). This research focuses on another factor that may contribute to youth underrepresentation: the level of competitiveness of the districts in which political parties choose to nominate candidates who are under 35. Using data from the 2012, 2017, and 2022 French legislative elections, it attempts to determine whether, similarly to women (Thomas & Bodet 2013) and visible minorities (Kulich, Ryan & Haslam 2014), young adults tend to be nominated in districts that they have little or no chance of winning. Two measures of district competitiveness are used. One is ‘static’ and the other is ‘dynamic’. Results show that young people – and especially young women – are more likely than others to be ‘sacrificial lambs’.

Wealth and higher office in the United States	We introduce and seek to explain a new and surprising fact about members of the U.S. Congress: women in Congress have substantially higher household wealth than men serving in the same party, and this has been true since at least the 1980s. We articulate three mechanisms that could explain this gender wealth gap, and we use new data on members of Congress and their families to assess the relevance of each mechanism. We find no evidence that the wealth gap arises because districts that are more likely to elect women also generally tend to elect wealthier members. We find some evidence that the gap can be explained by women facing steeper challenges that wealth helps them overcome, and we find strong evidence that it is explained by women MCs' spouses earning more money than men MCs' spouses. Our analysis sheds light on how obstacles facing ambitious women can lead to apparently counterintuitive advantages among the women who manage to succeed.

How distinctive career paths affect party rebellion.	Spatial analyses of parties’ position demonstrate that parties are not unified entities. Previous studies have systematically analysed determinants of MPs’ dissent behaviour without giving attention to candidates’ characteristics who represent a broader sample of politicians with distinctive career paths. Bringing in different range of theories from careerism, representation, and party congruence literature, I argue that politicians who have not had any ‘real’ job outside of politics before becoming a candidate and an MP follow the party line more than other candidates, whereas the rise of this type of politicians lead parties to become more centrist. Using cross-national evidence from the Comparative Candidate Study and Chapel Hill Expert Survey, I find evidence that careerists and party soldiers may adopt moderate views close to their party, whereas outsiders are more likely to deviate from the party line. The positional shifts of candidates are dependent of the probability of electoral success and age. This paper breaks a new ground making a new theoretical and empirical contribution on the field of professionalization, intra-party politics, and theories of spatial analysis.

A Qualitative Comparative Analysis	Research on the underrepresentation of youth in parliaments has so far focused on the intersection of age and gender, institutional effects of electoral systems, age requirements or quotas and voter preferences - but only rarely on societal context factors or political parties. This is quite astonishing as parties are central in the selection of candidates. We built a dataset of party parliamentary groups in advanced democracies between 2017 and 2020 and will conduct a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Building upon previous literature, we take societal context factors into account as well as party characteristics and expect the share of young MPs to be higher under the following conditions: a proportional representation electoral system, low age requirements for candidacy, a low/high median age of the population, relatively low GDP per capita, strong party youth organizations and an inclusive party ideology. By following and applying the newest guidelines on good practices in QCA research, including different robustness checks we will present one of the first applications of these in the contexts of party and representation research.

The political and economic elite that coalesced around slave-derived wealth prior to the mid-19th Century was so firmly established that ties to slavery within Britain’s political institutions have persisted well into the post-abolition era. This project seeks to quantify and chart these ties over time, using a novel computational technique harnessing Wikipedia connections as a means of operationalising historical proximity between individuals. This technique enables the generation of a variable describing personal proximity to slavery, including via familial, social, and financial connections. Aggregating this data for MPs across a series of historical parliaments demonstrates how links to slavery persisted via dynastic and other social ties into the 20th Century, and the extent to which connections to slavery still exist among contemporary MPs. The results emphasise the extent to which slavery and its legacies continue to play an active role in Britain, as well as offering an efficient and reliable new method for measuring social proximity using online data.

In the conjoint experiment, we present respondents with a range of fictitious persons that differ along key socio-structural characteristics and ask them how much they identify with each of these persons. To analyze our conjoint experiment, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical linear model that makes use of auxiliary information to account for respondent heterogeneity and increase the precision of individual-level estimates. We demonstrate the utility of our approach for generating a variety of important quantities, such as subjective measures of individuals and group’s social identification with any desired social group, summary measures of the overall importance of chosen dimensions for social identification, or estimates of consensus or contestation concerning the salience of specific characteristics for social identification.

Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing allow us to extract information like topics from a text systematically and automatically. The proposed strategy allows us to deepen our understanding of how respondents assess decision-making experiments and why they focus more on certain aspects than others – both on the level of subgroups and to identify individual patterns. Going beyond the analysis and results of stand-alone conjoint experiments, the combination with NLP allows us to better understand the motivation and reasoning behind specific decision-making processes, which can gather important insights into democratic behavior.

If elected, a candidate's impact on policy outcomes depends on the broader political environment, as democratic policymaking involves multiple elected officials. We build a game-theoretic model to study how nomination incentives for policy-motivated (district) parties in a single member district election are shaped by the (national) political environment. Combining a standard model of electoral competition with a model of legislative bargaining, we show a party's relative national-level policymaking power is negatively correlated with the probability of winning the district election (holding fixed the voter distribution). The prediction is in line with empirically observed patterns of partisan balancing and midterm loss in US politics. Additional results focus on how nomination incentives change when elite party polarization increases, and when voter's perceptions of local candidates are contaminated by the national party.

This study aims to address these critiques by leveraging data uniquely available from candidate-choice conjoint survey experiments. An advantage of candidate-choice conjoint experiments is that, by design, political candidates may adopt the full range of policy positions in hypothetical elections, including policy match-ups rarely observed in real-world elections. Leveraging this data, we define and estimate the 'empirical best response function' of political candidates in response to how survey-respondents vote over the full range of possible policy positions that candidates may take. We uncover conditional support for the convergence prediction of the median voter theorem. Moreover, we examine the degree of `rationality' of survey-respondents and find voters often, although not always, possess single-peaked preferences and, further, vote according to those preferences. Additionally, we provide empirical tests of several common attributes of formal models of political competition, including: valence advantage, multidimensional policies, and election turn-out. Our study serves to highlight the benefits and possibilities of candidate-choice experiments for formal theory.

This study aims to address these critiques by leveraging data uniquely available from candidate-choice conjoint survey experiments. An advantage of candidate-choice conjoint experiments is that, by design, political candidates may adopt the full range of policy positions in hypothetical elections, including policy match-ups rarely observed in real-world elections. Leveraging this data, we define and estimate the 'empirical best response function' of political candidates in response to how survey-respondents vote over the full range of possible policy positions that candidates may take.

Intra-party Bargaining and the Micro-foundations of Populism	We develop a model of electoral competition in the context of multi-party systems, where policy platforms consist of traditional spatial positions and a policy in favor or against membership in an international union that imposes binding policy constraint on the traditional left-right dimension. We assume that parties consist of two factions, the Opportunists (office-seekers) and the Militants (ideologues), and we extend Roemer's (1998) Party Unanimity Nash Equilibrium (PUNE) concept for endogenously formed parties to derive a manifold of equilibria, ranging form moderate pro-membership, to populist, to polarized anti-membership ones. We then apply the Nash bargaining solution---by allowing for the possibility of party splits as disagreement outcomes---in order to refine our equilibrium predictions and infer under what conditions party splits are the more likely outcomes depending on the perceived benefits of union membership and the scope of policy constrains. We show how populism can arise as the outcome of intra-party bargaining that keeps the party together in the face of strong factionalism over supranational integration. A direct implication of our results is that populism can be innately cyclical.

However, an empirical literature finds that local campaigns and the decisions of local voters are often dominated by national issues. This paper proposes a model that explains the incidence of hijacking of local elections, and how it differs between localities and elections. It focuses on the choices of parties to either run campaigns and inform voters on local issues, or to ride on the coattails of the national environment. Building on the empirical observation that the distribution of partisanship differs between regions (e.g. some will have more left wing voters, others more right wing), it argues that a uniform shift in national opinion will affect incentives in different regions differently. In some regions, a national shift will push more voters into reach, making campaigning more beneficial. In others, the reverse. The paper then investigates differences between parties and the effects of polarization.

However, they developed increasingly distinct ideal-typical polity ideas for the integration of the core state powers that produced the polycrisis. The regulatory polity encourages national self-reliance and regards EU institutions as rule-enforcers. Its adherents preferred to solve the Eurozone crisis through the stricter enforcement of deficit rules or the Migration crisis through stricter border management regulation. The redistributive polity builds on transnational solidarity and the creation of EU-level capacities for burden-sharing. Its proponents preferred Eurobonds and an EU-level border force. We study how mainstream parties’ ideology shapes their preference for a regulatory or redistributive core state power integration mode. We study this on voting advice application data for mainstream parties in all EU member states for the three EU elections between 2009 and 2019. We show that mainstream parties across the socio-economic left-right and the socio-cultural liberal and conservative dimension increasingly promote different kinds of integration. We argue that this growing rift provides voters with an increasingly meaningful choice between different normative conceptions of the EU.

This paper aims to revive the debate on a ‘European housing policy’ by systematically process-tracing the role of the housing industry lobby in shaping EU financial regulation’s impact on housing policy. We argue that the influence of real estate industry organizations and large companies represents a key factor to explain the emergence of an EU favourable regulatory regime for housing financialization. The post-GFC context and the EU macro-economic governance created a favourable environment to frame real estate as a long-term and safe asset, crucial to lighten regulatory pressures.

Previous literature has stressed the importance of investigating both informal practices that shape the democratic debate in the EU institutions and the expedient use of procedural rules to displace deliberation, compromise, and consensus. Barcelona Targets, originally set by the Council in 2002, aimed at increasing female labour-market participation by enhancing the provision of early childhood education and care (ECEC). Their long overdue revision was finally tabled alongside the European Commission's European Care Strategy on 7 September 2022. Using secondary document analysis, process tracing, and expert interviews, this paper investigates the behaviour of populist actors in the Council and, consequently, its impact on the negotiations on childcare policies in the EU. This important case of gender mainstreaming policymaking allows us to assess the impact of populist governments on a medium-to-low salient issue and compare it with previous studies on refugee distribution and economic sanctions.

The literature suggests that a major role for EU efforts to leverage its trade power for non-trade objectives falls to the bodies created by its PTAs to facilitate and institutionalize exchange and dialogue between the parties on matters covered by the agreements. Yet, so far, we know little about the mechanisms through which such bodies foster non-trade issues, including climate topics. How substantive are climate-related discussions? And what explains both the issue's insertion into the discussions and the way it is discussed between different trade partners? The paper presents newly compiled data to assess how climate-related issues feature at PTA meetings, primarily through analysis of meeting documents. It then theorizes and empirically tests what drives variation in climate-related discussions, linking meeting activities to PTA provisions as well as to strategic political priorities of the Commission.

From the campaign to the plenary.	Environmental concern increased among EU citizens before the 2019 European elections. Some candidates in these elections discussed environmental issues during the campaign, possibly responding to this increased concern. Moreover, the environment was a motivator to participate for some citizens, who possibly selected parties/candidates based on environmental issues, providing MEPs with a mandate to act on this EU policy. Nonetheless, the representation of citizens’ environmental concerns would be weak if representation is confined to the campaign period. This paper investigates whether MEPs are fulfilling their campaign commitments by assessing whether environmental salience during the campaign is related with casting pro-environmental votes. The latter is measured using the emissions’ reduction target that MEPs supported in the context of the European Climate Law. Environmental salience is computed through a content analysis of tweets (using a dictionary approach) that MEPs had posted during the campaign. Finding a relationship between MEPs environmental salience during the campaign and their vote in the plenary would suggest that citizens’ environmental concerns are represented at the EU level and that MEPs perform their task of representing EU citizens.

While a pertinent task in combating climate change (CC), its effectiveness relies on countries ability to match their international commitments at the national level. A growing body of work on the vertical harmonization of CC mitigation commitments has quantified the gap between NDCs and national policies using the Vertical Policy Harmonization (VPH) Index and qualified the gap by studying the role of macro-level factors in driving vertical (dis)harmony. The European Union (EU) presents a puzzling case given the international commitments of EU member states are expressed as a collective effort under the EU’s NDC and the only national mitigation commitments of some members originate at the supranational level. The study presented here addresses these confounding aspects by comparing different aggregation of the VPH Index and assess the extent to which institutional settings and interests can explain the observed variation of commitment harmonization in the EU.

Research has so far focused mainly on EU conditionality to explain the accession process. However, the process remains challenging, putting the continuous explanatory power of conditionality into question. Compared to the Council and the Commission, little attention has been paid to the influence of the European Parliament on the integration process of the Western Balkan candidate countries. This study focuses on the cases of Albania and North Macedonia, which recently started accession negotiations, to trace the European Parliament's influence on the decision-making process and outcome. I argue that the European Parliament can influence the decision-making process regarding accession negotiations in the context of parliamentary empowerment and as a result of relations with political parties in these two countries. The study draws on data on the membership of Albanian and North Macedonian political parties in the political groups of the European Parliament as a starting point for the analysis, a discourse analysis of the joint parliamentary committees in the EU, and interviews with members of parliament.

Austrian and Dutch Leadership in Forging European Counter-Coalitions	Multiple crises in the European Union (EU) have caused steps towards deeper integration after difficult negotiations. A new development in staging opposition to such crisis-induced integration is the formation of publicly salient counter-coalitions formed by small states, such as the ‘New Hanseatic League’ in eurozone reform and the ‘Frugal Four’ in fighting the COVID-19 crisis. Why and how do small EU member states forge organized and public opposition? We argue that national governments can become entrapped by catering to Eurosceptic sentiments at the domestic level (post-functionalism) and simultaneously responding to functional necessities at the European level (neo-functionalism). Counter-coalitions strengthen their position, but make it harder to find solutions and sell them to their national audience. To assess our argument, we compare the roles of Austria and the Netherlands in forging the ‘Frugal Four’ and the ‘New Hansa’. Moreover, we add a case where small-state counter-coalitions have not (yet) emerged, namely the reform of European fiscal rules. By providing a two-level game explanation for the emergence of European counter-coalitions, we contribute to the research agenda of crisis-induced integration in the EU.

We test whether attendance is explained by legislative responsibilities such as voting in plenary or Committee and if so, we expect variation according to vote margins, votes’ importance, preference alignment with the party group leadership, as well as across party groups and policy areas. We then assess whether re-election and important positions within the EP are associated with attendance compared to mean attendance of the respective party group. We assembled a large dataset with information on daily attendance 2004-2022, including whether voting took place that day, votes’ outcomes as well as individual vote choices, representatives’ nationalities, national party affiliations, European Group affiliations, responsibilities in Parliament of each representative at any given day during the period of study, as well as a battery of controls such as policy areas, the weather that day in Brussels and the gender of the representatives.

The proposed paper seeks to fill this research gap by focusing on a particular subset of candidates: those who enter the EP as nation-wide lead candidates or top candidates for their constituency. Drawing on an original dataset that covers 180 candidates from 114 parties and 15 Member States, we address the following research questions: What experience have candidates acquired prior to running for a mandate as lead candidate? And what explains variation in the career profiles of lead candidates? We differentiate between experience in the executive, the legislature and within parties at both the subnational, national and European level. Our empirical analysis centers on two sets of explanatory variables: party goals (vote seeking, office seeking, policy seeking) and candidate selection procedures.

When cross-pressured, how do political parties choose between two dimensions of political competition? Do we see clear prioritisation of one dimension over another consistently for all parties, and does politicisation matter consistently for all dimensions? To test our novel hypothesis on issue dimension competition, we leverage EP roll call voting data of over 400 national parties, ParlGov, CHES and Eurobarometer data, combined with our dataset scaling the entire EU immigration acquis (1995-2018) on the pro/anti-immigration and the pro/anti-EU dimensions. We find that the EU dimension is clearly negotiable, as it appears to 'follow' the immigration dimension. We furthermore find that the EU issue dimension is more sensitive to politicisation and particularly in the case of niche parties. While substantive issue dimensions appear immune to public opinion shifts, the European issue dimension has the potential to shake up political competition.

In this paper, we challenge these conclusions. Based on two survey experiments conducted in Germany and Italy in 2020 and 2022, we show that German public opinion depends on the strategic assessment of the costs (high or low) of a euro breakup. Surprisingly, the German public does not oppose risk-sharing through transfers or central bank bond purchases, while it remains slightly unfavorable to eurobonds. In turn, Italians are strongly opposed to austerity, especially as tax increases but also as expenditure cuts and structural reforms. Their hostility remains even when the potentially high costs of Italexit are highlighted. Our results are consistent across the 2020 and the 2022 experiments, suggesting a path toward further fiscal integration is possible.

However, its multi-level governance structure makes it hard to discern who is responsible for policy outcomes. This can create incentives for politicians, including Members of Parliament (MPs), to blur the lines of responsibility through communication strategies. Which factors determine how MPs in Member States (MS) of the EU assign responsibility for economic crisis management to the EU? The paper addresses this question through the theoretical lens of blame and credit strategies, distinguishing between institutional and preference-based factors. Using parliamentary speeches, the paper combines dictionary methods and sentiment analysis to examine how MPs in 4 EU MS strategically communicated about the EU in recent economic crises. The findings can inform debates about the direction of democratic accountability in the EU in policy-making and academic circles.

Cleavage Structures of European Cultural Project Funding	To what extent do structural imbalances between Western and Eastern European countries occur in EU’s cultural project funding programs? The Commission is repeatedly confronted with the allegation that participation in the EU’s funding programs overproportionately benefits actors from already established member states whereas applicants from new Eastern European member states have relatively harder times in adjusting to the specific requirements. However, these structural imbalances are not based on solid empirical evidence. For this reason, data on all cultural projects since the early 2000s is compiled and systematically analysed with statistical methods. For historical reasons, an imbalance is most likely to be found between Western and Eastern Europe. It is therefore questionable whether the two most important factors – administrative capacities and the availability of co-financing – can be held accountable for potential imbalances. If Western European countries outperform Eastern European countries both in obtaining funds and in these technical components, this could grow the suspicion that project funding is based on Western logics as Eastern European countries are systematically disadvantaged in core factors affecting the performance in obtaining funds.

The low level of internal cohesion of Eurosceptic groups and the “cordon sanitaire” applied by the other groups have also contributed to their low level of legislative influence. Yet we know little about the Eurosceptics’ level of influence in the EP. This paper will discuss and measure the extent to which Eurosceptic party groups can have an influence when voting in plenary. Specifically, this contribution will determine the conditions for Eurosceptics to be influential on a given vote (cohesion, grand coalition, polarisation) and will investigate for which type of vote these conditions are met.

Machine learning for validating survey data	Many National Statistical Institutes (NSI) employ surveys to gather data, and since survey data is prone to measurement error, these organizations also work to assure the quality of the data. Processes of quality assurance involve a validation process that is usually manual, which renders the process time consuming, unclear and dependent on individuals. At the same time, learning from previous data and other data sources to predict the likelihood of a correct survey answer is a task that is well suited for machine learning. In this paper, I use the survey from Statistics Norway on enterprises' research and development (R&D) efforts to show how machine learning algorithms can improve efficiency, transparency and transferability in the validation process, thus also improving the overall quality of the data.

However, large numbers of interviews mean hand-coding open answer responses is often cost prohibitive. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically topic modeling, can drastically reduce the cost of coding open answer responses, while increasing the degree of nuance researchers can track. The successful application of topic model algorithms allows researchers to uncover salient categorical data, as well as track how those categories change over time. In this paper, I present the current topic modeling methods, address their appropriateness for short survey responses, and introduce topic models using word embeddings and cluster analysis. Word embeddings reduce data loss seen in latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and structural topic models (STM), and offer a more intuitive theoretical foundation.

However, estimates may be biased when certain minority individuals can and feel a need to conceal their identity from researchers due to stigma. The following study makes use of four waves of Special Eurobarometer surveys on discrimination in the EU conducted between 2009 and 2019. More precisely, I estimate three cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) to examine whether greater tolerance in a country increases outgroup identification in the surveys or whether outgroup identification leads to greater tolerance when minority identities can be concealed. I expect that greater tolerance in a country will have the strongest effect on LGBT identification given that this group has the greatest leeway in concealing its minority identity. I also estimate two placebo models for disabled people and ethnic minorities, whose minority identity is more visible and therefore more difficult to hide in front of pollsters. As hypothesized, I find evidence in favor of a greater tolerance increasing minority identification for LGBT people in the surveys, but no effects for disabled people and ethnic minorities.

This participation difference can be explained by several factors, most notably individual characteristics of target persons (such as gender, formal education) as well as context-level factors (such as local unemployment rates). However, we often lack information on individual characteristics for non-respondents, but are able, in the case of multi-stage surveys to use information from earlier participation for later stage non-respondents. This study combines contextual information from the borough level, sampling frame information (e.g. age, gender) and survey data from the IMGES II, conducted as a longitudinal campaign survey during the 2021 German federal election in Duisburg, a Western German metropolis. The two-stage design based on a population registry sample makes it possible to analyse participation in a postal screening wave and a subsequent three-wave CATI survey among natives and three immigrant-origin groups. Preliminary results show that the same sets of target person’s individual characteristics and borough-level variables including COVID-19 incidence rates contain different explanations for unit-nonresponse in all survey stages for the sampled origin groups.

In most cases, radical right parties have become entrenched features of party systems, yet still subject to stigmatization and exclusion from government. However, apart from this exclusion, it is unclear how mainstream party behavior reflects, and in turn sustains, radical right party stigma. We offer a novel perspective on this question, using audio data as a window into micro-level party competition. Specifically, we argue that politicians sustain radical right party stigma in part by using more rousing and indignant speech when addressing radical right partes. To test our theory, we compile a large collection of audio recordings spanning thousands of speeches in the Danish parliament, and develop and validate a speech-level measure of indignation. Consistent with the theory, we find that mainstream politicians disproportionately express indignation toward radical right parties, and that indignation increases with political distance. We are the first to use audio data in the study of party competition. Our findings shed new light on how elite behavior sustains party reputations and mass affective polarization.

Addressing the partial contestation problem in multiparty electoral contests	Although most scholars acknowledge that district-level election results are compositional variables, few model them as such. Instead, they tend to model the shares of single parties across districts. This is mostly the case because of partial contestation – situations in which not all parties field candidates in every electoral district. We evaluate potential solutions to address the problem of partial contestation using compositional models. The dominant approach is to estimate seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models using only fully contested districts. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this approach and other strategies that are often used are biased when partial contestation follows a selection process. Based on Heckman (1979), we propose an unbiased two-stage modeling strategy in which a party’s decision of whether or not to contest a particular district is the first stage, and a compositional model of the resulting competition is the second one. We test this compositional-selection model against other strategies using simulated and real-world data and find encouraging results.

It sparked the (massive) literature on central bank (in)dependence, democractisation, and development. Yet, this literature largely overlooks the simultaneous revolution in the monetary system: the birth of the unalterable, fixed metallic standard. Dating back to the Norman Conquest, England's exchange rate regime had been fixed but (highly!) adjustable. By shifting to the permanently fixed regime in the 1690s, the English sovereign relinquished its rights to reduce its (real) public debt burden through currency depreciation. Moreover, archival manuscripts reveal the cleavage between the Bank of England's champions and those who imposed the shift toward the fixed regime. Indeed, the latter argued that it was all the more necessary *because* the newly created banks (including the Bank of England) would inflate credit and further depreciate the pound. Seen in this light, the early Bank of England appears as an engine of (relatively) soft money, a mechanism to steer credit toward the Treasury, and as a highly *dependent* """"""""central bank.""""""""

Blaming and Defending the International Monetary Fund 	When do governments blame International Organizations (IOs)? The blame avoidance literature suggests that IOs are easy targets for shifting blame for contested policies because they lack access to domestic media and have complex decision-making structure. However, the degree to which a government blames an IO varies both across countries and within-countries over time. We argue that governments’ decision to scapegoat IOs reflects a trade-off between blame avoidance and policy gains. Specifically, blaming IOs detours domestic discontent toward the respective IO, but also provokes resistance against IO policies. In contrast, defending IOs attracts public dissatisfaction toward the government, but helps to reach domestic acceptance of IO policies. We further theorize factors that make blame avoidance or policy gains more important for governments. To test our theoretical argument, we focus on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an oft-cited IO to be a scapegoat and draw on an original global dataset of over 600 statements on the IMF by national leaders. The paper has important implications for the growing public contestation over IOs and international cooperation.

Yet, political scientists lack a theoretical framework for the study of monetary institutions like central bank independence (CBI) and fixed exchange rates (FIX) in the current macroeconomic context. Previous research was built on the assumption that these monetary institutions should be studied together as a response to the same economic problem (inflation control). The focus was on understanding under what conditions FIX and CBI function as institutional substitutes or complements. In this paper, we seek to reconnect the scholarship on CBI and FIX within a new (third-generation”) framework that considers multiple macroeconomic objectives (with a focus on inflation control and exchange rate stability), while recognizing how these policy goals and monetary institutions are often in tension with each other. We evaluate untested hypotheses within the “second-generation” framework regarding whether CBI and FIX function as substitutes or as complements in terms of inflation control, finding little support for either proposition. Results provide evidence consistent with our framework’s macrofoundations.

Yet, political scientists lack a theoretical framework for the study of monetary institutions like central bank independence (CBI) and fixed exchange rates (FIX) in the current macroeconomic context. Previous research was built on the assumption that these monetary institutions should be studied together as a response to the same economic problem (inflation control). The focus was on understanding under what conditions FIX and CBI function as institutional substitutes or complements. In this paper, we seek to reconnect the scholarship on CBI and FIX within a new (third-generation”) framework that considers multiple macroeconomic objectives (with a focus on inflation control and exchange rate stability), while recognizing how these policy goals and monetary institutions are often in tension with each other.

We know that states seek to get their nationals hired into senior positions at IOs, but the reasons behind this are less well-understood. In addition, we know much less about attempts by member states to place their nationals in staff-level positions in IOs. I show that the policy preferences of IOs are more similar to those countries that have many of their nationals employed at the IO. In addition, I find that not all countries have an equal ability to get their nationals hired by IOs. Examining an original dataset on UN staff nationalities, I show that major donors to voluntarily-funded UN development agencies have a larger number of their nationals on staff than do similar non-major donors. I further demonstrate that those agencies' aid portfolios look more similar to countries that have a large number of their nationals on the agency's staff. This suggests that staffing can be a important mechanism through which member states influence IOs.

This paper investigates the consequences of the Global Gag Rule (GGR) – one of the most prominent examples of aid politicization – which was first enacted in 1984 and prohibited abortion-related activities by NGOs receiving USAID funding. The policy has been subsequently revoked by every Democratic President and reinstated by every Republican. Analyzing cross-national time-series data from 1990 to 2019 for 149 countries, I find that maternal mortality in aid-recipient countries is higher when the GGR is in effect and when Republicans control both houses of Congress, while the presence of skilled birth attendants is lower. HIV deaths in recipient countries also increase when the GGR is in place, reflecting the policy's broader chilling effects. The paper also presents evidence for intermediate outcomes and mechanisms — suggesting US funding for HIV and reproductive and maternal health has been affected by political business cycles, with consequences for project effectiveness. A case study of Uganda, one of the world's primary health aid recipients, illustrates the downstream burden of politicized aid.

We theorize how political considerations, related to regime survival and policy cues in recipient states, shape the inclusion of gender equality as a policy goal in Western aid projects. Drawing information from the OECD’s Gender Equality Policy Marker (GEPM), we divide projects according to whether policy goals are more or less threatening to regime survival. Our analysis reveals differences in how Western donors engage with democracies and autocracies on women's rights. In autocracies, donors adopt a more cautious approach: tailoring their gender-related goals toward social sector projects rather than politically-sensitive projects related to democracy and governance. Donors also respond more to policy cues in autocracies, avoiding targeting gender in regimes with low female representation and low de jure rights. By uncovering the recipient-level conditions under which donors prioritize gender equality, our inquiry sheds new light onto debates about the domestic effects of aid, as well as how Western donors interact with autocrats.

Voters who live in an area that received aid were more likely to anticipate voting for incumbent councillors. Further, we show that aid increased the number of visits by incumbents and we provide anecdotal evidence of more credit claiming activity by politicians.

We seem to be living in an age of insecurity. However, some are likely to be more vulnerable to shocks than others, indicating that we may not expect insecurity to be equally distributed across the population. In this paper, we first examine how subjective insecurity is distributed. We find that poor people are in fact more insecure. We then turn to the question of whether welfare states with their promise of ‘equal security for all’ can reduce this gap, a question which has been largely absent from comparative welfare state research. Using multilevel models with cross-national data for about 19,000 individuals in 20 advanced democracies from the OECD’s Risks That Matter (RTM) survey, we find that the welfare state does in fact have the capacity to reduce insecurity among the population. However, welfare state interventions do not meaningfully reduce inequalities in insecurity among income groups. We complement this with national survey data from Denmark (2004-2021). We not only see that insecurity has increased, but also that there is a growing security gap, echoing the cross-national findings.

The case of WTO trade disputes by the US	Scholars have been widely studying political and economic determinants of WTO dispute settlement participation. Yet, the underlying mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this article, I focus on one causal mechanism to explain why larger (bilateral) sectoral trade leads to a higher likelihood of trade disputes. I argue that governments have strategic incentives to protect domestic industries that employ a larger share of workers against breaches of international trade agreements because these could create negative repercussion on the market competition level and thus lead to firm closure and unemployment. I test these assumptions with a logistic regression on a new dataset that combines sectoral trade data with sectoral employment data for 12 sectors in the US from 1995 to 2020. The findings show that higher sectoral trade and larger employment shares increase the probability of initiating a WTO trade dispute. Moreover, I extend the analysis to other forms of trade disputes to corroborate my findings. This study suggests that employment shares influence political decisions and that governments initiate more trade disputes when foreign trade policies harm large sectors.

Besides redistribution across income classes, one of the core features of the welfare state is to mitigate the risk of unemployment through social insurance. Traditional models propose that exposure to risks at the occupational and industry level are significant predictors of individual-level preferences for social insurance. In this paper, I examine whether workplace risk exposure – a related but stronger signal about the risk of future unemployment – shapes attitudes toward social insurance. Linking novel population-wide administrative records tapping the official proportion of workplace colleagues becoming unemployed from one year to the next with a three-wave panel survey, I confront common theoretical and methodological challenges in existing work. My findings show that citizens rely on cues about the risk of future unemployment from their workplace when forming attitudes toward social insurance. Furthermore, I show that the effect is strongest when colleagues with shared are fired, which suggests that self-interested concerns drive the results.

In recent years, young democracies have vastly expanded anti-poverty social assistance programs. While such programs were initially met with broad support across deeply unequal societies, the slowing of macroeconomic growth in recent years has laid bare the costs and tradeoffs imposed by social protection on government budgets, raising questions about the political sustainability. We hypothesize that individuals who are more physically and economically secure will be more supportive of redistribution while individuals who are less secure should be less committed to redistribution to the poor. The mechanism we propose is through the effect of insecurity on authoritarian values such as xenophobia, vigilantism, and support for the death penalty. We test this hypothesis in South Africa through analysis of original household survey data of 1,500 households and representative focus group discussions consisting of over 100 individual citizens. Analysis of the survey data reveals broad public support for social welfare programs across society, but this commitment weakens among individuals who are more insecure. We demonstrate the mediating role of authoritarian values on support for redistribution among more insecure citizens.

In recent years, young democracies have vastly expanded anti-poverty social assistance programs. While such programs were initially met with broad support across deeply unequal societies, the slowing of macroeconomic growth in recent years has laid bare the costs and tradeoffs imposed by social protection on government budgets, raising questions about the political sustainability. We hypothesize that individuals who are more physically and economically secure will be more supportive of redistribution while individuals who are less secure should be less committed to redistribution to the poor. The mechanism we propose is through the effect of insecurity on authoritarian values such as xenophobia, vigilantism, and support for the death penalty. We test this hypothesis in South Africa through analysis of original household survey data of 1,500 households and representative focus group discussions consisting of over 100 individual citizens. Analysis of the survey data reveals broad public support for social welfare programs across society, but this commitment weakens among individuals who are more insecure. We demonstrate the mediating role of authoritarian values on support for redistribution among more insecure citizens.

As these policies have significant distributional effects, they became strongly politicized. Especially as inflation increased, calls to end UMPs became widespread. Despite their distributive consequences and politicization, the political implications of UMPs remain poorly understood. In particular, we know very little about public opinion toward these different UMPs. We use two survey experiments conducted in Germany and the Netherlands to assess people’s preferences. First, a conjoint survey shows that the interest rate is the most salient measure for respondents. A majority of respondents are opposed to negative rates, while they are open to forward guidance and quantitative easing, especially if the latter is tied to debt and environmental stability concerns. Second, a framing experiment shows that opposition to negative rates is driven by both ego-tropic and sociotropic concerns. Respondents are particularly concerned about inflation, but they also strongly respond to arguments about the effect of negative rates on income and wealth inequalities.

The wide-spread arbitrariness in refugee status determination has, however, not yet received proper micro-foundations that trace this “asylum lottery” or “refugee roulette” to the behavior of the two key actors in the decision on an asylum requests – the applicant and the responsible case worker. In this article, I introduce a two-sided incomplete information game in which the asylum-seeker is uncertain about the potential bias of the first instance decision-maker and this “street level” bureaucrat is in return unsure how credible the claims by the applicant are. The model allows to derive how these two crucial parameters influence the risk of wrongful decisions and how unbiased adjudication lowers the potential for positive and negative discrimination. The model implications will be illustrated with case studies from German administrative courts.

In contrast to previous work that has focused on the use of war to stop impending alliances, we study how targeted states may strike quid-pro-quo ``deals'' with potential allies. In these deals, targeted states offer concessions to states planning to ally against them. In exchange, the potential allies forego implementation of a new alliance. Consequently, the threat of a new alliance is eliminated. To illustrate this logic and trace its consequences, we analyze a dynamic formal model of alliance formation, negotiations, and conflict. We illustrate the strategic dynamics embodied in the model by tracing the logic in documentation from the historical record, tying our results to the Cuban missile crisis, the Baghdad pact, and U.S. commitments in east Asia in the 1950s.

Specifically, I focus on the disclosure mandates' implications on the agent's incentives to continue a failing policy (``doubling down'') only to leave a good impression on the principal. The result is that disclosure mandates can discourage the agent from continuing a failing policy when doing so can severely damage her legacy. The second result is that the minimum damage that the disclosure mandates discourage doubling down decreases as a replacement is strong (e.g., a competitive election) or/and the principal's ability to access and use the disclosed information improves. The third result is that the disclosure mandates induce policy conservatism when they discourage doubling down. Lastly, I show that the gain in the principal's ability to select an agent by disclosure mandates also increases as the severity of the damage from a failing policy increases.

In these places, state interventions in the form of enforcement policies against organized criminal groups (OCGs) sometimes improve security and, in others, exacerbate violence. While existing explanations of this variation focus only on conditions under which criminal wars can happen due to commitment problems, I propose a dynamic model to understand the effects of these policies when criminal wars occur due to information asymmetries. I then embed the model into a framework of electoral accountability to understand how electoral incentives shape enforcement policies against OCGs. Contrary to the results from existing theories, the state reduces violence by not targeting the most violent criminal groups.

Interest Groups and Relational Contracts	This paper studies quid-pro-quo dynamic agreements between an interest group and two political parties. Political parties repeatedly compete for office. Before each election, the interest group decides which party to support. When in power, parties choose the rent they transfer to the interest group to buy its support. Yet, binding agreements are not possible, so agreements must be self-enforcing. When political fluctuations are mild, the interest group favors an opportunistic agreement in which it always supports the current incumbent. As political fluctuations increase, the interest group prefers an exclusive agreement in which it supports a single party even when it is in opposition. An interest group with more inefficient rents is also less likely to favor an opportunistic agreement. The model offers a novel explanation for why studies on the impact of campaign contributions on policymaking find mixed evidence. Besides, my results shed new light on existing empirical findings by showing that interest groups' long-term loyalty does not necessarily imply an ideological alignment, and interest groups' opportunism can be a sign of high-quality institutions.

To provide insights into this relationship, we develop a simple model of politics where a politician faces a popular policy and must choose between calling a referendum or attempting to pass the policy via the legislature. In equilibrium, referendums can be used strategically to either increase or decrease the probability of the policy passing and can signal that the politician is more or less aligned with the voter. Under certain conditions, we show that referendums are called more often when voters believe that politicians are more likely to be misaligned. However, whenever this is the case, the referendum induces inefficient policy distortions: all else equal, voters and the politician who called the referendum would benefit from legislating instead.

Agreeing with previous studies on the salience of pocketbook concern while subscribing to the """"""""insurance"""""""" explanation of tax preference, I empirically compare individual economic prospect against one’s current income in terms of their role in pushing public opposition to fossil-fuel taxes. Using the European Social Survey data from 23 countries, I find that the former, which is operationalized as expected income decline or job loss, prevails over the latter in not only substantive effect magnitude but also out-of-sample prediction. My analysis also implies that the underlying mechanism is not sociotropic or other-regarding concern but more likely to be self-interested consideration. Beyond underscoring the temporally misspecified pocketbook concern in the climate policy preference research, this paper also aims at bringing idiosyncratic (in comparison with endogenous/sectoral) economic insecurity into the related literature more.

These policies need to align with international and domestic climate goals. However, currently, policies are usually discussed and studied to maximize public acceptance at a given time - neglecting the alignment with goals. Our unique preregistered experimental method engages in interdisciplinary research, as we, together with energy modeling experts, co-created policy mixes that align with specific policy goals. Using a novel survey, we study the role goal alignment plays in individual opinion formation about ambitious policy mixes among a large sample of n = 5,655 individuals. Our approach enables us to differentiate between potential mechanisms behind the non-acceptance of policy mixes, namely between citizens who do not want policies that can reach the relevant policy goals and those who do not want to meet the goals. We show that communicating policy goals jointly with policy mixes can significantly increase the public support for ambitious policies, with direct implications for policy makers.

While governments have a crucial role in orchestrating the green transition, parties face little incentive to enact climate policies that impose short-term costs on their supporters. This article explores how mainstream parties use climate policies as a signaling device to position themselves on the issue of the green transition, claim credit and appeal to climate-conscious voters. It also examines the effect of this strategy on policy output. To do so, I analyse five climate reforms enacted in France from 2009 to 2022 by conservative, social-democratic, and centre-right governments. This process-tracing analysis triangulates data from news sources, parliamentary debates, and votes. The preliminary findings are that (1) mainstream parties’ dilemma between attracting climate-conscious voters and alienating their existing constituencies is reinforced by the threat of challenger parties (greens or radical right) contesting their policy choices; (2) they walk this fine line by engaging in blame-avoidance strategies like incrementalism and delay. This paper contributes to the literature on the drivers of climate policy and the effect of party competition on policy change.

Policy-makers increasingly call for and adopt policies that take into account the welfare dimension of climate policy. ‘Climate welfare policy’ aims to address social risks stemming from the transition without holding up the transition itself. This paper makes three contributions to the growing literature on the interface of climate and welfare. First, I offer a conceptualization of (distributive) climate welfare policies, based on which sector (carbon-intensive versus carbon-neutral) and which agent (corporates or individuals) the policy addresses. Second, I propose an analytical framework for climate welfare politics, arguing that the integration of climate and welfare policy changes the politics of the welfare state fundamentally: climate welfare politics goes ‘quiet’. Third, I explore my arguments with empirical evidence from a comparative case study of the implementation of the EU Just Transition Mechanism in three of the most carbon-intensive regions in the EU. Overall, the paper contributes to our understanding of the conditions under which governments invest in the long-term.

Evidence from Choice Experiments on Climate Adaptation Investment Preferences in Three High-Income Countries	Global warming results in increased risks to economic assets and people, and the larger these risks become the more societies will be forced to prioritise investment in climate change adaptation measures. On the presumption that median voter preferences matter, we use choice experiments in three large economies (US, Japan, Germany) to study preference formation amongst the mass public in this domain. Our experiment focuses on flood risks and exposes study participants to pairs of communities that differ in various ways, including exposure to flood risks, economic vitality, property values and lives at risk, funding aimed at relocating the population versus building protection infrastructure, and the political orientation of the community government. Respondents are asked to allocate a total of $10m between the two communities and also rate them in terms of their deservingness. We are particularly interested in testing hypotheses on trade-offs between community attributes, for example whether the public is more (or less) supportive of climate adaptation investment into communities characterised by more property than people at risk, or whether political orientation biases investment priorities.

Now, most prominent authoritarian IGOs engage in election monitoring, as do many other less prominent IGOs and INGOs. In this paper, we develop hypotheses to explain variation in which organizations take up the practice of international election monitoring. We consider factors such as organizations' members, missions, resources, and regions. In addition, we consider how high-quality monitors respond to the activities of low-quality monitors at the elections where both types of groups are present. To test our hypotheses, we draw on new data on international election observation since 2000. Our dataset includes information on what we believe is the largest set of international election monitors, which we categorize as either high, middle, or low quality.

While understanding what legitimises IOs in the eyes of political elites has attracted extensive research, recent events challenging IOs has sparked research on ‘backlash’ and delegitimation. International criminal tribunals (ICTs) are among the institutions facing widespread delegitimation. However, we know little about why and how political elites attempt to delegitimise IOs. Addressing this gap, we explore why and through which mechanisms political elites pursue delegitimation. We theorize two possible motivations for elite delegitimation of ICTs, which have distinct observable implications. First, delegitimation may be strategic and pursued to maximise the utility and self-interests of relevant actors, following a logic of consequences. We expect strategic delegitimation to manifest as the mobilization of ethnic nationalism in critiques of ICTs. Second, belief-based delegitimation adheres to a logic of appropriateness and is motivated by normative commitments and will manifest in critiques about procedures and substantive rules. Based on cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, we investigate the causal mechanisms linking elite motivations to acts of delegitimation.

In this article, we argue that a state's integration into the global governance and economic order incorporates extraterritorial subjects into the set of actors that the domestic judiciary can influence beyond its sovereign boundaries. Therefore, the effect of domestic court proceedings can reach foreign jurisdictions, even if foreign countries do not change their own policies. Specifically, we take advantage of the expansion of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) jurisdiction as an exogenous instrument in limiting multinational corporations' (MNCs) corrupt exchanges with state-owned enterprises in authoritarian regimes. Using a new dataset on MNC lawsuit activities in China, we show that the new legal restraints have a long-arm deterrent effect by decreasing the litigation advantages of MNCs that form joint-venture partnerships with state-owned enterprises. Moreover, by employing a difference-in-differences design, we find that the extraterritorial effect leads to worse investment performance for U.S.-listed firms operating in China's state-dominated sectors. This article advances our understanding of foreign direct investment in authoritarian regimes, MNCs' risk-mitigation strategies, and the interactions between domestic and transnational legal institutions.

We introduce a new typology of democracy-related provisions in PTAs and present novel insights from a new database. We then test a number of competing explanations why some PTAs are more ambitious than others and which types of categories of democracy promotion have been advocated, ranging from explicit obligations that advance democratization to more indirect and implicit commitments to strengthen individual rights and norms related to transparency and inclusiveness. We provide evidence that the EU is most ambitious in using PTAs for direct democracy promotion. However, regarding commitments capturing indirect and implicit strategies, other states surface as rule-makers. We also show that PTAs involving new democracies are most likely to embrace both explicit and implicit obligations.

We analyze several observable implications of these mechanisms using a new dataset on votes in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) between 2007-2021. We focus on resolutions with geopolitical implications for Russia. While the ties between Russia and extreme right-wing parties and former communist parties are well documented, we also find considerable support for Russia's positions among politicians from more mainstream parties. Our initial findings suggest that female parliamentarians and parliamentarians from parties with female leadership are significantly less likely to vote for Russia on geopolitical issues.

Based on this argument, we provide a causal analysis of how changes in government composition affects voters’ levels of populist attitudes relying on high quality panel data from Austria and Germany. Our findings provide strong evidence in favor of this argument: partisans strongly react to their preferred party’s change in government status. Moreover, the decrease in populist attitudes appears to be long-lasting, as populist attitudes do not completely rebound to pre-government participation levels when a party goes back into opposition. These results have important implications for the study of populism and representative democracy.

Evidence from the Swiss parliamentary speeches spanning 130 years.  	How can we measure parliamentary populism over time? Members of parliament debate and voice their option, and elements of populism within their speeches might not be uncommon, not even in such a closed setting. Our paper makes two main contributions. 1) we develop a new computational measure for populist expressions, and 2) we study this measure on a newly compiled dataset of parliamentary speeches spanning back to 1891. Our measure of populist expressions is built on previous research that uses dictionaries to identify populist speakers. Rather than focusing on singular words (from word-lists), however, we examine triples, e.g., disentangling subjects, predicates and objects. Furthermore, we rely on semantic role labeling and coreference resolution for correctly allocating meaning to non-descriptive words (such as """"""""we"""""""" or """"""""they"""""""" in previous sentences). In our paper we discuss how parliamentary populism has developed over time and how methods for automatic detection of populist sentiments in texts can be improved.

It Depends Upon if the Populist is the President	Voters are expected to support populists because distrust of state institutions and dissatisfaction with democracy convinces them that populists’ claims about conspiratorial elites are valid. However, most work testing these propositions studies regions and eras when populists are not governing. We propose these dynamics change when populists govern; once they command the institutions, sustained support becomes precisely contingent upon trust in the new institutional order. We use recently collected expert-survey data from Latin America that codes levels of populism at the party level to model vote intentions for populist parties inside and outside of government. Support for populist parties who do not control the presidency is consistent with prior work: individuals who have low levels of trust in state institutions are more likely to support populist challenger parties than non-populist parties, regardless of who is in office. However, support for populist presidents is higher among those who trust state institutions or who believe that the state is performing well. While democratic deficits and poor governance provide openings for populists, they are held accountable for whether they can improve democratic quality.

Positional and non-positional foundations of polarization in parliamentary speech	The expression of conflict and compromise are central to the functioning of representative democratic institutions, especially in parliamentary debate. Several innovations in text-as-data methods enable insights into long-term trends of parliamentary polarization (Jensen et al., 2012; Lauderdale & Herzog, 2016; Peterson & Spirling, 2018). Yet, we know relatively little about the concrete rhetorical patterns in which polarization manifests in political speech. Our study aims at closing this gap by disentangling the positional and non-positional foundations of polarization in parliamentary speech. We conduct a comparative quantitative content analysis of parliamentary speech in historical and political contexts where aggregate-level measurements obtained with text-based machine learning methods indicate different levels of polarization. Our analyses demonstrate that in addition to policy-centered statements about legislators' stances and priorities, polarization often manifests in non-positional rhetoric that involves criticism and appraisal of actors' valence attributes. We conclude that conceptions and measurement strategies that focus exclusively on policy-centered conflict are insufficient to capture the multifaceted nature of parliamentary polarization. Our findings have implications for the quantitative, text-based study of polarization and our understanding of the working of representative democracy.

The difficult question is how to achieve it in practice.While recent elections to the European Parliament (EP) have applied PR in all member states, the specific implementation is hugely variable. This does not only concern the within-party dimension but also the formula for between-party allocation. Notably, many member states continue to use d’Hondt, which is well-known to be less proportional than some other methods and to favour larger parties over smaller ones. This paper examines how counterfactually changing the PR formula would have altered the composition of the EP and its policy decisions. Taking observed voting results as given, I simulate counterfactual EPs, both with regard to composition (party ideology, number of women) and decision-making (roll-call votes). Data come from COMEPELDA and VoteWatch. The analyses, focusing on the fifth to ninth EP, show that changing the formula could lead to EPs that are notably different. The specific direction of the effects varies across elections, depending on the type of small parties doing well.

Yet, how can we explain how these institutions position themselves in the legislative process? In this paper, I explore the factors that influence position formation in the European Parliament (EP). Specifically, the paper examines how the structure of inter-institutional negotiations, intra-institutional conflict and transaction costs, as well as the Commission's predictive ability, shape the EP's incentives to deviate from the Commission proposal. Using an automated technique to create full length legal texts from amendments, I assess the relationship between these characteristics of the legislative process and the distance between the EP report and the original Commission proposal in more than 3,000 co-decision and consultation procedures. The findings have implications for how we view inter-institutional bargaining in the EU and legislative position formation in bicameral legislatures. Furthermore, the technique used to create full length texts from proposal amendments has potential use in text-based EU legislative research employing hypothetical bills to represent individual and institutional level actor positions.

Recent research, however, has shown that under certain circumstances, voters value defection and that legislators strategically employ emotive rhetoric to appeal to voters. This paper builds on these findings, arguing that legislators who vote against the party majority use more emotive language than their loyal colleagues to increase support for their position. Drawing on an original data set consisting of a multilingual corpus of debates and related roll call votes from the 8th and 9th European Parliament (2014-2022), I use a multilingual transformer-based large language model (XLM-RoBERTa) combined with active learning to classify the emotionality of the speeches. Adopting a text matching strategy to obtain credible estimates of the effects of defection on rhetoric, the preliminary findings suggest differences in the degree of emotive language depending on the voting decision. The findings will contribute to our understanding of how legislators communicate intra-party disagreements and why they defect from their party principals, with implications for political representation.

The Impact of Domestic Issue Dispersion on EP Party Unity	Does national-level issue dispersion predict the national party delegations unity in the European Parliament (EP)? Scholars find that disperse issue-level preferences within parties can have a detrimental impact on party’s electability. Fractionalization, within governing parties results in mixed messages to voters over a parties’ issue positions and their viability to hold office or oversee policy-making. These effects can reach beyond the national sphere. We propose that diverse preferences within parties on policy-issues springboard from domestic debates to playout cross-nationally in the EP. As we see more diversity of preferences on salient issues at the national level, we predict these debates will be further amplified within the EP. In effect, voter and elite salience predicts the degree of dispersion within party delegations. To test our argument, we use a multilingual, semi-supervised machine learning approach to scale party issue preferences using the ParlEE Plenary Speeches dataset. The results of this analysis hold implications for theories of parliamentary agenda formation in multilevel settings. Our findings provide theories of national-level debate and disagreement with a key mechanism for influencing the EP policy-making process.

One major difficulty is that rollcall votes may be requested for strategic reasons and that this might affect voting behaviour and, therefore, the validity of scaled preference estimates and party cohesion scores. From April 2020 to March 2022 – during the ninth European Parliament – all voting was recorded to allow Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to verify their vote choices during the Covid pandemic. During this time, more votes were taken by rollcall than during the previous legislative term – 13,520 compared to 10,505. We compare scaled preference estimates and cohesion scores from the period when all votes were recorded to the same estimates using data from the remainder of the ninth European Parliament and estimates from the previous legislative term. This setup allows us to empirically test how severely scaled preference estimates and cohesion scores are affected by a selection bias in rollcall voting in the European Parliament. We contribute to a large literature on the representativeness of rollcall votes.

This paper examines whether or to what extent domestic politics in the EU member states affects the negotiating positions of the Council of Ministers. We posit that the Council adapts its negotiating stance to changes in the public mood across the member states. As the citizens become more skeptical of EU action in a policy domain, the Council's position becomes less prone to increase EU authority. In this way, the Council helps member state governments avoid the costs of domestic public scrutiny. We expect that this effect is amplified when the public has a united voice and treats the EU action in a policy area as a salient matter. Similarly, the Council position is more responsive to the member states led by Europhile governments as they tend to form the winning coalitions during policy-making. Using semi-supervised machine learning, we construct a novel dataset estimating EU authority expansion encapsulated in the Council negotiation positions at the first trilogue.

We posit that the Council adapts its negotiating stance to changes in the public mood across the member states. As the citizens become more skeptical of EU action in a policy domain, the Council's position becomes less prone to increase EU authority. In this way, the Council helps member state governments avoid the costs of domestic public scrutiny. We expect that this effect is amplified when the public has a united voice and treats the EU action in a policy area as a salient matter. Similarly, the Council position is more responsive to the member states led by Europhile governments as they tend to form the winning coalitions during policy-making. Using semi-supervised machine learning, we construct a novel dataset estimating EU authority expansion encapsulated in the Council negotiation positions at the first trilogue. We rely on the Eurobarometer and MARPOR indicators to measure public opinion and governments’ positions on EU action across policy areas, respectively.

Are sanctioned states who face election in the near future more or less likely to acquaise to the demands of the sanctioning states? While the effects of elections have been extensively examined in the context of military conflicts, its possible effect on sanction effectiveness has not been subject to systematic scrutiny. We hypothesize that target governments are more likely to comply with sender demands as the elections loom near. We argue that they do so to avoid the likely political costs of economic hardships triggered by sanctions. We assess the empirical merits of this claim using data on over 1,000 sanction cases between 1950-2020. Results support our hypothesis. We also find that the effect of election proximity is more prominent in less democratic states that hold competitive elections. This suggests that even if sanctions have a relatively low success rate against nondemocratic polities as suggested in the literature, elections may provide a window of opportunity for the senders to extract concessions from the target

However, these studies do not address how the government makes issue linkage credible to activists, who understand that the government has weak incentives to enforce such linkages once the agreement is ratified. How do liberalizing governments make issue linkage credible to activists despite the commitment problem? Focusing on U.S. government decisions regarding environmental clauses in trade agreements, I argue that a liberalizing government uses international treaties to mitigate activists' fears of defection. By recognizing environmental international organizations' authority in trade agreements, the government can mitigate activists' fear of defection and increase their support for trade agreements. Using original data, I find that the government recognized environmental treaties with more ties to U.S.-based activists in designing environmental clauses in trade agreements. Based on a comparative case study and text analysis of novel meeting records, I also show that activists with ties to seven recognized treaties supported issue linkage whereas those without ties to the treaties joined forces with anti-trade groups.

Our results indicate that indeed countries led by left-wing executives/leaders are faster at ratifying treaties than those led by right-wing executives/leaders. The impact of ideology is more evident for democracies than autocracies and during the Cold War than in its aftermath. We also find that external pressure from other states reduces the gap between left and right. Through such findings, the article provides a valuable contribution to the debate over the impact of ideology on international relations and drivers of global support for multilateralism.

However, even largely hierarchical domains have often witnessed enduring contestation of their focal organizations. The paper focuses on the postwar trade domain, initially centered around the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). By drawing on new theoretical insights, it displays how institutional complexity has been a defining feature of this domain, with GATT’s leadership being progressively challenged by new actors. The paper offers two contributions. First, it shows how the GATT countered external institutional threats by modulating its responses on the characteristics of the challenge faced. Second, it unearths the many actors participating in the governance of trade in the postwar years, including the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). By showing how these actors compensated for distinct GATT’s weaknesses, the paper highlights their role in furthering a legitimation of the postwar trade domain and filling existing gaps.

Super- vs. self-imposed sanctions in international organizations	Sanctions by organizations of states have been shown to be more effective than unilateral sanctions. But we do not know what determines the comparative effectiveness of organizational sanctions. For the European Union, disagreements on the optimal scope of sanctions on Russia in 2022 have sparked a debate on the pros and cons of unanimity voting. I argue that the fundamental determinant of the effectiveness of organizational sanctions are its decision-making rules, specifically the degree to which all states can influence the decision to impose sanctions. If the sanctions are super-imposed on a state, it is less likely to enforce the organisational sanction and therefore the success probability of the sanction decreases. The comparative analysis, based on 311 cases imposed by international organizations in the period from 1950 to 2019, confirms this hypothesis. I combine self-coded data on the decision-making rules of sanction-imposing organizations with data on the enforcement and effectiveness of sanctions. My findings imply that, while the EU might be able to impose more sanctions with a different decision-making mechanism, its sanctions would become less effective.

Administrative burdens may include learning costs, process costs, and psychological costs that all come with learning about, applying for, and receiving public services (Herd & Moynihan, 2019). More specifically, racialized burdens are practices in public administration that reinforce patterns of unequal access to services (Ray et al., 2022). The purpose of this paper is to analyze administrative burdens faced by refugees when accessing the German welfare state and to assess the role of policy in creating or minimizing burdens. Through semi-structured interviews with refugees, I compare the administrative challenges faced by respondents from different nationalities. Preliminary findings indicate systematic disparities in administrative burdens by nationality. Variation in asylum case processes can delay or limit access to social benefits for individuals from less-common refugee-sending countries. Supports to assist refugees in navigating bureaucracy – such as translation – vary between welfare offices as well as between nationalities. This paper contributes to scholarship on racialized burdens by examining policy-created variation in access to the welfare state.

However, the incidence of shared versus private accommodation substantially varies both across and within countries, e.g. due to distinct administrative practices or regional contexts. This is very relevant from a policy perspective, since the first years after settling are often seen as crucial for long-term integration trajectories. In this study, we exhaust both regional and intra-individual variation in the length that refugees spend in shared accommodations in Germany (2016–2020) and provide evidence for the effects on key-integration dimensions (employment, social contacts and language skills). We use both fine-grained administrative data and high-quality survey-panel data and implement two complementary identification-strategies. First, we match districts with comparable structural contexts but different lengths of stays in shared accommodation to obtain macroscopic estimates of the effect of different housing practices. Second, we take an individual perspective by implementing a staggered difference-in-difference approach, comparing refugees who are observed to move from shared into private accommodations versus refugees staying in shared accommodation at the same time.

The linguistic and judicial complexity of German asylum appeal adjudication	Various studies have shown for several European countries that decision-making on asylum applications exhibits considerable inequities. However, there is little research on whether appeals on negative first-instance decisions are able to limit the discriminatory potential of the first decision-making stage. To close this gap, we conduct a study on the argumentative style in several thousand judgements that German administrative courts published between 2010 and 2018. Based on the judicial politics literature, we expect that the costs for asylum seekers are much larger in making their case than for the federal authorities. This increases the risk that the judicial reasoning on negative appeal decisions is less complex. Using computational text analysis, we examine the complexity of the judgements along two dimensions. First, we analyse the linguistic complexity of opinions by relying on several measures of language usage. Second, we examine the legal complexity of opinions by referring to precedent decisions and academic sources. While controlling for case and court characteristics, our analysis supports the conjecture that rejected appeals are less complex both on the linguistic and legalistic dimension of complexity.

We use simulations to study the power of recently developed difference-in-differences estimators in a small sample setting similar to the US States.

This is problematic because some polynomial orders fit the data poorly, such that researchers compare the main polynomial order to an implausible, alternative specification. Moreover, it gives researchers the possibility to only show estimates that demonstrate robustness. This paper proposes a robustness test based on a plausibility criterion. It constructs bootstrapped confidence intervals around the differences in asymptotic mean squared errors, a measure of fit commonly used in regression discontinuity papers to find the optimal specification. Using the confidence intervals, researchers can make a statistical comparison of the fit of different polynomial orders and identify which are equally plausible. By incorporating the uncertainty around the measure of fit, the robustness test also improves upon single-polynomial methods, which risk discarding relevant alternative estimates. This paper's empirical section first conducts a replication analysis which confirms that estimates in published regression discontinuity analyses are frequently sensitive to the polynomial order choice. Second, application to three regression discontinuity analyses shows how the proposed robustness test aids inference in practice.

For politics, narratives shape beliefs and present versions of political reality. Analyzing narratives is usually limited to small-N studies and are subject to researchers’ interpretation. However, because narratives have an underlying structure, computational tools can be used for their systematic analysis. Previous research has experimented with language models to predict characters in narratives, as well as extracting the timeline of the stories (Caselli et al., 2021; Stammbach et al., 2022). We propose accessing narratives via their causal arguments. Based on previous work on causality extraction models, we designed a method to extract causal arguments from political texts: we annotated the causal structure of 8,000 sentences, then used a Pretrained RoBERTa for the binary classification task, and then extracted the cause-effect pairs in the text. The binary classification model achieved an F1-score of 0.84. For political communication, this method has the potential of automating and systematizing causal arguments, which can then be used for inferences about how politicians construct narratives.

We propose a ressource-efficient alternative approach that automatically generates suitable keywords from political texts and can be adjusted to various research interests. We determine the most impactful words per topic via a voting model using three different metrics of word impact per topic. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by creating dictionaries to measure the issue salience of manifestos according to the Comparative Agenda Project’s coding scheme for Germany and the United Kingdom. Our results show high face validity and are comparable to similar issue salience measures from the MARPOR Project.

A particularly attractive approach in this setting is supervised machine learning, which involves scoring a subset of the corpus on the latent trait, training a model based on the labeled data, and then imputing scores for the larger document set. However, each of these steps comes with its own set of potential pitfalls, and the cumulative process can seem confusing or convoluted to researchers and readers alike. In this paper, we provide a conceptual overview for each step in the process of using supervised learners to measure traits in text beginning with subsetting the corpus and ending with measurement validation. For each stage, we discuss some of the important issues that researchers should consider and provide a framework to help conceptualizing the aggregate procedure. We illustrate our argument by developing and validating a measure of tone in questions asked of nominees to federal office during US Senate confirmation hearings from 1997-2019.

We offer insight into non-trivial issues of recognizing political leaders' mentions in political text, these include variations in name spelling and disambiguation of transliterated names. We offer an algorithm for identifying and disambiguating leader names and software to help researchers perform this task on political text. As an illustration of our approach, we look at the Congressional record. We identify mentions of political leaders running in foreign elections- incumbent leaders and main opposition candidates. We show that Congressional mentions of foreign leaders reflect the positions foreign leaders assume on relations with the U.S., and convey an interest in supporting candidates and democracy. This confirms and extends existing research while demonstrating the utility of using NER in political science research more generally.

The EU's poor past track record of economic crisis management is challenged by the Next Generation EU (NGEU) and its main instrument: the Recovery and Resilience facility (RRF), which supposedly innovates the governance framework regarding one of the original sins of the EMU architecture – economic coordination. We assess whether the RRF is indeed an effective mechanism for fiscal policy coordination among EU member states by examining whether functional pressures trump national priorities in the national recovery plans (NRRPs) and assessing whether the NRRPs reflect policy change toward the common priorities of NGEU. Using automated text analysis, we assess the saliency of green, digital and social priorities in (i) the recovery plans, (ii) the policy agenda of member state governments and (iii) the investment and reform agenda advocated by the 2019 Country Specific Recommendations. We provide preliminary evidence of limited economic policy coordination through the NRRPs. Our paper contributes to the timely assessment of how the pandemic recovery instruments have innovated the EMU architecture and, more generally, to the debate on reforming the EU fiscal framework.

We develop novel hypotheses concerning the direct and moderating impact of the territorial proximity of media outlets on the valence of news stories. The key argument is that subnational media outlets are more likely to frame cohesion policy stories positively compared to national media because of the territorial proximity (closeness) of subnational media outlets to target audiences and their everyday lives on the ground, especially when stories adopt a socio-economic consequences frame and EU actors are attributed responsibility for policy consequences. A mixed effects regression analysis on an original dataset from nine EU countries provides support for our expectations. Theoretical and policy implications are also discussed.

While existing research focuses on EU solidarity through fiscal instruments and migration policies, we know less about people's views concerning the largest and most redistributive EU investment policy. Drawing on an original survey of over 8,500 citizens, we investigate citizen preferences for different models of Cohesion Policy redistribution at the regional level. We find that there is very little support for the termination (or nationalisation) of EU Cohesion Policy, even in rich regions in net contributor countries. Citizens show strong support for the current ‘all region’ model of regional policy and, to a more limited extent, a more concentrated model focused exclusively on the poorest EU regions. We find that the key determinants of support for solidarity include perceived benefits, ideology and attitudes towards EU. However, solidarity is driven by different mechanisms depending on whether the region is located in a net financial beneficiary or contributor country.

The Relationship between Coalition Partners over the Legislative Period	What influences the relationship between parties in a coalition government, and how does that relationship change during the legislative cycle? I argue that time and critical events influence the position of individual coalition parties in parliament. After government formation, there is a brief period where all coalition parties have a common ground. However, the longer parties govern together, the more dissimilar they become. There are further low-points before general and even second-order elections, and during economic and military crises. I use data from the ParlSpeech V2 data set, which contains all speeches in legislative chambers in six European parliaments with coalition governments between 1987 and 2019. In order to test this theory, I use wordfish and cosine similarity to determine position, unity and similarity of all coalition partners. This paper offers new insights into how parties in coalition governments behave, and what determines their relationship to each other, which has a direct influence on government output.

However, parties that lose elections often reach office and parties that win do not. If this is such a core feature of democratic systems, are they compromised when election losers rule and winners are left out? To answer this question we focus on close local elections in Spain through a fuzzy RDD comparing contexts where the median party narrowly loses elections in which the likelihood that the plurality winner is out of government is much higher than when the median narrowly wins. We find that democracies seem to be immune to governments of election losers: no effect on turnout, fragmentation, incumbent results, or support for the far right is found. The implications of these findings are profound: they clash with the importance given in democracies to winning elections, but are also good news for parliamentary systems, where the governments require the support of majorities that go above and beyond who is the plurality winner.

However, parties that lose elections often reach office and parties that win do not. If this is such a core feature of democratic systems, are they compromised when election losers rule and winners are left out? To answer this question we focus on close local elections in Spain through a fuzzy RDD comparing contexts where the median party narrowly loses elections in which the likelihood that the plurality winner is out of government is much higher than when the median narrowly wins. We find that democracies seem to be immune to governments of election losers: no effect on turnout, fragmentation, incumbent results, or support for the far right is found. The implications of these findings are profound: they clash with the importance given in democracies to winning elections, but are also good news for parliamentary systems, where the governments require the support of majorities that go above and beyond who is the plurality winner.

Theorists have long claimed, but never systematically tested, that actors who can exploit their own and other parties’ coalition options are better able to realize their policy goals. We offer the first empirical test of this central prediction of legislative bargaining models on a broad measure of policy outputs: the fulfillment of parties' campaign pledges. Results in both multiple regression and regression discontinuity analyses show that parties that can credibly threaten to install an alternative government, implement a higher proportion of their policy pledges. Parties' vote shares and seat shares, in contrast, only influence policy outcomes insofar as they capture parties bargaining leverage. We argue that the coalition-bargaining analysis of policy-making offers a novel and useful complement to extant methods of empirical policy analysis that most often explain policy stability rather than specific policy outcomes.

Evidence from a Multi-Party Context	Social media have become an important channel for direct interaction between citizens and politicians. However, representatives are increasingly subject to insults, threats, and general incivility when doing politics online. What are the sources and the consequences of online political toxicity? This paper presents novel empirical evidence beyond the Anglophone context. Drawing on a full sample of candidates’ campaign activities on Twitter in the 2021 German national election, it analyses citizen-candidate toxicity in over 13,000 Twitter conversations (comprising over 800,000 single tweets). First, using logistic mixed effect models, I show how the amount and type of online toxicity vary by candidate characteristics as well as over citizen ids. While men and candidates running for government parties are more frequently targeted, most variation in toxicity is located on the respondent (citizen) level. Second, the paper utilizes a difference-in-differences design to measure toxicity's consequences. The findings suggest that candidates who are subject to severe toxicity reduce their tweet activity by about 15% in the following days. This is an indication that toxicity might threaten citizen-politician dialogue online, and, thereby, effective political representation.

Mainstream Party Strategies towards Challenger Parties and How Voters Respond	The rise of challenger parties poses a complex challenge to mainstream parties. I argue that mainstream parties stragically seek to delegitimize or legitimize challenger parties and that voters react to these strategies. Empirically, I test my theoretical propositions with a quantitative content analysis and two survey experiments in Sweden and Germany. The results provide strong support for my argument. Delegitimizing and legitimizing messages are a prevalent feature in mainstream parties' communication strategies towards their challengers. Citizens follow these messages in their own evaluations of challenger parties' legitimacy. Moreover, these strategies have downstream consequences on several important outcomes, such as likeability of the challenger. In sum, my results suggest that mainstream parties are powerful gatekeepers in party systems that have considerable leeway in shaping to what extent citizens deem challenger parties legitimate.

Analysing convergence and disunity in election manifestos and candidate tweets of European feminist parties.	Small parties increasingly emphasise social media campaigning to compensate for their limited visibility in traditional news media, allowing them to communicate a cohesive issue platform to a range of audiences. Yet, an increasingly personalised electoral environment encourages individual candidates to simultaneously pursue their own communication strategies, which may result in divergence from the party’s core issue profile. There is limited research on the presence, extent and consequences of disunity between small parties’ issue platforms and individual candidates’ campaign communication. To address this gap, I compare issue mentions in the manifestos and Twitter communication of three European feminist parties and their candidates during the 2019 European Parliament elections and a municipal election within each country. Feminist parties mobilise around a core ideology but promote diverse policy platforms with scope for candidates to adopt varying positions on specific policy areas (e.g., transgender rights), thus offering a relevant comparative case. Using unsupervised text analysis of election manifestos and quantitative content analysis of candidate tweets, this paper offers nuanced cross-national and cross-election insights into small parties’ strategic campaign communications.

Although these parties portray migration mainly as a cultural threat, they are expected to highlight economic aspects of migration in economically deprived constituencies. Second, this paper investigates the consequences of radical right parties' communication on migration for local party competition. I scrutinize how mainstream parties react to the framing of the radical right and whether their responses differ locally depending on the electoral threat posed by the radical right. The analysis relies on a newly compiled dataset of social media posts by candidates running in the 2017 German parliamentary elections and state-level members of parliament. The framing of these posts is first identified by using a supervised machine-learning approach before matching them with data on constituencies. This article contributes to our general understanding of local party competition, and sheds light on the electoral strategies of the radical right.

When can a party credibly change its policy on a salient issue? As the electoral environmentchanges, parties may want to change their policy positions. Even if these changes are motivated by genuine substantive policy concerns, voters may view any such shifts as mere pandering, and reduce their support for the party. We propose that voters use the direction of a platform shift as a signal about the sincerity of the party’s beliefs. Shifting to an unpopular policy position is a costly signal of principled motives, while a shift to a popular position signals opportunistic motives. We test our theory with two survey experiments using both hypothetical parties and a real case of mainstream party accommodation to the radical right. We find that platform shifts signal motivations and policy commitment in the expected ways, even when the stated policy change is giving voters what they want. This study provides an explanation for why voters prefer the original over the copy, the persistence of the radical right and the stability of issue ownership.

We tackle the issue by testing the effect of challenger status on parties’ mobilization strategies on two specific policy issues: redistribution and immigration. Our results show that in Southern Europe, where the effects of the economic crisis were most severe, challenger status increases the mobilization of redistribution for both left- and right-wing challengers. Differently in Northwestern Europe, where the impact of the economic crisis was less severe, the positive effect is weaker for left-wing parties and even negative for right-wing parties. Cross-regional differences are less marked when it comes to immigration, which is in line with the consideration that the two regions have been similarly exposed to the consequences of the migrant crisis. We conclude that the issue-mobilising strategies of challenger parties belonging to the same party family vary conditionally on the environment within which they operate.

So far, only a handful of authoritarian legislatures have been studied in light of this finding and even fewer leverage data on the observed behavior of each individual member. As a novel case in point, members of the National Assembly of Zambia (NAZ) are unlikely to achieve policy changes without the president’s approval, but this does not keep them from pursuing political goals within the institution. In parliamentary debates, the politicians regularly address issues that are specific to their own constituency, urging the national government to attend to local issues. There is significant variation in how frequently politicians from the different groupings in parliament resort to this constituency service strategy which I measure with a text-as-data dictionary approach to transcripts of parliamentary proceedings in the NAZ from 2006 to 2021. The constituency service measure provides for meaningful theorizing of elite political behavior and holds potential for causal identification in the study of authoritarian legislatures.

However, many countries have stagnated or regressed in their development of democratic institutions. Simultaneously, politically motivated breaches of democratic conduct against and between political parties remain widespread in semi-authoritarian electoral regimes. Given the key role that political parties play in negotiating constitutional change and shaping political competition in such regimes, it is essential to understand how these trends are interlinked. This project asks whether – and if so how – inter-party violence affects constitution-making processes and their outcomes. Honing in on the case of Turkey, it builds theory on the causal pathway linking dyadic partisan violence to inter-party dynamics during constitution-drafting negotiations. Based on unique data from field research in the country it investigates how these inter-party dynamics affect the process and outcome of constitution-making, as well as ensuing inter-party relations. A deeper understanding of these dynamics is necessary in order to counteract continued inter-partisan hostility and violence, as well as democratic regression.

Authoritarian Successor Parties, Party System, and Democratic Survival	Earlier research indicates that authoritarian successor parties (ASPs) are some of the main obstacles to democratic consolidation, and there is mixed evidence. This paper argues that successful ASPs can shape good democratic outcome. The strong electoral performance of an ASP enables opposition parties to coalesce around parties with anti-authoritarian origin or anti-authoritarian parties (AAPs), as a history of competition against authoritarian incumbents will make it likely to forge strong ties with their supporters. This, in turn, prevents the rise of new parties, facilitating the emergence of an ASPs–AAPs party system that creates robust interparty competition between ASPs and AAPs. For one thing, it reduces the fragmentation of the new ruling parties, which inoculates young democracies against political instability that could lead to regime collapse. For another, it can effectively check the government’s power, thus preventing a new ruling party from crossing the line from democracy to authoritarianism. This study confirms the pathway gathering data between 1945 and 2022 from 125 democracies, creating a new dataset on ASPs and AAPs worldwide, and employing mediation analysis with the survival data.

The role of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in defining legislative agendas	Recent literature on the authoritarian regime has identified an “institutional turn”. It suggests that authoritarian regimes use institutions and laws to entrench their rule. While these findings have been empirically documented, the conclusions intensively drawn from southern Asia. China, as the largest authoritarian regime, has embarked on an ambitious program of legal construction and been experimentally pioneering institutional channels for a wide scale of participation and cooperation since the 1978 reform and opening up. This paper seeks to characterise the political attention paid to different policy issues by legislators and one of the most famous think tanks, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), and how their political interests affect each other in Chinese lawmaking process. It applies and adapts the consistent coding framework of the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) to transform the laws and CASS’s reports into quantitative data. A Vector autoregressive distributed lag time series analysis with impulse response function finds that the CASS is more likely to follow, than to lead, China's legislative agenda even though the Chinese legislature has responsiveness.

Opposition coordination in authoritarian elections. Evidence from 2021 smart voting strategy in Russia	In electoral autocracies, opposition parties offer the best hope for regime change. Yet, anti-regime voters are often uncertain about the most credible alternative as the opposition is often divided, and autocrats possess the tools to coopt and repress anti-regime elites and voters. Using Alexei Navalny's smart vote campaign to coordinate voters around viable opposition candidates for the 2021 Duma elections, this article develops and tests a novel theory of anti-regime vote coordination in the absence of viable electoral coalitions. We show that the campaign improved opposition candidates' vote share but did not help them to win elections. Nevertheless, opposition candidates were electorally successful in regions where voters were highly discontent with the regime -as shown by using data on willingness to protest in support of Navalny shortly before elections. Yet, the smart voting campaign also helped the Kremlin to further hone its electoral fraud strategies. We find the Kremlin took votes away from opposition candidates recommended by the smart vote campaign, bolstered support for other opposition candidates, and left behind weak United Russia candidates.

We add to this literature by proposing that inept political communication of mainstream parties is an important and previously overlooked explanation. Voters rely more on values and less on their group belonging to make vote choices. But mainstream parties (in contrast to their challengers) have failed to use (more effective) value-based justifications for their policies and positions. Instead, they continue to rely on (less effective) traditional group-based appeals, which are rooted in now defunct class-based post-war mass politics. To test our argument, we analyze comparatively and over time how parties (in the Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria) use values and appeals to social and economic groups to justify demands in different policy areas. Using established dictionaries, we evaluate value- and group-appeals around political demands identified by regular expressions and entity recognition in party manifestos since WWII, press releases from 2010, and politicians’ tweets.

Previous research has shown that mainstream parties contribute to the success of the far right by forming coalitions or adapting far-right positions. Yet, we still lack a long-term empirical assessment of the discourse alliances between far-right actors and mainstream parties and the extent to which far-right actors influence and adapt to mainstream communication. To this end, this paper investigates the evolution and structure of their discourse networks since the 1990s in German mass media. This paper innovates by combining automated text analysis with multimodal network analysis to analyse the relations between actors and issues in mass media debates.

In this paper, we ask which actors—politicians, the media, or the public—set the rhetorical tone for how a topic is communicated about. To study who drives the moralization and emotionalization of a topic, we zoom in on the “refugee crisis” of 2015/2016 in Germany; a country seen as a moral leader in Europe during that time. We base our analysis on large amounts of fine-grained social media data from politicians, parties, the media, and members of the German public. After employing transformer models to identify moral-emotional communication about the crisis, we use vector autoregression models to explore whose rhetorical style more strongly diffuses to other actors. The results will have implications for understanding whether politicians have the power to set the tone of debate or whether they mainly mirror public or media discourse.

However, research still lacks a clear understanding of when parties appeal to groups rather than referring to more abstract concepts such as policies and issues. I address this research gap by building a theoretical model that makes the case that it is a strategic choice to either use abstract concepts or group appeals. Either referring to groups or to concepts serves as a mean to manage the politicization of specific issues. I test my theoretical model with a text-as-data approach, measuring the use of group mentions compared to abstract concepts. I use this measure of personification to examine how British, German, and Austrian parties speak about unemployment and immigration in parliament between 1984 to 2022. This study has important implications for the study of the strategic use of political rhetoric and for the representation of vulnerable groups in politics.

The paper analyses the populist challenge to the rule of recognition of the liberal democratic system of the Hellenic Republic in the early years of the economic crisis (2010-2014). The main assumption is that the rule of recognition, which according to legal positivism and HLA Hart is the foundational rule of legal systems, provides a stable and fundamental point of reference for the measurement of the populist impact and the classification of the populist challenges from a legal perspective. By reference to the rhetoric of the main populist opposition leaders in the period 2010-2014, the paper will:

However, little is known about how mainstream parties can respond to such rhetorical challenges and whether they would benefit from talking populist themselves. I conduct a vignette survey experiment in Germany (n = 4,000), randomizing the use of populist rhetoric and radical policy positions to understand how voters react when mainstream parties engage in populist rhetoric and/or adopt extreme positions. The results show that voters' party preferences are strongly influenced by the policy positions that mainstream parties adopt but not by the type of rhetoric they engage in. Voters reward or penalise mainstream parties conditional on the alignment between the party's position and their own issue preferences. However, whether mainstream parties engage in populist rhetoric does not affect voters' evaluation of a mainstream party. These results bear good news for democracy: The vast majority of the electorate is not fooled by the seemingly simple worldview that populist rhetoric offers and penalises mainstream parties once these adopt extreme policy positions.

Yet, including information beyond words like audio and video signals promises to reflect the richness of human communication more comprehensively. To make full use of this information, the different data streams are ideally aligned with one another. Using neural networks with self-attention, we show how to automatically transcribe multilingual text and map each word to its exact beginning and end in audio and video recordings. Exploring aligned modalities unlocks promising analytical leverage. First, it allows to measure new concepts, e.g. the speed of utterances. Second, it opens the door to a more fine grained measurement of emotions including humor, sarcasm or anger. Finally, it is possible to answer research questions that span multiple modalities. For example, what political positions and which emotions do parliamentarians display when they establish eye-contact with populist factions in their speeches? We illustrate the utility of this approach with recordings from UN Climate Change Conferences and the German Bundestag. Our paper offers important insights to all keen to effectively analyze multimodal data.

However, recent work on this technique has highlighted the risk of different forms of design effects, all of which can lead to inaccurate and potentially misleading estimates of the prevalence of the sensitive item. In this article, I use data from a series of list experiments conducted in Russia in 2021 to illustrate that these design effects can be endogenous to the political processes of interest in the list experiment. In these experiments, the form of design effect varies based on the salience --- and sensitivity --- of the item being estimated in the list experiment. These results indicate that design effects in list experiments can be context-specific and thus difficult to predict, diagnose and mitigate.

The clarity of messages is crucial for effective politicalcommunication. In democracies, where politicians are accountable tocitizens, they strategically adjust communication quality depending ontheir constituent demographics. Does a similar logic work inauthoritarian contexts, where elites are primarily accountable to anautocrat? We argue that authoritarian politicians are more likely torepresent complex policy issues through simpler language when theyface not the less educated---what scholars have found fordemocracies---but the more educated, of a higher socio-economicstatus, constituents. This is because elites who address a moresophisticated audience also deal with a more pro-democratic andprotest-prone constituency and are motivated to use a more persuasivelanguage. In contrast, authoritarian actors use more complex languagein poorer regions with less educated population, where they do nothave to account to their constituents. Drawing on a new dataset ofRussian governors’ annual addresses in 2007-2021, we find strongsupport for our argument: elites from more developed regions speaksimpler and more congruent with their role as politicians, in contrastto the loyalty-oriented leaders of the poor regions.

Previous studies from China suggest that such ``hard propaganda’’ can deter citizens from engaging in anti-regime behavior and provoke emotional reactions. However, questions remain about the scope conditions of these findings from one closed, dominant party regime -- does propaganda work similarly in other types of authoritarian regimes and uniformly so for the whole population? We run a pre-registered survey experiment in (competitive authoritarian) Turkey to assess how hard propaganda videos affect different emotional states and political behavior for government supporters and opponents. We find that exposure to such propaganda does affect emotions: opponents report to be more angry, whereas it increases the feeling of group belonging for supporters. Concerning political behavior outcomes, hard propaganda seems to only partly deter opponents from joining anti-government protests, but can encourage supporters to write pro-government posts on social media. Our results thus highlight that power-projecting propaganda in competitive authoritarian regimes is not only restricted to discourage opponents from joining anti-government action but may also help mobilize supporters.

We argue that an independent outlet in an autocracy will only risk bypassing state censorship when the perceived costs of compromise outweigh the perceived costs of confrontation. Otherwise, independent outlets may strategically choose to mirror state-run coverage. We illustrate this phenomenon using text-as-data methods to analyze the news content shown by the state-controlled Channel1 and the independent TV Rain in Russia between 2011 and 2021. Our results suggest that TV Rain is more likely to contradict Channel 1 narrative when covering domestic activities of those who oppose Putin’s regime. At the same time, TV Rain may mirror some elements of the state propaganda when covering other issues that are not directly related to the fight with the regime. We hypothesize that strategic mirroring has an added benefit of attracting and retaining new viewers who would otherwise not consider TV Rain as their chosen source of information.

In this paper, we argue that China can promote its costly carbon emission policy through nationalist propaganda that appeals to international competition. Using an online survey experiment with over 2000 respondents across mainland China, we find that the nationalist propaganda focusing on US-China competition increased public support for China’s carbon emission policy, as long as the cost of the policy is not relevant to individual citizens. Furthermore, propaganda can also increase their trust in the government and their willingness to support international collaboration on environmental issues. This study provides evidence of how China can successfully solicit public support for its ambitious environmental policies, which is critical for global efforts to combat climate change, given China’s huge carbon emissions. More broadly, this study reveals how authoritarian governments can promote costly policies by utilizing propaganda strategies.

Previous studies on media representation of separatist movements showed that the state generally adopted two framing strategies: victimizing the state and highlighting ethnic or religious boundaries between “us” and “them”. However, the situation in the Chinese context became trickier with its narrative of a harmonious and powerful state. Previous research on media representation of Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong finds that Chinese state media adopt a more inclusive narrative and depict the central government as a strong, caring, and defensive entity like the head of the family. Based on the case study of the Chinese National Daily Broadcast’s reports on the 2019 Hong Kong protest, I find that CCP emphasizes the boundaries between “us” and “them” based on differences in political stances rather than demographic factors. Moreover, rather than victimizing itself, China framed itself as a paternalistic, benevolent, and caring regime which endures the local chaos and supports the development of Hong Kong. This research contributes to theories on framing strategy and crisis management of authoritarian regimes.

I articulate a flexible but coherent framework that draws on existing literature from media economics and journalism to reflect the supply-and-demand realities of a given social media platform. I use YouTube as the central case study and demonstrate how to adapt the framework to other platforms. The thesis is that tightened feedback loops between media creators and consumers means that these two types of actors are always affecting each other, in contrast to the broadcast media paradigm in which the flows of influence were heavily tilted in one direction. To understand the dynamics of a given platform, then, it is essential to model the platform affordances, the composition of the audience, and the mechanisms for audience feedback---in addition to the beliefs and incentives of the media creators.

The use of delegitimization to ‎de-establish the legitimacy of the political rival is present even in societies with high ‎support for democratic norms.

The paper ‎emphasizes the destructive potential of political delegitimization discourse, which ‎may create a sense of shame and repudiation of‎ political ‎identities. The endpoint of ‎these processes may be the eradication of ‎certain ideas from public discourse and the ‎prevention of any ideological objection – an antithesis to a functioning democracy‎.

However, the rapid growth in encryption technologies has also allowed illegal activities to be conducted anonymously, undermining governments’ law enforcement capabilities. Cryptocurrency, in particular, plays a key role as it challenges state surveillance power and it facilitates a broad range of illegal activities. Consequently, encryption and cryptocurrency have become increasingly politicized, with little consensus regarding the appropriate scope of regulation. In this context, a central aspect of the politics of privacy and surveillance is the discourse that contributes to making cryptocurrency a political issue. To study this question we focus on Reddit, a platform that is highly relevant for cryptocurrency discussions.

I introduce the concept of frame competition and argue that a given issue can be more or less beneficial for parties, dependent on the dominant framing. I test this argument by estimating the similarity of media coverage about migration to parties' migration framing with document embeddings, using data from Germany 2013-2019. Combining this similarity measure with VAR models, I show whether higher frame similarity is associated with better performance in the polls. The findings broaden our understanding of voting behaviour and the strategies political parties can employ in the face of a hostile issue agenda.

Making sense of framing patterns in protest coverage	Existing research indicates that when mainstream news media report about demonstrations, protesters often face delegitimising coverage that focuses on, for example, clashes with the police or the appearance of protesters instead of their message. Recent studies have also found, however, that media treatment differs along several features of protest events. I test the influence of all known features by combining a large scale automated framing analysis on protest events from the UK and data from the Mass Mobilization Project (MMP). I find four main determinants for the use of legitimising or delegitimising framing in news coverage about protest: (1.) violent protests get more delegitimising coverage, and less legitimising coverage; (2.) the goal of a protest matters for the kind of reporting it receives, yet relationships between frames and goals are complex and goals overall matter more for legitimising frames; (3.) the type and ideology of an outlet — although to a much smaller degree than expected; and (4.) reports published more recently and longer after the start of an event have a higher chance of containing legitimising framing.

Previous research has established that the regional environment of the “street-level bureaucrats” and the national salience of migration are major sources of discrimination against ethnic minorities. Drawing on the discrimination and framing literatures, we examine how reports about welfare fraud at the national and the regional level affect administrative decisions on welfare benefits. Our theoretical framework suggests that the discriminatory framing of welfare fraud by regional newspapers is more decisive in activating the in-group bias of the responsible case workers. To investigate this relationship empirically, we conduct a vignette experiment with street-level bureaucrats from a representative sample of 60 out of 405 German job centers. Using randomized name assignments of welfare benefit applicants, the experiment will show whether the several hundred caseworkers are more likely i) to delay and reject applications from ethnic minorities, ii) whether the decisions depend on a negative media frame, and iii) whether this potential effect is more pronounced for regional rather than national newspaper reports.

Drawing on theoretical and empirical approaches to disability as well as examples of candidates’ campaign material, we develop a set of frames which candidates are likely to use. We propose that, in addition to not addressing their disability at all, the most relevant strategies of disabled candidates are to (i) normalise their disability to avoid being othered; (ii) frame their disability as evidence of individual strength and resilience; and (iii) emphasise the value of their experience of systemic barriers. In a survey experiment with a factorial design and hypothetical campaign leaflets conducted in the US, we test whether and how these three frames affect citizens’ evaluations of the traits and representativeness of disabled candidates as well as their electoral support.

This poses the question of whether women are now more easily seen as embodying the ‘good politician’ as voters may reward or punish different candidate traits conditional on the sex of the candidate with a positive bias towards women. For instance, are female politicians rewarded more than males for being seen as authentic, or for being seen as having integrity? We study this question using conjoint experiments in seven countries. We show that across all candidate traits, women are preferred relative to men, and this is not conditioned by respondent sex. We argue that bias against female politicians, where it exists, is not from voters, but more likely from the media environment or the supply of politicians.

A visual survey experiment	People have varying opinions of what good leaders look like and how they act. According to the US leadership prototype, leaders are regarded as most effective and desirable when they demonstrate stereotypically male or white attributes. However, research on whether perceived candidate masculinity affects vote choice and personality attributes is equivocal. While race and gender have powerful influences on how people view candidates, other physical characteristics can also affect voters' judgments. In this study, I will experimentally explore the influence of perceived facial masculinity on candidate preference as a predictor of being a good leader, controlling for the race and gender of the candidate. In the United States, a visual choice experiment will reveal that appearance-based cues may influence candidate choices in which computer-generated candidates are randomly assigned validated facial masculinity modifications. I anticipate discovering that perceived facial masculinity favours Caucasian women the most, followed by Caucasian men but not African American women, and disadvantages African American men when competing against another candidate of the same gender or race but with fewer masculine characteristics.

Femininity, Masculinity, and Vote Choice in a Comparative. Perspective.	Do voters exhibit gender bias against women political candidates? Drawing on theories of gender bias, gender stereotypes, and role congruity, I conduct a choice experiment in four South East Asian countries to examine how voters respond to political candidates who deviate from gendered norms. My theoretical contribution is to recognize that gender norms affect candidate choice beyond simply the sex of the candidate, as a preference for a male candidate might not necessarily be a preference for men but a preference for masculinity. Likewise, an apparent preference for a female candidate might not reveal a preference for women but a preference for femininity. Overall, I find evidence of a gender bias in favor of women candidates. When it comes to how voters evaluate candidates who deviate from gender norms, I find that voters tend to evaluate women and men candidates with the same attributes similarly, except for their approach to politics – voters prefer a woman candidate with a tough approach to politics. These findings have important implications for candidates of all genders and the party elites who recruit them.

For multi-party systems like Germany, however, polarization is more multi-faceted, and issue positions are non-exclusively divided between multiple parties. Besides parliamentary speeches for issue positioning, social media have become a crucial individual communication tool for political elites like members of parliament. Due to platform affordances, social media may incentivize more extreme issue positions in political elite communication. This study characterizes individual and party-level differences across modes of political communication of German members of parliament. The study builds on a unique data set that links a candidate survey with parliamentary speeches and MPs' communication on social media. The analysis assesses issue positions by German MPs on Twitter and Facebook and compares the individual positions and aggregated party positions in a multidimensional analysis to issue positions in parliamentary speeches. Then, it assesses the relationship between the text-based issue positions to issue position responses from the candidate survey.

On the causal relationship between cross-partisan conversations and affective polarization.	Rising levels of affective polarization pose a threat to the functioning of Western democracies and could erode social cohesion. The most prominent antidote against this development discussed by scholars, journalists, and practitioners alike is to foster cross-partisan conversations which could lead to more empathy, reduced stereotypical views of opposing partisans and in turn reduce hostility towards other parties. Most of the research has been conducted in the context of the US in the form of experimental designs. In addition, there is limited research on the longevity of these effects. To review the transferability and external validity of the findings in extant research, I apply panel matching methods to a seven-wave panel survey from the German multiparty context containing information on respondents’ everyday political conversations. Analyses affirm that cross-partisan conversations substantively reduce affective distances towards outgroup parties in the German context. Contrasting findings from experimental research, I further illustrate that the effects persist over up to four months indicating the depolarizing potential of these encounters across party lines.

We study the causal effect of increasing the transparency of parliamentary speeches on polarization and other speech patterns. Our research design utilizes the 1989 introduction of TV broadcasting to those Finnish government's parliamentary question hours that were held during the first Thursday of every month. In contrast, the question hours held on other Thursdays of the month were not televised until 2008. We calculate our main outcome, yearly polarization, with LASSO-penalized distributed multinomial regression and analyze the effects of TV broadcasting in a difference-in-differences framework. We find no evidence that televising of question hours affects polarization between the left-wing and right-wing parties, within-party group differences, topics discussed, and for the most part, who gets to speak in the Parliament. In addition, we find no evidence that TV cameras would make discussions more heated, measured by the number interruptions MPs make to other MPs. Our results suggest that politicians and parties do not strategically respond to increased visibility in a polarizing way and thus there is no trade-off between increased transparency and polarization in this context.

In contrast, the question hours held on other Thursdays of the month were not televised until 2008. We calculate our main outcome, yearly polarization, with LASSO-penalized distributed multinomial regression and analyze the effects of TV broadcasting in a difference-in-differences framework. We find no evidence that televising of question hours affects polarization between the left-wing and right-wing parties, within-party group differences, topics discussed, and for the most part, who gets to speak in the Parliament. In addition, we find no evidence that TV cameras would make discussions more heated, measured by the number interruptions MPs make to other MPs. Our results suggest that politicians and parties do not strategically respond to increased visibility in a polarizing way and thus there is no trade-off between increased transparency and polarization in this context.

This suggests that the welfare state is fairly successful in fulfilling its protective role and individuals who become dependent are prevented from becoming more politically distrustful. However, political trust tends to deteriorate if the welfare state misses to help the people worrying about risks.

Yet, in many young democracies, parties fail to fulfill this key responsibility, providing neither accountability for poor politician performance nor effective and accurate representation of citizens’ preferences. Drawing on a large-scale field experiment with a party in Ecuador, in which citizens are given an opportunity to provide feedback on the party’s platform, this paper explores how different forms of participation affect citizens' willingness to become and stay engaged politically as well as the quality of participation. It shows that both participation through individualized participation (through an online platform) and communal participation (through deliberative assemblies) increase citizens’ sense of political efficacy and interest in politics. Furthermore, both forms of participation increase citizens’ support for the party and future engagement with it. The findings elucidate ways in which parties can (re)gain political trust and foster activism and they and have important implications for broader debates about democratic inclusion and representation.

While previous research has mainly focused on the effect of protest on electoral outcomes, attitudes towards social reforms have scarcely been analyzed. We delve into this question by examining the events that took place in Chile in October 2019, when the country experienced the most important protest cycle of its recent history, known as ‘Estallido social’. After almost one month of protests, which included violence from the State and the rioters, as well as several deaths and injured, the government and most political parties signed an agreement to begin an unprecedented constituent process. Did protests lead to a change in attitudes and behavior towards social reform? To retrieve the causal effect, we combine several methodological approaches, including an unexpected event during survey design (UESD) and a diff-in-diff strategy on electoral returns. Our manuscript has important implications for understanding the effect of protests on political attitudes and behavior.

In this paper, we revisit the question of why protests demobilize. Based on previous research highlighting the role of emotions for mobilization, we ask whether regulated emotions explain protest demobilization at the individual level. To test this mechanism, we conduct online experiments that randomly assign respondents to protest participation, which varies their ability to regulate negative emotion. We find support for the expectation that emotion regulation through protest decreases the likelihood of further protest. This raises a crucial puzzle: Factors that initially contributed to why individuals start protesting are diminished through this activity, which in turn reduces protest participation.

What affects voters' confidence in election outcomes? Recent events in varied democracies -- from Kenya to the United States -- demonstrate that voter confidence in elections matters. Research on the determinants of voter confidence, however, remains fractionalized across sub-fields, both topically and methodologically. For instance, Americanists focus on partisanship and, to a lesser degree, voter experiences at the polling station on election day. Comparativists tend to examine legal challenges, political violence, and electoral fraud. While all of these factors may shape voter confidence in an election, we have little sense of their relative impact. Our work bridges these diverse foci across sub-fields, seeking to understand both (a) the relative effects of many factors on voter confidence and (b) how these effects vary across different national contexts. This project reports the result of a multi-country conjoint experiment in which respondents are confronted with randomized election and post-election scenarios. These scenarios feature both """"""""micro-level"""""""" determinants of voter confidence (like election-day experiences) and """"""""macro-level"""""""" determinants (like legal challenges or candidate concessions).

We examine this by employing data from a unique, and comprehensive surveys on SV with over one million responses worldwide. We explore to which extent current surveys reflect actual tendencies of SV by comparing common SV and rape survey questions with more nuanced, and fine-grained ones. Additionally, we use open-ended questions on episodes of sexual violence to detect forms of SV that have been overlooked by previous surveys. Our findings indicate that the magnitude and diversity of SV cannot be detected by existing survey data, and that the typical rape questions in surveys under-report rape by an average of 50%. Our results have broad implications to the study of SV.

A twitter analysis of members of parliament in Germany, UK, and Sweden	Since the start of the pandemic, experts around the world have warned that individuals living in abusive households may be at greater risk of harm during lockdowns due to increased unemployment and isolation in the home. While several governments throughout Europe recognized the issue at hand and many increased funding to support victims, the issue of gender based violence has become highly politicized and weaponized against immigrant groups and minority cultures. In this paper, I look at how gender based violence is framed by members of different political parties and when and how the framing is used to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. I hypothesize that the far right political parties will be the most likely to discuss gender based violence in relation to immigration related issues, but that even among the left, gender based violence will at times also be tied to issues of immigration. However, the expectation is that the far right will discuss gender based violence with immigration at higher rates than any other party.

This article examines the ability of social norms, and in particular, gender norms in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, to quickly and lastingly shift. I test whether significant local shocks may push some societies towards a deviation from their social norm, while similar societies remain static and stable in the absence of such disturbing force. In Sweden, the country was particularly shocked by allegations of sexual harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault on the 24th of November 2017, which led to salient discussions about systematic gender-related violence and harassment. This paper estimates the impact of the Arnault scandal on attitudes towards women´s rights, by exploiting individual-level survey data from the European Values Study 2017. Using both a regression discontinuity and a differences-in-differences approach, I find a sharp and long-lasting upwards movement on Sweden, while no significant change is found in Denmark.

Evidence from India's Randomized Reservations	We explore whether the implementation of gender-based electoral quotas across Indianvillage councils affects access to justice for those seeking help from the state, especially women. We use an unprecedented dataset of individual-level police reports from 2015-2021 of a major Indian state to explore differences in registration patterns across ‘treated’ and ‘control’ councils or gram panchayats. We then merge these records with district court files to trace the full trajectory of complaints across the entire criminal justice system. In so doing, we aim to estimate the causal effect of the quota policy not only vis-`a-vis the narrow question regarding the process of reporting (e.g., police filings), but also in terms of final outcomes (i.e., judicial verdicts). To shed light on mechanisms, as well as place citizen voices at the center of our research agenda, we complement our statistical analyses by applying machine learning and text-as-data techniques on victims’ first-person testimonies to law enforcement.

While formal gender equality is advancing globally, gender-based violence, and sexual violence more particularly, remain an important epidemic. Crucial to this epidemic is its detection. Under which conditions do victims of sexual violence perceive themselves as such? Does the ‘objective’ experience of sexual violence automatically translate into a perception of having suffered this violence? We argue that while this may be the case generally, particular factors may encourage/hinder the correct perception of this phenomena. We posit that the relationship with the aggressor, the type of violence suffered, repetition and partisanship may shape sexual violence identification. Using a unique and comprehensive survey of sexual violence victimization, with over 500,000 responses, we find supportive evidence of our argument. Results suggest that the type of sexual violence, the relationship with the aggressor and partisanship matter to sexual violence identification. Our findings have broader implications to the study of sexual violence, but also the current political climate of an increasing feminist movement and gender backlash.

The use of deliberate misinformation is thought to have played a role in the outcome of the UK EU referendum, elections, and in COVID-19 public health messaging. However, in this paper we make a novel contribution to the literature by examining the sharing and detection of everyday non-partisan fake news across a myriad of topics and social media platforms. Results show that even our well-informed sample (political science students) were not immune to the effects of fake news, some issues (e.g., health and crime) were more likely to be shared than others (e.g., immigration), and on specific platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). We also show that individual differences in emotional stability appears to be key in sharing behavior, while rational thinking aptitude was key to fake news detection. Taken together, this study provides novel data that can be used to support targeted fake news interventions, offering news topic, sharing behavior, and platform specific insights.

This article asks how politicians themselves can speak against abusive comments from citizens on social media. Using a factorial survey experiment in Denmark (N=2000), we study situations where one politician is exposed to insulting, threatening or sexist comments and another politician intervenes to (i) express empathy with the victim, (ii) emphasize prevalent norms about abuse, (iii) or warn about its democratic consequences. Our study suggests that counter speech by politicians can move public opinion about whether (potentially) abusive comments to politicians are acceptable or not. However, our study also suggests that counter speech effects depend on the party affiliation of the politicians involved. Specifically, abusive comments towards politicians from liked parties, where an in-party politician intervenes, are deemed least acceptable, while similar comments to politicians from disliked parties, with an out-party politician intervening, are deemed most acceptable. The implications for democratic politics are discussed.

Yet, there are also explicit calls for simpler political discourse, expressing worries about politicians' overly complex talk. These concerns may seem contradictory at first, but co-exist on different levels: the form is too complex (inaccessible) and the content too simple (unsophisticated). Existing work on the effects of these discourse characteristics in the political realm is scarce, tends to focus on one of the two types, and presents mixed findings. As a result, we still lack insight into how different forms of simplicity and complexity impact the way citizens think about politics and perceive politicians. To better understand the separate and combined effects of these two dimensions, a preregistered 2x2 experiment was conducted (N=2000). Respondents were presented with (un)sophisticated and (in)accessible excerpts from fictional election debates, followed by a thought-listing exercise and measures of political attitudes. Preliminary results indicate that unsophisticated discourse negatively impacts reasoning tendencies and the image of politicians. In contrast, inaccessible language does not seem to have the same negative effect.

In view of that, the present paper aims to assess whether observing politicians that shame the media affects the attitudes of media consumers, reducing the credibility of the content of the news and altering their trust in the media outlet. Based on studies on party cues, confirmation bias and media selectivity, we argue that shaming an ideologically distant media outlet will be more effective when this act is performed by a politician appreciated by citizens and when the media outlet retains a weak reputation in their eyes. Focusing on news related to immigration, issued by one left-wing and one right-wing newspaper, we test our hypotheses through a vignette survey experiment administered, on a sample of 4000 respondents, in two countries, Norway and Italy, to account for differences related to the nature of media system, partisan media, and the level of political parallelism between media and politics.

I propose a shift in discussing post-truth dissociating it from the misinformation objective facts dichotomy to associating it with discourse. Building on this fundamental shift of theorizing post-truth as discourse, I design an online endorsement survey experiment to be administered to a random sample of 800 people in the UK recruited from Prolific securing gender balance. The survey estimates the effect of post-truth rhetoric on voters’ decision to uphold their political position. Specifically, I test citizens’ level of trustworthiness associated with post-truth accounts communicated by political parties and their decision to uphold their political position. The survey uses variations of rhetoric vignettes (post-truth, lie, and facts) to estimate the effects of post-truth rhetoric on trustworthiness perceptions and voting intentions.

This paradigm shift in political representation and its democratic implications is severely under-explored in empirical political science. Therefore we set out to investigate the effects of unelected representation through routes to representation. We conceptualize the routes to representation as; descriptive representation, through demographic congruence, substantive representation through issue congruence, and psychological representation through personality congruence. We conducted a conjoint experiment in Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Romania (N=8279) and found support for all routes to representation. Importantly this paper highlights that unelected representation can influence how citizens feel represented and that there are several routes to experience this representation. Importantly, we also uncover detours to representation as the effect of issue congruence is largely dependent on individual and contextual factors. In conclusion, we provide a novel perspective on unelected representation and set the stage for new models of representation.

Based on the current literature, mostly drawn on case studies, it is still not clear whether populist leaders downplayed the adequate response to the crisis (Wondreys & Mudde, 2020). Against this backdrop, this paper investigates how medical populism, as a type of ideology amidst a health crisis centred on distrust in scientific evidence (Lasco, 2020), affected COVID-related policies. Drawing on a novel large-N time-series cross-sectional dataset, this paper seeks to a) identify whether populism plays a role in explaining the variations in health and economic support responses and b) disentangle political ideology from populism effects. I compiled data on policy, populism, political institutions, state capacity, ideology and health outcomes covering 147 national governments in 121 countries over 32 months. The paper further exploits federal contexts where governors have significant autonomy on policy, by relying on a comparative quantitative case study with Brazil and the USA. Therefore, the paper sheds light on populist policy responses in times of crisis in a comparative perspective.

Quasi-experimental evidence from Spain	In the last decades support for the far right has surged in countries all over the world. One of the explanations of this success alludes to voters’ reaction to the policies implemented by mainstream parties, although it is unclear which are more likely to fuel their advance. On the one hand, conservative policies can legitimize far right parties’ agenda and pave their way. On the other hand, progressive policies can backlash as right-wing voters might polarize and look for more extreme alternatives as a counterbalance. In this paper we investigate the causal effect of the partisanship of the incumbent government on the electoral results of radical right parties. We focus on close local elections in Spain and the emergence of the far right party Vox. We compare radical right success following a narrowly-winning left-wing (right-wing) government through a regression discontinuity design. We find that municipalities exposed to left-wing policies increased the vote to the far right in around 4 percentage points. This evidence suggests that progressive policies might backlash by providing incentives for conservative voters to support far right parties.

(Alternatively, is British politics intrinsically populist?)	Definitions of populism have tended to involve long lists of characteristics drawn from diverse cases (see summaries in Canovan 1981 and Laclau 2005). Most include opposition between the “pure people” and corrupt elites (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017). However, populism has another simpler meaning in political theory – it is simply the belief that “will of the people” exists and should be followed (Riker 1981). Following Canovan (2002), I will argue that it is better to define populism strictly in those terms, and that all the other characteristics are epiphenomenal. Once you accept the idea of the “will of the people”, you can explain the emergence of the other characteristics in the appropriate circumstances. While drawing on Canovan’s (2002) analysis, I dispute the idea that non-populist forms of democracy are less appealing because they are opaque and harder to understand. This seems to be empirically untrue. Support for democracy in countries with more pluralist or pragmatist forms of democracy remain high. A viable alternative ideology of democracy does exist. The “crisis of democracy” is actually the crisis of populist, winner-take-all democracy.

We turn to the Italian Movimento Cinque Stelle, arguably one of the most relevant populist parties, which followed the unusual practice of coordinating all political activities on a public online platform. We webscraped the entire event history of the Movement's more than 1,000 local branches with over 200,000 geocoded political activities to study how the staggered local emergence of M5S chapters affects electoral turnout. Using staggered difference-in-differences models on election results and surveys spanning thirty years, our preliminary analyses suggest that the rise of M5S decreases turnout. Our findings have important implications for the study of turnout in contemporary democracies and the negative consequences of populism in the electoral arena.

The detrimental effect of PR electoral systems on the right’s political representation	Electoral systems have an impact on parties and voters’ ideology as well as public policy. Previous literature argues that PR systems are more likely to benefit the left (Iversen and Soskice 2006). According to Rodden (2019), geography is the crucial driver of the right’s advantage in elections held under majoritarian rules: the concentration of left-wing voters in urban districts produces an overrepresentation of right-wing parties in legislatures elected through majoritarian systems. However, his evidence is practically confined to the US and factors other than geography are neglected. In this paper, we show that left-wing parties maximize votes and seats under PR, particularly when the average district magnitude is high, and its variance is small. We also test whether other variables such as strategic vote or malapportionment play a role to explain these patterns by examining empirical evidence from 20 OECD countries between 1945 and 2018.

Despite being subject to criticism from various authors, it does not seem to have lost in popularity or reputation. There may be a variety of reasons for the continued popularity of this index: (1) that it gives the """"""""right"""""""" results, (2) that its construction is conveniently simple and easy to understand, (3) alternatives often involve complicated substantial and methodological considerations that seem intransparent to most applied researchers, and (4) criticisms usually are buried in appendices of methodological papers that propose alternatives.The paper addresses this situation by highlighting the (implicit) assumptions behind the RiLe index and by demonstrating some paradoxical implications of these assumptions: The better the fit between these assumptions and reality, the more the RiLe index both exaggerates and occludes the actual movements of political parties. The consequences of these distortions are illustrated by a re-analysis of recent publications.

Most accounts of these changes focus either on declining social cleavages or on parties’ issue strategies. However, mainstream parties may also be less successful in appealing to ‘responsibility voters’: segments of the electorate that care about valence outcomes and competence. We argue that, while these voters have traditionally been a main source of mainstream party success, they have increasingly turned towards new competitors. This is because responsibility voters privilege parties with governing experience, but the number of such parties has increased due to the fragmentation of party systems, increasing the choice set of responsibility voters. This broader choice set also has implications for how voters react to competence signals, e.g. good or bad economic conditions. To test our theory, we use the example of Social Democratic parties and provide new evidence from a choice-based experiment and observational data from the European Election Study. The tests show whether party system change has self-reinforcing effects on mainstream party decline.

While voters in multi-party systems respond to attacks on the honesty, integrity, and competence of political actors, it is unclear whether and how political parties use these valence attacks strategically. I argue that valence attacks are more likely to occur in multi-party systems when they appear legitimate to voters. I connect the vast literature on spatial competition with the one on valence attacks and argue that incumbency and issue ownership increase the public perception of legitimacy and make attacks more likely. Using data from 24 recent elections in ten European countries, I show that valence attacks in multi-party systems focus on incumbents and are predominantly connected to substantive issues. These findings have important implications for the literature on valence attacks by parties as well as the one on strategic position taking in electoral competition.

How are female brokers compensated relative to men? We analyze panel survey data from party brokers affiliated with Ghana’s ruling party. Our descriptive results demonstrate that women brokers are much rarer than their male counterparts, but are also selected by the party based on different characteristics. In terms of payment, women brokers are much more likely to be compensated for their activism than men brokers despite, on average, doing less work for the party.

Institutional and partisan drivers of the appointment of women to government expert committees	Experts play an influential role in policymaking in advanced democracies. While we know a lot about women’s advancement in politics, far less attention has been paid to women as policy experts. To address this gap, we study governmental appointment of women to policy commissions. We argue that gender quotas with enforcement mechanisms are likely to be crucial for women's inclusion, particularly in traditionally male-dominated policy areas. For women to become chairs, however, we argue that quotas are a less effective tool, which means that government ideology, policy area, and the gender of the appointing minister becomes more important. To test these conjectures, we use a novel dataset containing the full universe of top-level ad hoc advisory policy commissions (“NOUs”) and their members in Norway from 1970 until 2020, i.e., 13,000 members across 1,500 commissions. We find that quotas increase women’s representation when mechanisms of enforcement and veto points have been established. We document mixed support for the role of female ministers and partisanship. This paper helps uncover a key but overlooked source of gender bias in government policymaking.

Many of the concerns raised pertain to oversight and ethical issues introduced by contractors performing public sector services, but I argue that the contractor workforce itself raises important issues worthy of consideration. Specifically, the “blended workforce” of contractors and bureaucrats affects understandings of bureaucratic representation. Additionally, the presence of contractors in the workforce may bias bureaucratic decisions toward contractor preferences. To evaluate these claims, I compare the representativeness of the contractor and bureaucratic workforces using a novel dataset that compiles data on individual contractors working at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1992 - 2016. I evaluate the contractor workforce vis-a-vis the bureaucratic one on three dimensions: gender diversity, racial and ethnic diversity, and ideology. I then consider a complication introduced by the blended workforce: contractors can become bureaucrats (and vice versa). I evaluate the frequency of the “contractor revolving door” and consider its consequences for the EPA and beyond.

An experimental study of the preferences and ambitions of public servants	Worldwide, the share of women employed in public administration is nearly equal to that of men. However, women are rarely seen in top-level management. Studies suggest that women may be more reluctant to apply for high-paying and powerful positions due to differences in job values, preferences and needs. Generally, women tend to value time flexibility and meaningful work, while men tend to value higher salaries and career development. Since public servants deviate from other employees in a number of ways, it is essential to investigate whether this also applies in a public setting. In this study, we intend to do just that, by employing a conjoint choice experiment to investigate the job-related preferences of thousands of public servants in Denmark. By varying different theoretically relevant attributes such as time flexibility, salary level and social environment, we will be able to detect possible gendered differences and to what extent this correlates with leadership aspirations. This will further our understanding of why there is still so few women in top-level management and guide future research that wish to mitigate this inequality.

A number of studies has shown that poor government performance gives RRPs an electoral edge. In this article, I argue that RRPs strategically undermine local public goods provision to trigger dissatisfaction among voters. County administrations are a key provider of tangible public goods like roads and schools which constituents rely on every day. While voters use the condition of public goods as a heuristic to gauge government performance, most are oblivious to local political processes. This makes local public goods a promising target for RRP obstructionism. I test this argument using fine-grained finance data from German counties between 2006 and 2020. Employing Difference-in-Differences estimators, I find that county councils with AfD members spend substantially less per capita in real investment. Additional analyses show that this is driven by the strategic behavior of the AfD, and test the generalizeability of the findings. These results have major implications for our understanding of how RRPs affect policy making and democratic governance, even without holding majority power.

This has presented a dilemma for the populist radical right: how do challengers respond when the public is no longer aligned with their position on a core wedge issue? Analysing an original dataset of party press releases from nine European countries and 68 parties over a decade, we use supervised machine learning techniques to create dynamic measurements of issue salience, party positioning and emotive framing of the refugee issue.

Which impact do anticipated changes to these public goods have on people's trust in government and fundamental beliefs in democracy? Research on bureaucracy suggests that public administrative organizations play a key (macrosocial) role in stabilizing and legitimizing democratic political systems by providing essential public goods and services. In this respect, I use a major, original dataset collected in five OECD countries (the United States, Germany, Spain, Poland, and Sweden) to assess the importance of public goods to citizens’ lives and trust in government. Through a conjoint experiment I show that the quality of public goods and services is as important (or even more important) to many citizens as other key (personal) aspects of their lives. Then, through a survey experiment, I demonstrate that information about anticipated changes in public goods and services makes citizens concerned about the future and increases the importance of public goods to their trust in government. Additionally, there is also some (more limited) evidence of an impact on their fundamental beliefs in democracy.

We investigate whether that translates into increased electoral salience on the voter level by analyzing the pattern of issue salience separately for voters at both extremes of the issue dimensions. Using data from the ESS 2016 and the CHES, we show that immigration policy is highly salient in most European countries, but that this is most pronounced among voters with pro-immigration attitudes. This suggests that in the context of large refugee movements radical right parties' issue emphasis provoke strong reactions on the opposing side of the immigration issue dimension. For the environmental issue, the pattern looks differently. Except for the Nordic countries, the issue is generally less salient, but in Central European countries, at least the pro-environmental voter group regards it as important in their vote calculus. Further, there is a large overlap between pro-immigration and pro-environmental voters, which will make issue expansion of green parties more likely.

We leverage access to all 2.7 million comments submitted to a large Swiss online medium in 2021, both published and unpublished, to evaluate the impact of one such design choice: requiring users to register for a user profile in order to comment. To identify the effects of the registration wall, we use both a regression discontinuity and a difference-in-difference design. We find that introducing a registration wall for commenting (a) did result in a short-term dip but had no longer-term repercussions for user engagement; (b) did not reduce toxicity or harmful speech; but (c) changed users’ mode of engagement, reducing their propensity of replying to existing comments. Together, these results suggest that both hopes for a more civilized discourse and concerns about decline in user engagement associated with registration walls might be exaggerated.

There is considerable overlap between populism and nostalgia – i.e. both share the idea that it used to be better. To determine whether nostalgia is really a new “kid on the block”, explaining populist support, we rely on Dutch data, conducted in May 2022. Utilizing an EFA, we explore how many latent dimensions those concepts share. The results show two underlying concepts, while using a PCA, we find a single latent concept with seven components. This indicates that there is not only considerable theoretical overlap between the concepts, but also empirically, these concepts pick up on the same meaning. To overcome conceptual overlap, we deconstruct the dimensions of nostalgia using experimental and observational data. This allows us to theorize and empirically investigate how nostalgic rhetoric impacts political behavior. Understanding the nostalgic component in rhetoric allows us to contribute to the literature on drivers of populist support.

While party manifestos, social media posts and leader speeches are widely utilized for such studies, election debates, which have been held regularly since the 2010 general elections, have received surprisingly little attention when examining this case. This study sets out to fill this gap by empirically investigating the different foci and contexts in which political actors engaged with populist discourse in televised election debates in the last four elections. Using Discourse Network Analysis, it explores the configuration of actors and the structure of the contents of discussions on the defining concepts of populist ideology (such as """"""""the people"""""""", """"""""elites"""""""", """"""""independence"""""""", """"""""democracy"""""""", """"""""crisis"""""""" and the like). Doing so, the study aims to provide new insights into the relational (and perhaps reciprocal) dynamics of populist contagion in contrast to the one-directional and linear diffusion envisioned in the literature.

The cultural backlash theory developed by Norris and Inglehart answers this question based on the slow process of value change arising from generational transformations that deepen the cultural cleavages. In particular, they argue that older cohorts hold more authoritarian-populist values and vote more often for authoritarian-populist political parties. In this paper, we put the cultural backlash theory and value-based explanations of authoritarian-populist support to the test using a conjoint experiment in Montenegro. The previous work measured the outcome variable, support for authoritarian-populist parties, in two steps: i) ask the individuals which party they voted for in a survey, ii) ask the experts to locate the parties on the authoritarian-populist scale. In this study, we offer a novel methodology and measure that linkage directly by using authoritarian/populist campaign promises as attributes in a candidate choice experiment. We first show that the authoritarian/populist value measures diverge significantly. We then provide evidence that although older cohorts hold more authoritarian/populist values, they do not seem to be more responsive to authoritarian/populist campaign promises.

However, most misinformation studies focus primarily on false information that has become widespread. The focus on successful fake stories does not allow researchers to understand why some fake news pieces do not become viral despite the effort of some political leaders to promote them. We theorize that individuals might fall for false information in addition to partisan reasoning because it resonates with prevalent local beliefs and attitudes. We test this hypothesis by comparing the predictors of belief in misinformation of two false stories spread by the extreme right President Jair Bolsonaro during the covid-19 pandemic. The results of a nationally online representative survey with 2601 respondents support the hypothesis that partisan reasoning alone is insufficient for a fake story to become widespread. Only false stories that resonate with locally held beliefs gain traction. The results have significant consequences for the fight against misinformation as it points out the need to consider locally held beliefs to frame counter-corrective messages.

Extending recent research on psychological biases for vivid social information we argue that competitive exposure to just a single exemplar can crowd out the effect of statistical evidence on policy preferences. However, we further propose that politicians and citizens process this information in different ways, with citizens attitudes being much more susceptible to change in the face of information about the impact of policy. We test the predictions in two studies including pre-registered online survey experiments fielded to a population sample of politicians running for national office and to approximately representative samples of citizens.

SMI can capitalize on their often enormous outreach to influence people’s perceptions of given issues, which turns them into a useful pawn for actors who strive to foster misperceptions.

We first scrape the timelines of all German- and English-speaking influencers with more than 500000 followers on Facebook and Instagram via Crowdtangle. Second, we then use various computational strategies to single out and classify the content SMI may have been hired to distribute. This project therefore sheds some first light on the extent to which SMI actually partake in ‘disinformation-for-hire’ versus ‘information-for-hire’, a supposed booming business, triggering growing and serious concerns.

Using questions from a representative US survey (CES 2021), we find that respondents who are more confident in their ability to detect fake news are more likely to perceive the media as increasingly biased. We then measure people’s actual ability to identify false information and find that it is negatively associated with the perception that news has become more biased. Based on these findings, we propose that improving media literacy could at least partially restore Americans’ trust in the news.

We challenge this convention and propose that a globalization shock can incentivize disadvantaged populations to learn about its distributional effects. Of these groups, we suggest that internal migrants have the greatest incentives to educate themselves due to their unique combination of capacity to move and experience with discrimination upon arrival. To test our hypotheses, we field a randomized experiment in Vietnam by exposing half of a large nationally representative sample of respondents, including 812 migrants, to uncertainty about the effects of Vietnam’s entry into the European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). We then monitor willingness to learn by tracking whether respondents access an online video laying out the distributional impacts of the agreement. We find that treated migrants were 180% more likely to seek greater knowledge than those in the control group but find null effects for all other residents and members of vulnerable populations. Effects are strongest for relatively low-skilled “opportunity” migrants, who were pulled, not pushed, into the high growth manufacturing sector.

To test our hypotheses, we field a randomized experiment in Vietnam by exposing half of a large nationally representative sample of respondents, including 812 migrants, to uncertainty about the effects of Vietnam’s entry into the European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). We then monitor willingness to learn by tracking whether respondents access an online video laying out the distributional impacts of the agreement. We find that treated migrants were 180% more likely to seek greater knowledge than those in the control group but find null effects for all other residents and members of vulnerable populations. Effects are strongest for relatively low-skilled “opportunity” migrants, who were pulled, not pushed, into the high growth manufacturing sector.

On one hand, urbanization can foster economic development and improve more efficient provision of essential public goods and services. On the other hand, urbanization can pose substantial economic, social, and political challenges, increasing oftentimes already strong inequalities as locals compete with newcomers. In this paper, we investigate the perceptions of both migrants and urbanites: When are migrants discriminated against and under which conditions? What, in contrast, are factors that help integration into the new societies without increasing inequality? Using original survey data from Kenya and Vietnam, we show that the reason why someone decided to migrate in the first place is crucial for whether she/he can successfully integrate. Especially, individuals who became migrants because of social reasons, such as family ties or other social networks, find it significantly easier to overcome (potential) inequalities. In contrast, migrants in search of economic opportunities or escaping adverse environmental conditions reinforce existing inequalities as they have few opportunities for a sustainable livelihood at their new place.

We also investigate words and phrases that had negative or positive partisan connotations in particular periods. Finally we examine whether some of the common hypotheses offered in the literature can account for the changes.

Examining the Association between News Coverage of Interest Groups and Organizational Ties to Parties	Getting media attention is an important strategy for interest groups when seeking to gain traction for their views among political decision makers and the public at large. Media attention is scarce, however, and previous research shows that this attention tends to be directed toward groups with more organizational resources, yet also to depend on issue-level characteristics. We build on this and argue that interest groups are more likely to succeed when they have (stronger) organizational ties to political parties. Such ties facilitate collaboration between the actors on specific issues, allow for coordination of media strategies, and enable the actors to draw on each other’s media networks. We examine the relationship empirically across four European democracies (Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK) at the general level and level of policy areas. We test our hypotheses using survey data on party-group ties and data on group and party presence in the news across 12 different newspapers from 2016-2018. Our results speak to research on interest group strategies, the effects of party-interest group relations on democracy, and bias in media attention.

At the party level, we expect that electoral gains are more likely to be attributed to leaders for challenger parties than mainstream parties, while electoral losses are more likely to personalized for mainstream parties compared to challenger parties. Lastly, election results are more likely to be reported in personalized ways than attributed to parties as collective actors in candidate-based electoral systems compared to party-based electoral systems.

In September 2011, Peru became the first Latin American country to adopt a law regulating indigenous peoples' right to be consulted regarding administrative or legislative measures that may affect them directly. Since then, more than 60 consultation processes have taken place, leading to agreements between indigenous communities and the government regarding national laws, infrastructure, national protected areas, as well as the development of energy projects. I focus on consultations regarding the creation of oil blocks in the Amazon to measure the effect of a policy that recognizes indigenous peoples' rights over their territories on theirrelationship with a state they have been traditionally disengaged from. Using rich micro-level data and a difference-in-differences design, I estimate the causal effect of prior consultations on indigenous peoples' political participation and willingness to interact with and become legible to the state. Results indicate that while ethnic recognition has the potential to increase engagement with the state, poor implementation has turned prior consultations into a lost opportunity.

But why are some cities more segregated than others? In this paper, I explore the political origins of class-based segregation. I argue that federal policies that restructure urban housing markets have differential effects across cities. Depending on how the timing of these federal policies (i.e., critical junctures) coincide with local mayoral coalitions that happen to be in power at time, cities become more or less segregated. Using a close-elections RDD and a unique panel survey of municipal governments, I first show that under housing market liberalization in the 1990s, centrist mayoral coalitions increased evictions of the poor and segregation, while left-wing coalitions, instead, reduced segregation. In contrast, the effect of partisan coalitions flips during the roll-out of the social housing program, Minha Casa, Minha Vida: left-wing coalitions increased segregation, while centrist and right-wing coalitions reduced it. The findings highlight the unintended consequences of popular social housing programs, and how the motivations of the local Left have contradictory effects at different points in urban history.

We theorize a novel mechanism, we call asymmetric mobilization, which explains mobilization as a self-selection process induced by a broadly targeted benefit. Asymmetric mobilization is based on incomplete information of citizens about the de facto allocation of benefits. When citizens expect particularistic allocation, and access to the benefit depends on voter registration, supporters of the incumbent, who supplies the benefit, self-select into the electorate. This creates an incumbency advantage. We illustrate the argument using the case of the Renda Básica de Cidadania (RBC) in Maricá, Brazil, the largest unconditional cash transfer program in Latin America. Based on qualitative evidence we develop our argument in a formal model, which we test against novel survey data. We find that under the de facto procedure of implementation, supporters of the incumbent supplying the RBC, self-select into the electorate, and engage more in activities, which signal party loyalty. .

However, little attention has been paid to variations in constituency-specific nomination strategies adopted by parties even under the same selection rules, and their consequence on post-election legislative behavior. I argue that regardless of the mechanism of candidate selection, constituency parties apply different restrictive and permissive candidacy benchmarks for electorally safe and vulnerable constituencies respectively. In constituencies where the threat of defeat is low, parties restrict candidacy to highly loyal members. Conversely, selection in swing constituencies tends to be more inclusive. Additionally, restricting candidacy induces post-election parliamentary focus while opening up intra-party competitions engenders constituency focus. I analyze these claims in the Ghanaian context using the NPP's 2020 parliamentary candidate selection. I draw on a range of empirical evidence including interviews and media-data. The analysis demonstrates that, in the NPP’s safe constituencies, candidacy was restricted to loyal members, who consequently exhibit minimal constituency effort. On the other hand, MPs who focus less on plenary activities but more on the constituency went through permissive selection procedures in swing constituencies.

A Comparative Analysis	Facing an ongoing decline in their public image and connection to voters, many parties seek other means to improve their electoral fortunes. Past studies identified the adoption of primaries as one such method. The logic is simple: by democratizing candidate selection procedures, parties can increase their legitimacy, raise participation, dispose of seemingly corrupt and convoluted institutions, and improve their popularity, public image, and media coverage. Yet do primaries provide an electoral advantage in reality? In this paper, we provide a first systematic analysis of this question. Using comparative panel data on party candidate-selection methods over time, as well as a conjoint experiment gauging voters’ electoral priorities, we examine whether and to what extent the adoption of primaries contributes to parties’ electoral success. The paper contributes to our understanding of the nexus between party institutions and electoral performance in an age of weakening party-voter ties.

In this paper, we study the effect of elite cues on non-compliant behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the effect of a series of controversial tweets sent by US President Donald Trump calling for the """"""""liberation"""""""" of Minnesota, Virginia and Michigan from COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Leveraging the fact that these messages referred to specific states, we adopt a spatial difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of elite cues on non-compliance behavior among in-group partisans in targeted areas. Despite stay-at-home orders in effect in all three states, we find that Trump's calls to action increased both recreational mobility and anti-lockdown protests in the following days. Importantly, we document an increase in mobility in the Trump-targeted Republican counties even when considering only Republican counties around the country as a counterfactual, illustrating the localized and exclusive effects of elite cues. Our findings demonstrate the mobilization capacity of US President Trump specifically and the importance of elite cues for political behavior during crises more broadly.

We combine computational methods for text and inferential network analysis to trace how arguments on an issue spread among actors, platforms and media types.

A growing literature is arguing that classical government advantages in political communication are fading. Gatekeeping and indexing are said to diminish, even if governments remain a privileged source of information for journalists and stakeholders. The """"""""hybrid"""""""" media system is more dispersed and therefore much less likely to facilitate government preeminence. While many observers will share these statements, empirical evidence to back it scarce and hard to get by. This paper lays puts forth a methodology to explore government discourse on policy as weel as discours on policy in general. It uses state-of-the art textmining techniques to track policy coverage in print media to test those techniques. I test this method on a sample of French print media outlets going back to the early eighties. While the main goal of this contribution is essentially descriptive, it provides insights into why and how governments may lose control over the coverage of certain issues rather than others.

So far, scholars do not know much about the underlying patterns in this case and in which policy-fields which Commissioners make women visible. To approach representative performances by individual Commissioners, I build on representative claim theory, measuring claim-making on behalf of women. I develop the expectations, that women Commissioners make more representative claims than men Commissioners, especially in portfolios associated with feminine stereotypes. I test these expectations through a representative claim analysis to a corpus of 15,000 speeches by European Commissioners from 1986 to 2021, quantitative content analysis, and regression analyses on the representative-claim-making. First, I find that women Commissioners are significantly more likely than men to claim to represent women. Second, if they do so, the claim-making patterns are gendered, women Commissioner´s claims more often refer to “feminine” portfolios than their men colleagues. I contribute to the literature on women´s representation in the EU, by confirming that women make women visible (differently), which is especially important in light of the Commission´s function as agenda setter.

While it is a symbolic act, maiden-speeches can affect legislators' status. A successful speech may elevate the legislator's position, while a poor one will not. This paper examines how women and men legislators present themselves in maiden-speeches in parliament and analyzes legislators' initial goals and aspirations. Women are still seen as unfit to deal with crucial policy issues, and distancing themselves from """"""""soft-issues"""""""" and from discussing their personal experience may compensate for their low starting point. By juxtaposing women legislators' speeches with men's, this paper aims to delineate which agendas women promote and the personal experiences they describe. Using a computational method, we analyze a dataset comprising all the maiden-speeches from Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and Australia during 2006-2020. Our analysis indicates an overall gap in the dedication to issues between women and men, and that women tend to focus more on personal experience than men. Our preliminary findings contribute to the literature on representation and, specifically, how women use maiden-speeches to elevate their status.

Are women more or less likely to be interrupted in parliament?	The number of women in parliament is growing slowly, but steadily; increasing women’s power in parliament. However, power not only means being present: it is also about being seen and treated as a politician. In our paper we ask whether men and women are treated equally while using one of the most important tools of a politician: parliamentary speech. Building upon the feminist neo-institutionalist idea that parliament is a gendered institution where the masculine norm is still dominant, women are still perceived as ‘space invaders’ interrupting the dominant norm. This can trigger different resistance techniques. Following this argument, we hypothesize that this may cause politicians to completely ignore and neglect women while speaking, leading to fewer interruptions. Using longitudinal parliamentary speech data from Australia, Croatia, and the UK our results corroborate our expectations. We find that the probability that women are interrupted is significantly lower compared to men. This effect is even stronger for women in the position of cabinet members. Overall, the study shows that even when women are present in parliament, they are still treated differently.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the declining effectiveness of antibiotic medicines due to misuse are among the biggest threats to global health and a major challenge for global governance in this century. Since drug-resistant bacteria spread easily across borders, government policies that exacerbate or mitigate AMR profoundly affect other countries. Global public goods, such as maintaining antimicrobial protection, are notoriously difficult to provide. International organizations and governments chose to address AMR by creating a soft governance regime largely devoid of legally binding rules and enforcement mechanisms. This paper presents a cross-national empirical assessment of the effectiveness of the international AMR regime combining novel data on national action plans and data on antibiotic consumption in 191 countries between 2000 and 2018. We find that the regime sets ambitious goals and achieves broad participation, substantial implementation, and meaningful change in the use of antibiotics. The involvement of the largest consumers of antibiotics has been crucial for both effectiveness and equity. Sustained progress in mitigating AMR is possible if the number of governments fulfilling policy commitments continues to grow.

To achieve this goal, originator firms adopted different strategies to identifying constructing regional and global manufacturing networks and transferring technology to production partners. Originator firms also allocated their output differently, in terms of their supply to national governments and multilateral purchasers. This paper analyzes these different approaches to global production and allocation, focusing on the relationship between vaccine developers and their funding sources. The analysis speaks to the establishment and enforcement of conditionalities attached to financing, a key area of importance in international political economy, though one traditionally not applied to analyses of global health.

We argue that innovation reduces policy autonomy among national governments in two ways. First, lower barriers to entry create opportunities for forum-shopping by researchers, firms, and other actors. This facilitates regulatory arbitrage as actors evade national rules by relocating to more permissive jurisdictions. Second, public unease about new technologies creates the potential for backlash against controversial applications. This backlash can spill across borders: accidents or misuse in one jurisdiction undermine support for research and commercial development elsewhere. Together, these processes can generate inefficient cycles of accelerated progress disrupted by damaging controversies. We test these mechanisms in the case of gene editing, finding support for the theory in data on scientific employment patterns and a survey experiment examining public backlash. Our results demonstrate that technological disruption increases interdependence and undermines states’ ability to regulate in isolation.

Unlike assessed contributions, which are allocated at the WHO’s discretion, voluntary contributions can be earmarked by the contributing member for specific categories, programs, even recipients. Although intergovernmental organizations are often discussed as actors that enable the pooling of resources and coordination of policy, reliance on earmarked voluntary contributions hinders these organizations agency. This is particularly problematic for an organization like the WHO, which is expected to respond quickly and effectively to health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines how COVID-19 affected member contributions to the WHO, and in turn, WHO programming. Using a unique dataset, I analyze changes in member contributions prior to and during the global pandemic, comparing contributions to WHO projected program budgets. The results suggest that despite budget increases, that the use of earmarking by members providing voluntary contributions remained unchanged.

We randomly assign Palestinian and Jewish students (Study 1: N > 400, Study 2: N > 600) enrolled in over 20 English as a Foreign Language university classes to work in heterogeneous (Palestinian-Jewish) or homogeneous pairs during class. To measure student achievements, each student completed an assignment independently assessing their pair learning. To measure intergroup attitudes, we administered questionnaires following the intervention. We discuss findings as well as implications for promoting minority achievement in unequal and divided societies.

We randomly assign Palestinian and Jewish students (Study 1: N > 400, Study 2: N > 600) enrolled in over 20 English as a Foreign Language university classes to work in heterogeneous (Palestinian-Jewish) or homogeneous pairs during class. To measure student achievements, each student completed an assignment independently assessing their pair learning.

However, the linkage between war time violence, specifically, and gender norms has yet to be systematically investigated at the level of the individuals, who comprise society and who engage in social processes which are guided by and reinforce norms of gender (in)equality. To this end, we conduct a list experiment measuring emigrant Russians’ attitudes toward gender inequality and war time violence, including gender based violence. We test two treatment conditions: one related to gender inequality and another to the respondents’ support for the conduct of war in Ukraine.

We also analyse whether feminism is portrayed with ambivalence, or whether frames have evolved into a more positive treatment following the 4th wave.

A survey experiment from Sierra Leone. (Provisional title)	How do citizens sanction unelected traditional leaders? In societies where the socio-economic and political spheres are embedded, I expect citizens to use sanctioning channels that affect the chiefs' economic, social, or political power. I expect that citizens choose sanctioning mechanisms according to their relative costs and effectiveness. I test these hypotheses using a survey experiment in two rural areas of Sierra Leone, in which I randomly select two hundred households at each site. The experimental design disentangles how sanction mechanisms operate, grasps the diversity of sanctioning practices according to citizens' social and economic status, and identifies whether the chiefdom's structure moderates sanctioning practices. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first experimental work that offers the possibility to deepen our understanding of the varieties of bottom-up check-and-balance mechanisms between citizens and non-elected leaders.

Citizens face competing claims when an incumbent undertakes autocratic action. The autocratizing incumbent claims there is a sound justification, while pro-democracy actors (‘democratic defenders’) assert it erodes democracy. We examine how citizens evaluate these competing claims. We argue citizens judge the ‘democratic quality’ of an action based on the strength of an autocratizer’s justification and the credibility of the democratic defender. In addition, some actions more blatantly attack democracy, while others are more subtle. We therefore expect blatancy to have a moderating effect on the autocratizer’s justification and the defender’s credibility. We present a factorial experiment to test these arguments.

Specifically, do citizens believe that there is a freedom-efficiency trade-off between democracy and autocracy? Whereas we already know that democracies perform better than autocracies, we know little about how ordinary citizens view the relative performance of regime types. I answer these questions and fill this gap drawing on descriptive survey data from twelve democracies. I employ direct questions as well as experiments correcting for social desirability bias. Preliminary results show that approximately every other citizen perceive that less democratic regimes are better equipped to increase economic growth and deal with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. Meanwhile, a large majority of citizens believe that more democratic regimes are better equipped to ensure political rights and freedoms. Thus, many citizens indeed perceive that there is a freedom-efficiency trade-off between democracy and autocracy. This perception is undesirable, not only because it is inaccurate, but also because the priority attached to efficiency may increase in harder times or during crises.

Many comparative studies have discussed the politicization of slum governance through the lens of electoral competition. This paper asks whether a similar logic of power maintenance exists under non-electoral regimes like China. I empirically focus on Beijing’s slum demolition campaign in late 2017, suggesting that the campaign served as a coercive tool for political leaders to remove illegibility and prevent disobedience. Combining qualitative materials, I find that this practice of preemptive coercion emerged out of the unwritten but widespread fear among all levels of officials that illegibility harms political stability. I further establish a unique dataset based on satellite imagery, digital street view, and site visits. The quantitative evidence confirms that a slum’s survival chances decreased as it became less legible to the government. These illegible communities were (1) large-scale unities, (2) located far away from local police stations, and (3) equipped with stores and restaurants for personal interactions. This paper builds the connection between legibility politics and slum governance in social sciences.

We created an original dataset from the 2020 US state legislative elections, which includes 7,000 individual candidates from 45 states. The dataset combines candidate- and district-level characteristics. The analysis produces interesting findings. First, on average, LGBTQ+ candidates perform at least as well as straight and cisgender candidates in election outcomes. Second, lesbian women obtain on average over 5% more of the vote than straight candidates. Third, LGBTQ+ candidates do better in Democratic-leaning and highly educated districts, as well as in districts with a higher share of Black voters. This is because LGBTQ+ candidates who make it to the general election are above average candidates, who have greater political experience and are more successful fundraisers than their straight counterparts. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these findings indicate that LGBTQ+ candidates are an asset for their party in many districts and powerfully challenge claims of greater homophobia among Black voters.

If seniority dictates electoral success and career promotion, but advantages men who enter politics earlier and advance more quickly, this could explain why so many countries have low shares of women in politics. We test this theory using individual-level panel data on political careers and elections from 1921 to 2021 in the case of Norway, a country that over the course of a century has almost achieved gender parity. We show that Norway's major parties operated a two-tiered seniority system that was gender-biased, and we document a selection effect by which early female entrants to politics had to be significantly more educated than their male counterparts. Only after the introduction of gender quotas in party lists, and when Norway's parties began to operate their seniority systems in a gender-neutral way, did gender parity improve. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the long-term process of achieving gender parity in representation.

Whereas the literature often attributes women’s underrepresentation in elected office to voter discrimination and low levels of political ambition, I show instead that limited opportunities to gain early political experience shape the emergence and success of female candidates. Examining a natural experiment from Mexico, where female candidates were randomly selected and placed in elected office, I find that women who have gained initial experience in office (at random) are much more likely to seek and attain subsequent elected positions than men who have held similar office or women without such experiences. The findings highlight the importance of early political experiences in overcoming gender disparities among candidates and elected officials and have important implications for broader debates about democratic inclusion and representation.

We study these questions in the context of the influx of Ukrainian refugees into Poland over the course of Russia’s war on Ukraine that began in February 2022. The warm welcome that Ukrainian refugees received in Poland contrasts sharply with the treatment of refugees from the Middle East. In this study, we leverage a nationally representative survey with 2,500 Polish respondents. Using a survey experiment, we activate shared experience of displacement and suffering (of Poles in World War II) to learn how these factors affect assistance to refugees. In a conjoint experiment, embedded in the survey, we explore whether people are more likely to assist refugees who are more racially or culturally similar to them or whether helping is more a product of the perceived humanitarian need. We find evidence for the important role played by empathy and shared experience of violence and displacement on individuals’ willingness to assist refugees.

Coalition building is an important lobbying strategy, particularly for poorer and more socially disadvantaged interest groups, but how do they choose their coalition partners? I use quantitative text analysis to measure coordination between groups lobbying for the rights of asylum seekers and other interest groups in Germany. I apply Wordfish, a scaling algorithm for analyse texts based on word use and frequencies, to compare linguistic similarities between position papers submitted to policy consultations. Papers with similar Wordfish scores are likely to express similar arguments, and therefore to be part of a coordinated network or coalition. My analysis shows that asylum rights lobbyists' positions are similar to each other, and distinct from those of others such as business or labour groups. The results indicate a homogenous coalition-building strategy, suggesting that asylum rights groups are unable to overcome institutional or ideological constraints on coordinating with other groups to form potentially more effective, diverse coalitions. I further corroborate my findings with elite interviews. These constraints have important consequences for the ability of asylum rights groups and other disadvantaged interests to successfully influence policy.

We study this issue in Turkey, where approximately 1.7 million out of 3.4 million Syrian refugees are children. The project focuses on two primary questions, utilizing experiments implemented on a representative survey. First, we consider whether Turkish citizens demonstrate a preference for child refugees over adult refugees. As part of this question, we test several mechanisms that may drive this preference, analyzing whether child refugees are perceived as more likely to integrate, more deserving of sympathy and assistance, or less threatening to Turkey’s economy, social stability, and national security. Second, we implement a conjoint experiment to study which Syrian refugee children are more likely to be viewed favorably by Turkish citizens. By shedding light on the factors that shape attitudes toward child refugees, our work informs academics and practitioners interested in social cohesion between refugee and host communities in Turkey and elsewhere.

To understand refugee migration, some work studies refugees’ intentions and others their behavior. Although these studies are often framed as if they get at the same question, this should not be taken as a given. Although we have a clear sense of what voluntary refugee return should look like, we have limited evidence on the conditions under which refugees are actually able to exercise this right by linking their intentions and behavior. In order to develop our theoretical and empirical understanding of this issue we present novel evidence on when intentions predict behavior or not, and what drives behavior to deviate from intentions.

We study time trends in people’s migration intentions and behavior and the impacts of major shocks in Lebanon and Syria.

However, the vast majority of refugees are in developing countries. Moreover, while these interventions focus on individual processes of attitude change, attitudes often do not shift in isolation; people are embedded in rich social networks. To test whether a perspective-taking intervention that has reduced prejudice towards refugees in the United States is also effective in a developing country, and to assess the relevance of social processing after the intervention, we conducted a field experiment in northwestern Uganda, host to roughly one million refugees. We find that in all four study villages, perspective-taking changed short-term, individual attitudes to be warmer towards refugees on average. Furthermore, the treatment effect not only spills over from treated households to control ones along social ties, but peoples' attitudes change based on informal conversations with others after the treatment. The findings show the importance of understanding the social process that can reinforce or unravel individual-level attitude change towards refugees; it appears essential to designing interventions with a lasting effect on attitudes.

To address this research question, the study investigates the frequency of various crises (financial crises, natural disasters, military conflicts, famines, and epidemics) and their effects on autocracy and democracy. This study analyzes the relationship using a unique data set of global crises.

To address this research question, the study investigates the frequency of various crises (financial crises, natural disasters, military conflicts, famines, and epidemics) and their effects on autocracy and democracy. This study analyzes the relationship using a unique data set of global crises.

This presents an important gap in the literature since authoritarian rulers—particularly those in competitive authoritarian regimes—have increasingly come to rely on elections and parties to consolidate their power. Moreover, the patterns of interparty competition observed in previous authoritarian regimes have been theorized to cast long shadows that continue to shape the party system—and by extension the performance and resilience of democratic institutions—even after democratization. However, there is currently no comprehensive measure of the concept that extends to non-democratic regimes. In this paper, I use a Bayesian latent variable measurement approach to develop a novel measure of PSI that covers both autocracies and democracies. I then use this measure to examine the implications that PSI has for regime stability in autocracies, and how the legacies of interparty competition established under these regimes contribute to prospects for successful democratic transition and consolidation.

However, empirical evidence on the topic remains scarce, and mostly confined to autocracies. To bridge this gap, this project studies the impact of female local leaders on the development of the female anti-regime movement in Poland. Using close municipal elections, I estimate the causal effect of female mayors on anti-government mobilization, in the context of the 2020-2021 wave of women's protests for reproductive rights. Regression Discontinuity regressions show that the presence of female mayors significantly fosters anti-regime protests in Polish towns. Additional analyses shed light on two potential mechanisms: Female mayors reduce the costs of protesting by removing administrative obstacles as well as providing an informative signal about the prevalence of equitable gender norms in the local community. These findings highlight the importance of local leaders in coordinating political activism and influencing the social and political attitudes of ordinary citizens.

In this paper, we rely on an original dataset to measure the renewal of elites in the Spanish transition called the “Spanish Transition and Late Francoism Dataset.” Our dataset contains more than 600 profiles of the main figures of late Francoism, as well as those leading the Transition. We have collected the relative importance of each of the jobs that different kind of Francoist and Transition elites had before and after the democra- tization process, gathering information on more than 5.000 jobs over 40 years. By studying the interaction of several variables over time, we show which elites of Francoism were more likely to remain in prestigious positions, what were the factors associated to remain influential, and to what extent the Spanish democracy changed hands after democratization. Our results suggest that while there was a change in political elites after the Transition, economic elites remained the same.

However, democratization scholars overlook insights from ethnic and conflict studies, illustrating that inequalities between identity-based groups (generally, ethnicities) can be correlates of political developments like civil wars. Systematizing from autocratization cases and building on past contributions, the paper demonstrates that inequalities between ethnic groups are also favorable pre-conditions for a country to start autocratizing and experience a regime change towards autocracy. I consider both autocratization and ethnic inequality as complex concepts: the former as any downturn in the level of democracy and as a regime change; the latter articulated in political, economic, and social dimensions. With a global sample of countries since 1981, and an original data collection, the article hypothesizes that democracy is overall less resilient and more prone to breakdown in ethnically unequal countries. Presenting survival analysis models explaining autocratization onset and regime change, I found more substantial impact of ethnic inequalities on both autocratization types when different dimensions overlap. The paper contributes to autocratization research, giving nuances of the cross-cutting cleavage theory as stabilization for democracy.

This paper addresses this gap by utilising 58 semi-structured interviews with former and current parliamentary assistants. This study focuses on the interplay between staff members of parliamentary offices when working on political communication. The paper aims to answer the following research question: How is political communication on behalf of parliamentarians organised and undertaken within the parliamentary office? The distinction between groups and teams has been particularly helpful in getting an insight into the inner-office dynamics. While groups are characterised by a clear division of labour and individual accountability, teams feature much more flexible roles and stronger interaction by their members. The findings show that parliamentary offices are idiosyncratically organised and shaped by the parliamentarians’ preferences. Their choice can significantly impact the professionalisation of parliamentarians' political communication.

Considering that PPG entry is among the most common forms of party switching, as demonstrated by the original dataset built by the INSTAPARTY project, in this paper, we examine PPG entry in three Central and Eastern European countries (Lithuania, Poland, and Romania) since the early 2000s. Building on the literature on legislative party switching, we test an argument that electoral concerns of both the MPs considering the entry and the potential receiving parties play an important role in driving entry. We examine, among others, the role of parties’ popularity in polls, election proximity, and the affiliation of the MP with a minor/new party. Our findings contribute to the research on legislative party switching and the rise of the importance of independent politicians in contemporary democracies.

Against this background, we argue that patterns in sequences of protest events are the observable implications of interactions between dissident activity and state repression. We expect that similar patterns in protest intensity repeat across spatial and temporal units and can therefore help predict the future course of the protest cycle. Using data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project for India, a baseline ARIMA model is applied to predict the number of protest events per PRIO-GRID-month. Based on moving window analysis, we shift time sub-sequences with Dynamic Time Warping, which yields a more accurate measure of similarity between series. Using the k-Means algorithm, we extract clusters of similar time series, and assign every observation in the data to one cluster. This reveals common patterns in sequences of protest events. In support of our theoretical expectations, including these clusters as additional covariates in the ARIMA model improves out-of-sample performance.

Starting with Mundlak (Econometrica 1978) and reinvigorated in the class of multi-level models in a series of papers by (all or subsets of) K. Jones, A. Bell, and M. Fairbrother and others, the ability to separate what are nominally long-run [between] and short-run [within] for stationary panels of data has led to significant advancements in the analysis of panel data. To consider non-IID errors, the paper examines the deployment of ARMA error structures to study temporally dependent processes and compares the use of ARMA and GEE estimators for such problems. To consider more general dynamics in such models, the paper extends arguments regarding the desirability of distributed lag structures to this class of models. Rather than a focus on dynamics or heterogeneity, as is the modal approach to panel data at present, this method simultaneously account for dynamics and heterogeneity in reasonable T non-spatially correlated panel data.

We draw on vignette and conjoint experiments embedded in a unique, large-scale (N=6,600) survey implemented in Germany and France, shortly before the Russian invasion, experimentally varying normative, strategic and economic costs and benefits of stylized arms transfers. Then, we contrast voters' assessment of the aspects of weapons transfer with their locations at the left-right dimension as well with their vote intentions.

Crafting Solidarity Discourses in Poland and Slovakia During the Ukrainian Crisis	The main purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast responses of Ukraine's neighbours before and during the crisis. I will focus on practices and discourses of Polish and Slovak politicians. Both countries have expressed steadfast support for Ukraine, and both have accepted many refugees fleeing from the war. However, while the Poles were criticizing Russia and blaming the Russian government for the war, some Slovaks were skeptic about NATO and willing to maintain amicable relations with Russia. Thus, comparing practices and discourses of these two neighbours of Ukraine will contribute to our understanding of solidarity building among NATO and EU members during a crisis. The paper tries to give an answer to three questions: i) What were the initial reactions of Poland and Slovakia; ii) How were Russian attacks portrayed by politicians in Poland and Slovakia?,and iii) How did politicians build solidarity with the EU and NATO during the crisis? To answer these questions, the paper uses speeches, interviews and statements of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers of Poland and Slovakia.

How Regional Wealth and Covid-19 Impact Shape Public Support for EU Risk Sharing	The Covid-19 pandemic has caused an economic collapse, leading to the largest European fiscal stimulus package to date, and has revived public debate on European fiscal integration policies. However, the effects of regional contexts on citizens’ opinions towards such policies remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this research analyses European citizens’ preferences towards multidimensional fiscal capacity instruments by combining regional-level indicators with data from a conjoint experiment conducted during the first wave of the pandemic in five countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands) with 8570 respondents from 87 regions. The results indicate that regional self-interest moderates individual preferences; citizens in poorer regions, or regions more affected by Covid-19, are more likely to support integration policies which are redistributive, tax the rich, avoid budgetary conditions and don’t apply fines and termination for non-compliance. Respondents in wealthier regions, however, are more likely to support packages with fines and termination. This suggests that when forming opinions on European fiscal integration, people are likely to favour what is best for their region and take into account the pandemic’s impact.

In particular, redistributive policies have been found to elicit government support and political trust. Yet, there is limited knowledge on the effect of supranational redistribution on EU support and trust respectively. This paper analyses the feedback effects on support and trust in the EU of three types of redistributive policies at the supranational level: unemployment benefit (EUBS), social benefit (ESBS) and NextGenEU. The first two policies are at the stage of agenda setting and aim at correcting social inequalities among EU citizens irrespective of their member state of residence, while the last one is already being implemented and addresses redistribution between member states in order to tackle the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and sustainability. I employ survey experiments in Italy and Spain, two countries with similar social and economic challenges but distinct proportions of Eurosceptic citizens. The paper finds that EUBS increases trust in the EU especially in the case of individuals in situations of economic vulnerability.

The paper argues that citizens perceive such division, and that their fiscal solidarity with other EU countries is structured along a centre-periphery divide. Empirically, such a claim is investigated using Heckman-style probit modelling with sample selection for a pooled dataset of two surveys in 2020 and 2021 among citizens of 13 European countries by the European University Institute and YouGov. The results show that such a centre-periphery divide among citizens exist: Citizens in centre countries are more likely to express solidarity with other centre countries than with periphery countries, and vice versa. The findings show that citizens perceive the power hierarchy among EU member states and that there is a spatial-relational dimension to European fiscal solidarity.

We argue that the progressing trend of European institutional integration since the 1950s has made EU institutions increasingly visible and this visibility, in turn, has raised the probability that European institutions are identified as objects of blame. As a result, we expect that the more a country institutionally integrates on the European level, the more pronounced should the educational divide in EU support become. In particular, we expect that the lower educated should become increasingly skeptical of membership in the EU compared to the higher educated. Applying a Bayesian mixed-effects modeling approach that draws on 85 waves of the Eurobarometer survey in EU-15 countries covering more than 820.000 respondents between 1976 and 2014, we show that the gap between low and high educated citizens in support for EU membership widens substantially with a country’s level of European institutional integration. Beyond the European context, we believe that our findings have important implications for the growing educational divide in attitudes towards public institutions in developed democracies.

But how? Existing literature often builds on a binary conceptualization of European identity, distinguishing between EU citizens that have integrated some (not specified) form of a European identity and those who have exclusively national identities. Not surprisingly, empirical studies show that exclusive national identities correlate with preferences for more restrictive migration policies. However, this analytical set-up ignores the multidimensionality of both identity and migration policy. We use a more nuanced framework of identity, which (a) distinguishes between civic and cultural dimensions of European identity and (b) varies in how citizens evaluate their in-group vis-à-vis the out-group. By relating this conceptualization of identity to EU migration attitudes, we predict whom one prefers as a migrant coming to Europe. We present results from our survey, including a conjoint experiment, evaluating the links between respondents' European identity and their preferences regarding different types of migrants in seven European countries. The findings on how identity relates to migration attitudes have important implications for the challenges of EU migration policy.

But how? Existing literature often builds on a binary conceptualization of European identity, distinguishing between EU citizens that have integrated some (not specified) form of a European identity and those who have exclusively national identities. Not surprisingly, empirical studies show that exclusive national identities correlate with preferences for more restrictive migration policies. However, this analytical set-up ignores the multidimensionality of both identity and migration policy. We use a more nuanced framework of identity, which (a) distinguishes between civic and cultural dimensions of European identity and (b) varies in how citizens evaluate their in-group vis-à-vis the out-group. By relating this conceptualization of identity to EU migration attitudes, we predict whom one prefers as a migrant coming to Europe. We present results from our survey, including a conjoint experiment, evaluating the links between respondents' European identity and their preferences regarding different types of migrants in seven European countries. The findings on how identity relates to migration attitudes have important implications for the challenges of EU migration policy.

A Comparative Reappraisal of Individual-Level Determinants of Political Support for the EU in the Absence of a European Demos	Postfunctionalist arguments emphasizing the conflict between identity and supranational integration populate the core of contemporary scholarly debate on political support for the EU. However, evidence suggests that while identification with a European polity remains consistently low, support for EU membership is remarkably higher and in an increasing trajectory since the Great Recession; support for integration appears to exist in absence of a European demos. This arguably elicits a revisitation of extant mainstream scholarship on EU political attitudes. To do so, this paper provides a comparative assessment of the main predictors of diffuse political support for the EU, drawing on original large-N survey data collected yearly in 16 EU member-states since 2018. An embedded vignette experiment will measure the effect of security, economic and cultural frames of EU integration on EU political support. Firstly, I find that attitudes towards the EU are more strongly predicted by utilitarian expectations of economic prosperity derived from EU membership than by identity or national security concerns. Secondly, I ascertain that positive economic frames generate the strongest effect in political support for the EU.

We employ a novel approach to unearthing evidence of a common European public by investigating the common dynamic properties of public opinion across six EU member states. Specifically, we use a Bayesian State-Space model to estimate a common component in public opinion related to EU politics and EU integration, over seven decades. The results indicate that changes in public opinion do not exclusively reflect national dynamics –we find evidence of a common European factor that underlies changes in public opinion about the EU, providing the first evidence ever for a transnational opinion cycle. However, the common factor only emerged over time. While country-specific factors were dominant in shaping fluctuations in public opinion before the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, a common European component became dominant in the period after. We further find that co-movement in public opinion about Europe has historically been strongest in Italy and France, while Danish public’s opinion dynamics have run counter to those of fellow member states.

Our results suggest that respondents' institutional reform preferences are conditional on their getting their favoured policy outcomes.

Understanding Integration Processes In Migration And Energy After The Invasion Of Ukraine	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has reinvigorated interest in theories of European integration. Most early accounts highlight alignment and coordination without institutional integration. Below the surface, however, the war sparked temporal inversions of member states’ attitudes towards integration of refugee and energy policy, which highlight underappreciated integration mechanisms. In migration, we have seen the rapid and uncontroversial activation of the Temporary Protection Directive, a supranational instrument that, while pre-existing, had been widely considered dead letter. The supranational but flexible solution offered by the Directive enabled a rapid response and practical solidarity rather than presenting a stumbling block, unlike in previous refugee crises. In energy policy, a temporal inversion of positions is opening a window of opportunity in a field previously marked by deadlock. However, changes in both areas were seemingly not driven by regularly identified integration mechanisms (increased solidarity or issue linkage to overcome disagreement). Tracing EU-level negotiations and the evolving preferences of key member states, this paper argues that, next to efficiency gains and exogenous security threats, time-inconsistencies and credible commitments are crucial to explain these developments.

The answers of the EU implementation literature to this question are quite mixed. We argue that those inconclusive findings are not only due to varying methodological choices and different data foundations, but also result from a rather narrow conceptual understanding of complexity. In this study, we make the case that the complexity of a directive is not only determined by its scope, as existing research suggests, but also results from how the directive is formulated (linguistic complexity) and how interdependent its legal provisions are (relational complexity). The core question we address in this study is whether different types of complexity have different effects on implementation performance in the EU member states. Empirically, we combine several data sources to evaluate the impact of directive complexity on transposition delays and infringement proceedings, following the adoption of roughly 1,000 EU directives between 1993 and 2021. The analysis yields new insights into how complexity-induced costs of compliance affect the performance of EU member states at the implementation stage.

Why did people on the Left oppose, and Right support, European Integration in the 1980s, but this pattern reverse in the 2020s? In contrast to the common account of European Integration as a new ‘cleavage’ in European politics, on a par with class, religion, and geography, we argue that citizens evaluate European Integration by what it has on offer for them. If Europe offers them a policy-bundle in line with their own (left-right) preferences, they support it. If not, they are opposed. In turn, the EU adjusts its policy-mix in response to what the EU expects the public demands. Although sometimes out of tune, support for European Integration is a dance between the public self-interested assessment of Europe’s policy-mix supply and Europe’s responsiveness to the public’s policy-mix demand. We test this theory using individual-level public opinion data from all EU member states since the mid 1970s and a novel method for measuring the left-right policy location of EU legislative outputs over time.

Given the increasing rivalry with China, the uncertain transatlantic relationship, Russia’s irredentism, and European citizens’ scepticism of globalization, European political leaders have increasingly engaged in a discourse centred on sovereignty, autonomy, and protection. Our paper investigates how and for which reasons leaders have accommodated the tension between the universalism of the LIO and the particularism of the 'sovereign territorial order' (STO). We argue that the European political space, where boundaries can be erected on either the national or the supranational level, enables two further mixed understandings of international order, namely 'national liberalism' and 'supranational sovereigntism'. Methodologically, we use latent semantic scaling (Watanabe 2021) and apply it to the EUSpeech corpus (Schumacher et al. 2020) to classify speeches along the two dimensions of universal versus particularistic values, and supranational versus national authority. Our paper contributes to studies on the rebordering of European integration and the crisis of the LIO.

The resulting Europeanization à la carte has led to citizens having different perceptions as to how important a certain policy domain is for the relationships between European countries. Despite this distinction made by the public, only few studies investigated issue importance of European integration across policy domains and even less the underlying reasons. In this paper, we argue that public’s assigned relevance of integration in specific policy domains is influenced by characteristics of these domains. First, functional pressures of scale drive issue importance of EU integration with the hope that respective policy areas might be more effectively and efficiently realized when integrated. Second, political parties’ preferences to address certain issues indicates to which degree citizens give importance to this issue for EU integration. Empirically, we analyze public’s assigned importance to six policy domains for future integration between the EU and its neighboring European non-members. For this, we collected survey data in eight EU and non-EU countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) in 2021.

How do governments respond to these trends? We show that governments can restrict entry into the real estate market, and we uncover the political incentives for citizens to demand and governments to impose these restrictions. We argue that citizens demand restrictions to maintain affordable housing, especially where housing prices have increased the most, as a strategy to secure their retirement savings, and when they lack access to family support for real estate purchases. We further argue that democratic governments, who are more responsive to citizen demands, are more likely to impose these restrictions, while countries with many constraints on executive actions are less likely to impose them. To evaluate our theoretical propositions, we present a new database documenting restrictions on the transactions of non-residents over time and across countries. We also draw on a survey experiment that analyzes the support for these measures on non-resident real estate ownership to corroborate our argument.

Consequently, MDBs need to deal with various negative implications of the pandemic, such as resource cuts and scenarios of increased forum shopping for cheap crisis-response capital. In other cases, MDBs benefit from crises and seize the opportunity to expand their scope, policy instruments and/or introduce structural reforms. Consequently, when and how MDBs use crisis as an opportunity to adapt, reform, and/or expand their scope of operations. Furthermore, how IOs respond to different global crises, and what are the factors that determine whether they can transform these into real opportunities for growth and reform. I argue that in times of crisis, variation in MDBs’ institutional design affects their ability to expand their scope of operations and initiate reforms. To test this hypothesis, I conduct a focused, structured comparison of twelve MDBs, since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020 and examine their policy responses in the first two years of the pandemic.

Designed for temporary stays in multinational companies or as contractual service suppliers, and usually retaining the work contract in the country of origin, business mobility eludes ordinary immigration statistics and public attention. Using a combination of original survey and administrative data we start by describing the volume, characteristics and evolution of business mobility as compared to other forms of third country labor migration in the last decade. After establishing its quantitative importance, we explore the regulations facilitating this “back-door” migration in domestic and international law. We show that contrary to the otherwise restrictive provisions for the entry of third country nationals in Switzerland, business migrants benefit from numerous facilitations in national law and under preferential trade agreements. The last part of the paper therefore examines the effects of these regulatory facilitations on migration flows using econometric analysis.

This paper explores one such form of “back-door” migration: business mobility in Switzerland. Designed for temporary stays in multinational companies or as contractual service suppliers, and usually retaining the work contract in the country of origin, business mobility eludes ordinary immigration statistics and public attention. Using a combination of original survey and administrative data we start by describing the volume, characteristics and evolution of business mobility as compared to other forms of third country labor migration in the last decade. After establishing its quantitative importance, we explore the regulations facilitating this “back-door” migration in domestic and international law. We show that contrary to the otherwise restrictive provisions for the entry of third country nationals in Switzerland, business migrants benefit from numerous facilitations in national law and under preferential trade agreements. The last part of the paper therefore examines the effects of these regulatory facilitations on migration flows using econometric analysis.

Role Models Events, Informational Content and Women’s Political Ambition	The gender-gap in political ambition remains a constant today even though women and men are now engaging in other types of political participation at the same rates. Research suggests that seeing women running for office in the real-world might increase other women's political ambition (e.g., Wolbrecht & Campbell, 2007). This phenomenon is called Role-Model Effect. Parties and organisations interested in increasing women's political representation started recreating this effect in the artificial environment of Mentoring Events where female political actors meet women non-political actors. Research investigating the effectiveness of mentoring events produced mixed findings (Foos and Gilardi, 2020). I argue that in mentoring events, role-model effect is much more connected to what the role models say in a short amount of time compared to real-world role-model effect. I run a survey experiment to separate the effect of role models’ speeches from their “presence” in the room. I tested the effect of eight treatments based on real-life mentoring events on a representative sample of the British population. Findings have both practical and theoretical implications for the topic of women’s political ambition.

Relying on a novel dataset on Italian parliamentarians' tweets from January 2020 to February 2022, we employ network analysis to assess the shape and dynamics of inter- and intra-party networks, and we use structural topic models to compare politicians’ issue-attention across a variety of politically relevant topics. Our results show women are as well-connected and as active as men, and tweet on a wide range of topics. Furthermore, women draw attention to the sub-issues they care the most when discussing the same topics addressed by men, which signal women's intention to bring their own perspective in the political debate. Our analysis thus suggests the net is indeed a friendlier environment than more conventional political arenas, where women numeric under-representation, their appointment to more marginal positions, and gender gaps in issue attention are still detectable.

Contrary to the proponents of the modernisation theory, the global value change towards post-materialist values has been hampered by citizens’ resistance and counteractions of (right-wing) populist actors in several EU countries. Insofar research has investigated the individual-level effects and country-level differences but overlooked the EU aspect, namely the impact of specific EU gender mainstreaming policies. Previous literature on cross-country divergence in the EU has found that such factors as the religious composition and the degree of modernisation can successfully explain this internal divergence. Proponents of the neo-institutionalist approach have also analysed the effect of EU policymaking, although only a few studies successfully quantify this parameter. Using data from the most recent round of the European Values Survey, this paper investigates the effects of EU policymaking on gender equality attitudes in the EU. The multi-level analysis provides empirical evidence on the causal mechanisms of European efforts on citizens’ attitudes.

The lack of candidate diversity and descriptive under-representation of groups such as ethnic minorities, females, young or working class people in parliaments is a common issue in public and scholarly debate. However, existing studies on whether this makes people more likely to vote for candidates that increase their own group's representation in parliament yield mixed results. Examining voters usage of group cues in the German parliament election in 2021, we provide new evidence against this mechanism. Specifically, we collected data on all candidates' group characteristics to match those with group memberships of survey respondents. We found that age, gender and occupational cues do not significantly alter voting decisions in the candidate vote. This indicates voters' concerns about diversity in parliaments and a lack of their in-group's representation is only secondary to issue or ideological voting.

This has led to the politicization of gender issues. However, little is known about the extent to which these issues divide European societies. This is surprising, since a growing body of literature focuses on the levels of issue polarization. To address this gap, this study employs a unique approach to measuring levels of support and opposition for gender equality, and the extent to which this issue polarizes affectively. Using original survey data collected in ten European countries in autumn 2022, this paper maps the division around the issue across Europe and analyzes how different stances on state measures for more gender equality relate to voting behavior. This study adds to the literature by providing a theoretical link between polarization and gender equality and by introducing a new approach to measure polarization of issues. The empirical findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between gender equality, politicization, and polarization in Europe.

Using general population telephone surveys and targeted online surveys as well as priming experiments, the studies presented here look at the extent to which liberal socio-political views among young people are driven by non-traditional gender identities. The implication explored here is that young people who assert very traditional masculine or feminine gender identities are not more likely to be liberal, and are finding new ways to use political and social activities to express their gender identities. This includes traits like sexism and vote choice, but also activities, like buying an owning cryptocurrency, that are strongly linked to political attitudes among young men.

We know that men are more likely to cast their vote for a populist radical right party compared to women. However, most studies actually analyze the impact of the biological sex of the voters and do not take their gender into account. The effect of both sex and gender, as two distinct concepts, so far is understudied. To shed light on the impact of sex and gender identity on voting for the populist radical right, this study utilizes an original survey among 2,764 voters conducted in the context of the general election 2021 in Germany. The findings demonstrate that both sex and gender identity affect populist radical right voting. Women are less likely to vote for the radical right compared to men. Additionally, voters that strongly identify with male traits are more likely to vote for the radical right.

How does women’s political inclusion alter the nature of political organization? In 2004, women in India’s state of Bihar were 12% points less likely to vote than men, but by 2019 they voted 5% points more than men. Are these women mobilized into the same patriarchal, clientelist and caste-based systems that mobilize men? Or does their political inclusion reshape relationships of political exchange and generate more programmatic politics? We use data from a novel census in 12 villages in Bihar to map political networks and the nature of gendered political mobilization. We find rural Indian political networks are segregated by gender and women have less access to male-dominated clientelist networks, but, conditional on access, also engage less in such relationships. While many women are passively mobilized by men in their households to amplify household voting power, women who do find their way into politics must do so via collective action to articulate programmatic demands. These results elucidate the strategic incentives to suppress women’s political participation and demonstrate how women’s political exclusion is built on clientelist systems.

Assessing information-seeking about female politicians	What citizens know and learn about female politicians is crucial for the success of women in politics: Information mediates whether citizens judge candidates on their characteristics or use stereotypes in their assessment, often relying on candidate gender as a heuristic. However, it is unclear how citizens acquire such information. Addressing this, I differentiate gendered information availability and gendered patterns of information-seeking. I argue that due to the incongruence of leadership and gender stereotypes, citizens seek more information about female politicians. However, this information-seeking occurs along stereotypical lines. As a result, it may reinforce existing stereotypes about women in politics. I test this argument based on digital trace data from Wikipedia covering 1500 legislators over two years. Drawing on page views as well as users’ click-paths, I show that Wikipedia users search for more information on female politicians, however, their interest is centered on family and personal life, rather than policy positions. Thereby, the paper presents a novel approach to the study of perceptions of politicians that allows cross-national and over-time comparisons of political information-seeking at a low cost.

Previous studies suggest that women take on the vast majority of such mental work. We theorize that because this often invisible form of unpaid labor is constantly on women’s, but not men’s, minds, priming the mental load will have distinct influences on men versus women. We expect that men asked to think about their cognitive household “to do” list will subsequently express less interest in political participation and workplace advancement. However, because women already factor the mental load into decisions about whether and how to participate in public life, we posit that women will show no significant change in their political and workplace preferences as a result of this priming. We test this argument with a preregistered survey experiment in the United States manipulating the salience of cognitive household labor tasks. Our results offer new insights on the relevance of household-based inequalities to gender equality in public life.

By relating the aspect of political visibility to an understanding of gender that allocates women in the private sphere, we theorize that internal attitudinal and external behavioral measures of conservative views on gender norms help explain this gap. To this end, we analyze the impact of individual’s attitudes towards women’s visibility in the public sphere as well as their observations of and experiences with hateful speech on the internet.

Recent research increasingly shows, however, that this effect is frequently exaggerated and limited to the minority of young volunteers raised in politically disengaged households and otherwise unlikely to be socialised into being politically active. This research brings in gender - as an institution that structures political socialisation - and considers whether and how it moderates the effect of volunteering on the political engagement and behaviour of young people. The analysis shows that the positive effects of volunteering are limited almost entirely to young men, which is argued to reflect the impact of the gendered nature of political socialisation on the type of volunteer activity typically engaged in by young men and women. The paper argues that while volunteering can reduce socio-economic inequalities in first-time voter turnout, this is only the case for men.

Sports teams are not explicitly political organizations; yet they promote strong group consciousness. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, football stadiums are often the setting of racist and sexist altercations. But can initiatives led by a sport’s team change this? Through a partnership with Bahia Football Club, we employ two survey experiments (N = 1,804 and N = 2,189) to explore whether the Club’s anti-racism and anti-sexism initiatives have an impact on their fans’ attitudes towards Afro-Brazilians and women. We find that the Club’s anti-racism initiatives are well-evaluated by fans but have null effects on their attitudes; meanwhile, the anti-sexism initiatives seeking to make football more welcoming to women backfire: the initiative not only prompts respondents to display more sexist attitudes, but also to more negatively evaluate the Club and its efforts to promote equality and inclusion in other areas.

Females’ gains in education and governments’ affirmative actions were the main driver towards more gender equality. More recently, political actors, often but not only from right-wing populist parties, claim that governments’ action to foster equality between the sexes have gone too far or should at least be ended – because there is no longer any inequality between men and women. Substantial parts of Western populations agree with this. Using survey data from four online surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022 as part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we examine who favours and who opposes state action in favour of gender equality. We argue that a right-wing political ideology and the social threat that comes along with the perception that governments’ affirmative action produces “winners” and “losers” are the major sources of attitudes on state anti-inequality measures and examine how these rival explanations interact. We show that women utter the most support. While political orientation is a stronger predictor than socio-economic indicators, which is especially the case for men.

We examine both political and non-political attitudes, manipulate stereotypes about both men and women, and provide visual as well as textual stimuli. The treatments undermined stereotypes about the gender roles depicted in the counter-stereotypical exemplars. However, they failed to alter respondents' generic core beliefs about women and men and increase equitable attitudes. The results improve our understanding of how stereotypes contribute to gender and anti-LGBTQ bias.

We also assess the role of gender salience and citizens' agreement with or questioning of traditional gender stereotypes. The study has been pre-registered.

One explanation for this unprecedented increase is owed to better measures of race and ethnicity in the U.S. census. However, a complementary explanation is that some Whites may perceive it as advantageous to report an additional race or ethnicity. We test this hypothesis using economic games where White participants are randomly paired with a stranger who reported being White or Black. In the first study, participants play incentivized economic games that measure a wide range of behaviors. In the second study, we give the opportunity to one racial group (but not others) to earn additional money and we allow participants to report an additional race to be eligible for the additional earnings.

However, a complementary explanation is that some Whites may perceive it as advantageous to report an additional race or ethnicity. We test this hypothesis using economic games where White participants are randomly paired with a stranger who reported being White or Black. In the first study, participants play incentivized economic games that measure a wide range of behaviors. In the second study, we give the opportunity to one racial group (but not others) to earn additional money and we allow participants to report an additional race to be eligible for the additional earnings.

It substantially neglects natives' attitudes on traditional morality issues, such as gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights. In this paper, I study how exposure to culturally conservative outgroups, such as Muslim immigrants, affects progressive attitudes of the ingroup on traditional morality issues. Using a survey experiment, I contribute in two ways. First, I study whether """"""""self-categorization"""""""" - id est, the polarization of natives' progressive attitudes on traditional morality issues as a mechanism to reinforce ingroup-outgroup boundaries (Dancygier, 2017) - takes place even when natives' reference point is not culturally progressive. Second, I test a possible complementary mechanism - """"""""cognitive dissonance"""""""" - arguing that natives, especially left-wing and progressive natives, may overstress their progressive attitudes in the traditional morality dimension to compensate for higher negative attitudes towards immigrants and multiculturalism when exposed to Muslim immigrants. Moreover, I contribute to existing literature testing my theory also on newly emerging traditional morality issues, such as gender self-identification.

From a normative perspective, two properties of political speech are in a strained relationship: passion and content. Passionate political speech is desirable because it makes voters more likely to listen and engage with political messages. Content is desirable because democratic deliberation only works through an exchange of informed arguments. The relationship between passion and content gains tension if passionate speech comes at the cost of textual sparseness. In this study, I examine the relationship between passion and content in political speech from an empirical perspective. I computationally analyze a large body of video recordings and transcripts of parliamentary debates in the German Bundestag (2011—2020). I use video recordings to measure passion in legislative speech and transcripts to assess speeches' textual informativeness. Preliminary findings suggest that passionate delivery does not rule out informed argumentation, nor does dry delivery guarantee textual richness. Still, passionately conducted debates are usually less complex than more formal discussions. This suggests that legislators use parliamentary debates for varying purposes and adjust their delivery accordingly.

Voters no longer vote for the same party in every election; instead, shifts in voting are becoming increasingly common. To regain lost votes, parties have incentives to respond to this volatility. However, studies taking concrete vote loss into account are scarce. From a saliency perspective, we argue that if a party loses a considerable fraction of voters to another party, it will try and win these voters back by putting more emphasis on the issues that were most salient for the competing party. To test this assumption, we focus on national parties in five European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Spain) within a multi-level regression analysis. We analyse issue salience based on tweets of the party accounts to capture short-term tactical party agendas. With a naive Bayes classifier trained on manifesto data, we use an innovative approach of topic-coding the tweets under study. Our results help better understand in how far parties are responsive to shifts in their voter base and thus how responsiveness and vote loss are connected.

Although social media only recently emerged, the accumulation of evidence undermining the ‘echo chamber’ hypothesis is striking. While self-selective exposure to congruent content - the echo chamber - is not as salient as expected, the ideological bias induced primarily by algorithmic selection - the filter bubble - has been less scrutinized. In this study, we propose a new experimental research design to investigate recommender systems. We rely on automated agents, which 'treat' the algorithm with ideological and behavioral cues. For each agent, we compare the recommended timeline and the artificially reconstructed chronological timeline to isolate the amplification bias of the recommender. We investigate two main questions : (1) how much bias is induced by the recommender system? (2) what role do implicit and explicit cues play? The experiment features 170 automated agents, active for six weeks before and after the 2020 American presidential election. We find that, after three weeks of delivering ideological cues, the average amplification bias is 5%. Implicit cues - interacting with the content- play a much more important role than explicit ones (following accounts).

However, very few studies are able to measure it in a satisfactory way. Previous work bases such classification tasks on sentiment analysis via dictionaries or machine-learning methods, assuming that divisiveness is perceived in a uniform way by everyone observing social media interactions. This project aims to improve social media output measurement using group-specific labelling of textual data. We train three different classifiers based on the coders’ partisan identity: Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. We then apply these human-classifiers to unseen tweets. Finally, we repeat the process using a pre-trained Q&A machine-learning model, and use it as a benchmark for human coders. The four coded sets of tweets are compared across time and topics. This procedure allows us to test whether human-coders use their in-group identity to evaluate (and label) public discourse, and if and how machines deviate from each partisan group.

Yet, what does it mean for second-order MPs if a first-order election occurs and vice versa? In this paper, I find an answer to this question by analyzing the online political communication of German MPs and how it was affected by federal-level, state-level and EU-level election campaigns. Theoretically, I draw from two strands of literature. On the one hand, I refer to the campaigning and electoral circle literature to show how MPs respond to approaching elections. On the other hand, I use the literature on multilevel systems focusing on the effects of the first and second-order status of legislatures. To answer the research question, I analyze the usage of emotional language, regional references and specific campaign-related content in the Twitter communication of all MPs in the German federal parliament (Bundestag), the sixteen state-level parliaments (Landtage), and the German representatives in the European Parliament between 2017 and 2021. The results shed new light on the complex interactions between MPs representing the same geographic constituents, albeit on different electoral levels.

Flawed research can be harmful both within and outside of academia. Even when published research has been retracted and refuted by the scientific community, it may continue to be a source of misinformation. The media can play an important role in drawing broader attention to research, but may also ensure that research, once retracted, ceases to feature in popular discourse. Yet, there is little evidence on whether media reporting influences the retraction process and authors' careers. Using a conditional difference-in-differences strategy, this paper shows that articles that gained popularity in the media at publication and were later retracted face heavy citation losses, while subsequent citations become more accurate. Further, authors of such papers see a permanent decline in research output. Lastly, the paper provides evidence that media can influence both the likelihood of retraction and its timing, highlighting that the media can play an important role in contributing to the integrity of the research process.

This article analyses public attitudes toward the government’s performance on Sina Weibo during the pandemic alongside an original survey experiment. Building on framing theory, this study analyzes government framing of events or policies related to Covid-19 in the face of public critics. Specifically, this study investigates two questions: does the public stance toward controversial policies or events change in response to government framing?; does the government try to deflect blame to other authorities (local or international) to maintain political trust? To answer these questions, I first use sentiment analysis and content analysis to analyze Weibo posts. Given censorship, grievances against the government will be masked. In a second stage, I therefore conduct a survey experiment to directly expose the respondents to real-world posts on Covid-19 and test their attitude change. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of government framing as well as the limitations of public social media data.

Our findings reveal that the EU issue dimension is so powerful that it shapes support of domestic leaders, and that opportunism is what lay behind Boris Johnson’s popularity.

Our video data is further enriched with a unique set of manually collected features used as controls which provide added robustness to the analysis. The research empirically contributes to the field by being the first study to methodologically study emotional arousals of judges from ECHR (i), and by combining image and audio data to predict leanings of judges in high courts (ii). The results show that visual and audio cues carry information that text-based judgments do not possess.

We then use a transformer-based topic modelling approach to identify the thematic content of each post. Combining these data together, we show that MOCs strategically attract attention and reactions to their posts on issues where the MOC has policy expertise or a personal interest in the area by amplifying the emotions associated with these posts. Our research demonstrates the value of examining emotions in policy discussions, the importance of images in political communication, and the constraints that political elites face in their activities.

Moral reframing happens when “a position an individual would not normally support is framed in a way that is consistent with that individual’s moral values” (Feinberg & Willer, 2019, p. 1). But to what degree do politicians morally reframe, and which issues do they reframed the most? The present study, which is based on Moral Foundations Theory, investigates moral reframing efforts during U.S. presidential debates over the last two decades to understand how candidates can expand their appeal by talking about issues in ways that sway those who are not their core supporters. Currently, little is known about how much candidates reframe each issue discussed during debates or what their reframing looks like. To find out, debate transcripts are examined quantitatively with a computational content analysis using the extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (Hopp et al., 2020). Finding show how moral reframing varies by candidate, political party, issue, and incumbent vs. challenger status.

Feelings of collective victimhood have been demonstrated to have a strong effect on intergroup bias, outgroup hostility and support for violence. However, little attention has been paid to the use of these narratives by political elites within the context of electoral politics. Along with a descriptive analysis of victimhood narratives in congress, I argue that political elites will utilize these narratives to build support and direct attacks against their political opposition. To test this theory, I will leverage the 7 year time gap between the introduction of C-SPAN to both chambers of Congress for a difference-in-differences design. If these narratives are used instrumentally an increase in the reach of congressional speeches would incentivize more frequent use. To measure the use of victimhood narratives I will build a novel machine-learning classifier to predict the presence of these narratives in speeches parsed from the congressional record. This will provide valuable insight into the use of potentially dangerous or polarizing narratives by political elites.

This study aims to disentangle this by identifying message features that may contribute to propaganda dissemination over these online platforms. Drawing from dual-process model scholarship, this research examines how the design of such political content activates heuristic rather than systematic information processing, thus affecting recipients’ evaluations over content validity and shareability. Using data from an online between-subject Discrete Choice Experiment (n = 333), this study assesses the impact of six different informational cues – source, endorsement, popularity, emotional salience, moral valence, and stereotyping – on the likelihood that political messages would be considered valid and shareable on social media. Results demonstrate that all these heuristic-based cues affect the evaluation process, but not always as expected. For instance, stereotypes and endorsements from institutional accounts tend to reduce validity and shareability levels, while endorsements from public figures, such as celebrities or influencers, increase them.

Is there a trade-off between campaigning on identity versus pocket-book issues? This paper assesses the theory that economic issues resonate with the public more when they are tied to cultural and social cleavages and concerns. Using a corpus of approximately 450,000 Congressional Facebook posts, this paper tests whether left-leaning politicians pay greater attention to poverty, labor market issues and fairness, whereas right-leaning politicians stress international competition. Evidence suggests that elites frame various aspects of the economy as valence issues, but sometimes also rhetorically weaponize certain economic topics. Moreover, the observed behavior is consistent with pandering, whereby legislators are rewarded with engagement for their more extreme rhetoric.

I relate German parliamentary debates to media coverage on digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications, to analyse to what extent media reporting influences the agenda and framing on digitalisation supported by policymakers, and who dominates the agenda. As for media coverage, I rely on samples of newspaper articles and transcripts of news broadcasting programmes in German public TV. I use hierarchical topic models to compare how similar or different the contexts are, in which digitalisation is talked about in the media and in parliament. I combine this comparative approach with a network analysis, where I model the flow of information between policymakers and the media, by identifying when political parties or individual politicians are mentioned in articles related to digitalisation. This approach helps us understand how close or distant policymakers are to one another in their agenda on digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications, and how certain topics and information spread over time.

While the site has not started to publish hard propaganda with the new editorial team, strong doubts remained as to whether it remained independent. I hypothesize that after the change they are using sophisticated forms of information manipulation. Reporting less bad news (censorship) and framing the government as a competent actor by attributing positive events to them while blaming external actors for the negative event (selective attribution) are two possible ways to implement less visible news manipulation. With a corpus of COVID-19-related news - a salient topic both before and after the editorial change - from index.hu and from four further news sites I aim to document the shift in the news coverage. News fragments with relevant governmental or external actors are selected and rated with human coders and with a supervised learning algorithm. The direction change will be analyzed with the synthetic difference-in-differences method.

Research on the media’s influence finds that the news can have chilling effects on elections, that its reporting on corruption leads to electoral consequences, and that audiences are sensitive to the media’s tone. In contrast, there is an established literature on the use of public programs to influence voters. I combine both literatures to explore the use of incumbent’s publicity budgets to influence media coverage of elections. First, I identify competitive districts where publicity spending is targeted, second, I use NLP to measure the sentiment of local newspapers’ reporting prior to the election, and third I use a regression discontinuity design to measure the effect of article sentiment on district level results. The case study is Mexico’s 2015 congressional elections, where the incumbent president managed a million-dollar publicity budget and where media often rely on government spending to operate. The findings suggest that incumbents can tip the scale with targeted advertisements that not only promote their agenda, but also alters how newspapers write about them.

Climate change is widely perceived as the most significant challenge of this century. We argue the more citizens are concerned about the effects of climate change and unsatisfied with their government's climate politics, the greater their dissatisfaction with democracy and propensity to hold anti-elitist views. We draw on two German panel data sets to address these understudied relationships. First, we examine the main relationship between being worried about climate change and satisfaction with democracy as it exists in Germany using data from three waves (2010, 2016, 2020) of the Socio-Economic Panel. We reproduce this analysis with data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) Panel, ranging from 2017 to 2022. Further, using three GLES waves, we study how satisfaction with the government's climate action affects general satisfaction with democracy. Finally, we investigate the association between prioritizing climate action and multiple dimensions of populism, focusing on anti-elitism. Against the backdrop of exacerbating climate change, our research contributes to understanding how worries about climate change and dissatisfaction with political action might translate into disenchantment with the democratic system itself.

One reason high-income countries outsource environmental degradation might be that environmental issues abroad are less salient in the political process than environmental quality at home. To assess this salience gap, I examine differences between parties and members of parliament in portraying global compared to local environmental issues in parliamentary speeches. To this end, I analyze parliamentary speeches between 1990 and 2018 from the British House of Commons and the German Bundestag. The results indicate that environmental issues in foreign countries are addressed more frequently by left-wing parties and by less experienced members of parliament. Additionally, the results suggest that in two-party and multi-party systems, primarily small parties play a leading role in setting the agenda for environmental issues abroad.

Scientists and most politicians agree that a “net zero future” is required to limit the impact of climate change. Yet, we know little about policymakers’ awareness of and focus on specific climate-friendly innovations. We study this question by focusing on Ireland, a country that announced goals to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. We first retrieve all academic publications on the energy transition involving researchers working at Irish universities. Afterwards, we train and validate transformer-based machine learning classifiers to identify these innovations in legislative speeches delivered between 2009 and 2022. After mapping the prevalence of scientific solutions in the political discourse, we investigate whether the Paris Agreement in 2016 changed the salience of scientific solutions for tackling climate change. Finally, we assess whether legislators’ backgrounds and constituency characteristics predict the focus on specific solutions. These findings contribute to our understanding of politicians’ awareness and support of recent innovations required to achieve carbon neutrality.

They contend that politicians’ international pledges are cheap talk with little bearing on domestic action. Building on an original conceptual and empirical framework we hypothesize that countries more reliant on carbon intensive industries see these issues related to their pledges become more salient in elite debates, and their positions on these issues more polarized; in contrast, in countries with greater use of renewables expect to see increased salience in elite debates without increased disagreement. We test these expectations in 16 European-countries, 2009-2019, with the ParlEE dataset, which is based on a supervised machine learning classification of issues and positions over time. Consistent with a more optimistic perspective that international pledges are not cheap talk, our analysis indicates a clear shift in the salience and position of national parties following the announcement of the 2015 Paris Agreement. These results hold implications for studies linking international agreements to domestic politics and the consequences thereof for national decision-making as well as for domestic political studies of party and governmental position-taking.

In March 2022, the European Commission adopted the Taxonomy Delegated Act, committing to a policy classifying this type of energy production as sustainable. With support for nuclear energy on the rise and ongoing challenges to energy security in Europe, how can the timing of this substantive policy change be explained? Our new survey data uncover increased public scepticisim in Germany around nuclear energy phase-out and disposal leading up to the EC decision. Policy change might therefore be conceived as a response to variation in public opinion. However, by relying on insights from the field of energy policy and others, I show that nuclear energy is by no means a sustainable energy source. Rather, this is an instance of misplaced procedural responsiveness, where the EC uses the window of public opinion change to cater to particularistic national interests. This paper helps to understand the causal mechanisms driving policy development by linking responsiveness to public opinion with a substantive discussion of the policy issue. It underscores how misplaced institutional responsiveness can legitimize environmentally dangerous policies under the cloak of climate change.

This article presents the first comparative study of IO politicization spanning considerable temporal, geographic, and IO variation. We track the salience of 75 IOs in six legislatures between 1991 and 2018 and provide the most complete evidence to date for the existence of an authority-politicization nexus in international politics. Crucially, we also show which type of authority matters most for the politicization of IOs. We find that find that increases in delegated authority have a larger effect on IO politicization than increases in pooled authority (delegated authority hypothesis) and that general purpose IOs are more likely to be politicized than task specific IOs (contract hypothesis).

The Importance of the Data-Generating Process for Analyzing Legislative Text Data	With the progressing advances in text analysis methods and the increasing accessibility of parliamentary documents, the range of available tools for legislative scholars has increased massively over the past years. While the potential for comparative studies is huge, researchers can easily overlook the pitfalls associated with analyzing these documents. Against this background, the aim of this project is twofold. First, I asses on a theoretical level how seemingly identical legislative instruments may vary in different countries. I show that a clear definition of concepts such as speech or bill and the attention to and description of the data-generating process are key to avoid comparing apples with oranges. In the second part, I show what implications these distinctions can have for comparative analyses. Applying common text-as-data methods to a new corpus combining legislative speech data with bill and law documents, I show in three examples how these analyses come to different results depending on the underlying conceptualization of the object of study.

Speaking ahead of final voting in plenary sessions, MPs in parliamentary systems craft speeches primarily to defend their party’s decision to vote in favour or against an issue to the public and other parties. Occasionally, the goal of a speech will be a defense of a personal vote and, in rare instances, to persuade wavering colleagues from their own or other parties. To achieve effective communication, a speech should be clear and comprehensible. However, MPs have different styles of speaking due to rhetorical talent, education, habits, training and actual practice. Recent studies have focused on aspects of parliamentary speech-making such as issue choice or sentiment. We do not know much yet about speaking styles. This paper studies parliamentary speeches in the Austrian Nationalrat (1996-2021). We apply a text-as-data approach to detect speaking styles in parliament and use the type of debate and MPs characteristics (education, seniority, specialization, frequency of speaking) to identify factors that influence the way MPs speak, thereby increasing our understanding of legislative debates.

For this, we apply a machine learning model for computationally assessing the logical strength in parliamentary debates in the UK and Germany from the 1990s to 2018 based on the ParlSpeech v2 Corpus. We hypothesize that government and opposition parties differ in their argumentation quality due to differing “necessities” because government parties are both responsible and accountable, and thus are forced to stick to more factual and cogent expressions. Similarly, we hypothesize that mainstream parties differ from more extreme parties at both ends of the left-right spectrum as they need to appear more “rational” in order to appeal to a larger electorate.

These studies aim to understand how political or demographic factors such as mandate type or gender are related to the frequency with which legislators participate on the parliamentary floor. The dominant methodological approach to analyzing debate participation is centered around regression models where the number of speeches per legislator during one legislative term gets regressed on key variables of interest and a set of control variables. I argue that such models produce biased results because they fail to take procedural rules into account. I formalize the argument and derive the exact analytical form of the bias. Next, I develop clear model-building guidelines for researchers interested in comparing speech counts by legislators of different groups and demonstrate the relevance of my approach with empirical data. I conclude by discussing broader implications. The identified issue is not limited to the analysis of parliamentary speech counts alone but complicates the analysis of portfolio allocations or committee assignments in a similar way.

Examining the Existence of a Transnational Cleavage in Europe.	Transnational, integration-demarcation, EU integration, or globalisation-nationalism. This proposed new cleavage has many names, but both its content and existence are contested. For some, EU integration is a cleavage dividing society into two groups: those who benefit and those who lose out from the economic integration and freedom of movement entailed by integration. However, others conceptualise EU integration and globalisation as critical junctures that alter the class cleavage and heighten competitions over immigration. In this paper, we examine whether there is a transnational cleavage. An observable implication of the existence of an EU-related cleavage is that parties will attempt to appeal to either the the winners or losers of EU integration by combining both dimensions. In contrast, if European integration alters existing cleavages, then parties' positions on EU integration will be structured by either the class cleavage or the immigration divide, depending on the context. Analysing party competition across EU Member States using CHES data, we find no transnational cleavage, even though demands on parties to be ideological coherent should enhance such a cleavage’s visibility, compared to examining voters.

Scholars increasingly characterize party competition as multidimensional. However, there are important differences between countries in the extent to which new fault lines cross-cut existing ideological oppositions. It has been argued that such differences are important, because the cross-cuttingness of parties’ positions on different ideological dimensions determines the clarity of parties’ brands and in this way shapes party attachments. Most of what we know about the connection between parties’ position, brand clarity and partisanship relies on expert- or manifesto-based estimates of party positions, forcing scholars to assume that voters are perfectly informed about parties’ positions on multiple dimensions. To address this limitation, we rely on an original data collection of surveys in 11 countries in which we asked respondents to position parties on six different issues, capturing economic, social, and cultural divisions. Our design allows connecting citizens’ perceptions of the space of party competition in their country to views about the clarity of parties’ ideological brands and measures of partisanship. We provide unique individual-level insights into the ways in which party positions and the restructuring of party competition shape party attachments.

We take advantage of a vast system of ad-hoc commissions that the Swedish ministers have developed over time as part of the more general public bureaucracy, covering more than 70,000 unique appointments between 1971 and 2021. We find that, while the ministers generally oversample appointees from their own partisan ranks, the overall distribution of political appointees also tends to reflect the prevailing balance of power in the parliament.

Focusing on Supreme Court nominations, we present data on all recurrent activist groups between 1930-2020, examining the changing organizational ecology of appointment politics. We then formulate a game-theoretic model of group leaders’ decisions to enter a political domain, and citizens’ decisions to join entering groups. The theory identifies demand side factors, supply side factors, and strategic factors in entry. To empirically study group decisions to enter or not enter, we examine the universe of frequent Supreme Court amici from 1953-2013. We measure relevant demand, supply, and strategic variables, including new data on amici and social movements, interest in court policy by amici, and crowding in ideological niches. Then, we statistically model individual-level decisions by the groups to durably enter appointments activism. The statistical models uncover robust empirical patterns suggested by the theory.

Focusing on Supreme Court nominations, we present data on all recurrent activist groups between 1930-2020, examining the changing organizational ecology of appointment politics. We then formulate a game-theoretic model of group leaders’ decisions to enter a political domain, and citizens’ decisions to join entering groups. The theory identifies demand side factors, supply side factors, and strategic factors in entry. To empirically study group decisions to enter or not enter, we examine the universe of frequent Supreme Court amici from 1953-2013. We measure relevant demand, supply, and strategic variables, including new data on amici and social movements, interest in court policy by amici, and crowding in ideological niches. Then, we statistically model individual-level decisions by the groups to durably enter appointments activism. The statistical models uncover robust empirical patterns suggested by the theory.

In mixed-member electoral systems (MMES), a system of representation has developed which gives expression to the proportional representation of election results. Moreover, direct election of MPs ensures constituency representation in parliament. With regard to directly elected MPs, various studies show that parliamentary voting behaviour differs from that of MPs elected via party lists. However, it is not yet known whether directly elected MPs are more responsive to policy-specific political desires of their constituencies. We test this in the German MMES before the 2017 federal election by comparing the issue priorities of voters using GLES data with the issues that their elected representatives highlight and emphasise on social media. We use a biterm topic model to identify 5 central issues mentioned by voters in >1,000,000 posts written by MP's. Our results show that directly elected representatives are more responsive to their constituencies than party-list elected representatives. The direct accountability of directly elected MPs to the electorate thus has a clear impact on the substantive representation of citizens.

Scholarship illustrates that the strategic behaviour of mainstream parties (MP) influences the election results of the radical right (RR). This paper complements respective studies by analysing the strategy that MP adopt. The choice of MP is considered in the context of the RR’s policy stance. Examining the positional distance vis-à-vis the RR, this paper addresses factors that influence the strategic positioning of MP on immigration. An investigation of the competing policy proposals is worthwhile, as the extent of topical convergence is linked to electoral performance and changes of immigration laws. Relying on the Immigration in Party Manifestos (IPM) dataset, the analyses cover 11 West European countries from 1985 to 2015. Due to IPM’s profound coverage of the immigration stance, the dataset allows to examine party competition on prominent sub-areas like immigration control. Preliminary results indicate that MP are not oriented towards the RR alone. Instead, MP also consider the positioning vis-à-vis their main competitor.

In representative democracy, substantive representation is supposed to be achieved by the party system.

Beyond this, government does not directly pick up citizens’ issue priorities. This supports the transmission belt perspective of the party system.

These studies, however, predominantly treat group appeals as a strategic tool to maximize votes, resulting in a narrow understanding of this phenomenon. In this paper we propose to address this drawback by approaching group appeals from the perspective of the representative claim theory, wherein group appeals are viewed as the first step in the process of political representation—the claim-making—and election campaigns are the venue where the claim-making takes place. This approach allows us to better evaluate how parties go about forging connections with voters based on social group identity detached from policy, revealing the significance of intangible aspects of belonging, recognition, and the expression of shared identity to the way political parties connect with voters.

Introducing and implementing a life-course approach to the study of class representation	Social scientists and the public agree that it matters who political decision-makers are. Yet, while the representation of some groups (e.g., women and ethnic minorities) has attracted a lot of scholarly attention, the representation of social classes has been studied much less. The scant evidence that exists points to a severe underrepresentation of working-class voters, yet this research is beset by a key conceptual problem: People move between classes during their life course (much more so than between genders and ethnic groups). Therefore, conceptualizing the representation of different social classes becomes theoretically and empirically highly demanding. We address this challenge first, by theorizing the implications of a dynamic understanding of class over the life-course, and second, by collecting highly granular data on the class origins and occupational trajectories of several thousand ministers in post-war European democracies. We are therefore able to present the most conceptually advanced and empirically comprehensive account to date of the representation of social classes in European governments since 1945.

How does the caretaker status of a government affect party political dynamics in parliament during a large crisis? Generally, caretaker governments are not mandated to introduce important policy changes until a new and fully-mandated government is installed. Yet major crises can demand decisive political action. This paper aims to understand the consequences of the caretaker status of the Rutte III government in the Netherlands (after its resignation in January 2021) for government-opposition dynamics during the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. We therefore draw on a qualitative text analysis of a dozen parliamentary debates. Surprisingly, we find that differences between mandated and caretaker status (before and after elections) have little effect on parliamentary dynamics. The caretaker status has only been a political issue for a minor part of the opposition parties. There is some evidence for a divergence between (former) coalition partners, but only after the elections. As such, this case provides unique insights about the functioning of caretaker conventions during crises which offers opportunities for new theorizing in the under-theorized field on caretaker cabinets.

An analysis on how virtual proceeding affected the content and influence of legislative speeches	During the COVID pandemic, virtual proceedings have been adopted by parliaments across the world as a temporary measure to meet the challenges that comes with lockdown and social distancing. However, virtual proceeding in parliaments could be beneficial beyond mere mitigation during the pandemic and it has been suggested by both scholars and practitioners that they could play a role in parliamentary procedure in the long run. This paper seeks to better understand how virtual proceedings affect the deliberative process in legislative debates. By analysing the content of contribution made by British MPs via teleconferencing software during the pandemic and contrasting them with contributions made by their colleagues in the House of Commons chamber during hybrid sessions, this paper seeks to understand whether virtual proceedings affect the emotion expressed as well as whether participating virtually adversely affect the influence of individual legislators during parliamentary debates.

The containment of the pandemic required full attention and severely influenced policy-making and party competition. However, the longer the crisis lasted, the more negative public opinion towards government measures turned. In such circumstances, it can be beneficial for political parties to send policy-signals and present themselves as credible alternatives in party competition. One possible avenue to achieve this is framing. Framing allows political actors to address different facets of a crisis, such as the protection of the health care system or particular aspects of social and economic life (e.g. labor-market policies, education). Simultaneously, the evolution of the crisis, changes in public opinion and party-level factors potentially influence framing. To analyse how parties framed the Covid-19 pandemic, I apply a text-as-data approach to press releases from Austrian parties. In conjunction with data on the number of Covid-19 infections and public opinion, I study how parties use framing to send policy-signals and engage in party competition in times of crisis.

In recent years, social media have become an essential tool for political communication. Not only does it allow politicians to address the public without the filter of traditional media, but it also allows politicians to voice opinions directly on any topic. For political parties, this presents both an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, politicians can tailor messages to their local constituents. On the other hand, parties appear disjointed and risk an electoral backlash if they do not enforce clear party stances. To understand how parties perform this balancing act, we study the communication of parties and politicians on social media in four European countries. We argue that electoral systems shape the incentives to centralize social media communication by political parties, especially during electoral campaigns. To test our hypotheses, we collected a data set of all tweets by members of parliament in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Poland between 2015 and 2022. We analyze our data using dynamic network analysis. Our results have implications for the study of intra-party politics and electoral systems.

So far we have only limited knowledge about the way female politicians use this communication. On the one hand, women politicians may simply use social media to present themselves in a likable, pleasing way e.g. by smiling a lot. In contrast, they may use the chance to present a more serious, even aggressive style as shown by a more aggressive tweeting style used by some female politicians in the US (Evans et al., 2014). This paper investigates how female politicians present themselves in social media and what influences the presentation of their emotions in pictures. We collected and analyzed more than 150'000 posts of politicians on Facebook and Instagram in Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Netherlands. We use deep learning models to detect emotion and recognize politicians' faces in images. Findings show that female politicians present themselves with more positive emotions than their male counterparts but that this is also moderated by the age and the ideology of politicians.

What Motivates Party Members to Become Active for a Political Party?	How can parties persuade party members to volunteer for the party? In recent decades, Europe's mainstream parties have struggled with declining enthusiasm and willingness to participate among their members. Whilst there are many theories on what could be done to mobilize party members, these theories have rarely been tested. We partnered with a Dutch party and ran a field experiment with over 38000 of their members---the full population---to test what motivates a party member to become active in a national campaign. We also focused on what motivates female and young party members, as the most under-represented groups in the party's membership. We test the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies---a call, an email, or an email and a call. In two studies, we randomized which party members are approached using which recruitment strategy. We measure party members' participation using a variety of outcomes such as signing up for campaign events, doing relational organizing training sessions, showing up for campaign activities, and engaging with the party on social media.

This paper explores this question from a candidate perspective. In this vein, it advances from candidate survey data to assess the perceived level of access to local media and main predictors in this regard. Specifically, we ask about the role of electoral factors such as marginality and the effective number of local parties as opposed to candidate level factors such as incumbency and candidates’ campaign strategies, i.e. whether candidates aimed to run personalized campaigns or rather not. This analysis contributes to broader debates about decentralized forms of personalized politics, where MPs and constituency candidates are assumed to take center stage vis-à-vis their parties. The paper stresses the need to better understand the role of the media in this regard and why – from the candidates’ perspective – they augment or downplay candidate saliency in campaign contexts. We draw from the German case, and the German Longitudinal Election Study in particular, as an unlikely case since it pitches personalized electoral rules against strong party organizations.

Experimental evidence on the electoral consequences of parties' reaction to protests.	Can protests affect electoral behaviour? With growing literature exploring the political consequences of protests, one key assumption is that political parties and decision-makers respond to protests out of fear of electoral repercussions. However, what voters expect of their representatives when it comes to political protests has not received much empirical scrutiny. This paper addresses this missing link between protest mobilisation, responsiveness, and voting behaviour using a survey experiment in Germany. The study explores if the occurrence of a protest can affect the electoral calculations of voters and if political behaviour is influenced by three different party strategies towards protests - accommodative, dismissive, and adversarial strategies.

Recent research has shown that opposition parties’ legislative behavior is related to their electoral outcomes. That is, opposition parties that consistently vote against government bills in parliament tend to be more electorally successful. We contribute to this literature by arguing theoretically and demonstrating empirically that parliamentary conflict between the opposition and the government increases voter turnout, in addition to the opposition parties vote shares. Specifically, we argue that when there is a clear distinction between the two sides of the aisle, voters perceive the election as more consequential and salient, and therefore are motivated to turn out to vote. We test our theory using both aggregate and individual-level analyses for 11 advanced-industrial democracies and show that turnout is higher when government-opposition relations are characterized by more conflict. Our results have important implications for parties’ and legislators’ voting behavior in parliament, party unity, and democratic accountability.

We ask respondents in Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, three European countries with varying degrees of exposure to minority governments, about their knowledge and evaluation of minority governments. Using a survey experiment, we study whether negative perceptions of minority governments are due to ignorance, misunderstandings or actual beliefs. The findings contribute to our understanding of voters’ political sophistication and have implications for research on government formation, voting theory, and public opinion.

In this paper, I argue that loyal partisans accept the changes in ideological dissonance provoked by the movement of their preferred party and diminish the dissonance caused by the movement or emergence of non-supported parties. To show this, I use two panel studies in Spain and the United Kingdom covering different scenarios in which changes in ideological dis- sonance can be quasi-exogenously manipulated: voters who remain loyal to a party that moves farther away from them, and voters who remain loyal to their party despite the emergence of a party occupying their ide- ological position. My results suggest that loyal partisans are more willing to accept high levels of ideological dissonance caused by the movement of their party than by the emergence or the movement of a non-supported party. This nuances previous studies on projection and persuasion effects: voters are not blind to ideological changes in their elected parties, nor do they uncritically follow them.

Evidence from Italy.	A normatively appealing characteristic of most representative democracies is that their electoral rules are designed to assure that each group of voters receives representation roughly proportionate to their number. Scholars have devoted a great deal of attention to malapportionment precisely because it is a violation of this principle. However, discerning the effects of malapportionment can be challenging because the intentional overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of some districts is almost always associated with characteristics of the districts that can confound the effects of the number of MPs they select. I take advantage of the design of elections to the Italian Senate between 1994 and 2001 and a comprehensive database of actions by individual MPs to disentangle the real benefits of being relatively overrepresented. I first show that due to the two-tier system one-fourth of the single-member districts end up electing two representatives instead of one. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin, I then find that districts that barely elect two representatives are more frequently the target of a wide range of legislative and non-legislative activities than districts electing one representative.

Such out-of-district support is often viewed with suspicion in a geographically centered system of representation, but it may also be a response to malapportionment and gerrymandering by allowing citizens in constituencies where their votes are not pivotal to nevertheless participate. This avenue may be particularly important for groups that are systematically underrepresented by the way districts are drawn (including urban voters and underrepresented minorities). This paper explores the implications of this explanation for out-of-state donors and campaign volunteers. Preliminary evidence suggests that out-of-state help often flows to dist ricts where the aided candidate is not particularly likely to win, but it generally flows from districts where similar efforts would be even less pivotal. Where political parties (rather than candidates) are instrumental in directing resources, they tend to be somewhat more efficiently directed.

In this paper, I find that majority bonuses—whereby the party that obtains a plurality of votes automatically secures an absolute majority in the legislature—can actually bolster the number of statistically atypical working-class candidates that manage to obtain office. I argue that this difference is mechanically driven, as workers are systematically granted lower placements on party lists under PR. Majority bonuses increase the number of seats allocated to winning parties, thereby reducing the number of parties in a given legislature. These dynamics allow a larger number of workers with low list placements to obtain a seat in legislatures. As a test of theory, I present evidence from a natural experiment on a municipality-level change in electoral law, which took place in Italy in 1993.

Over the course of the century, Zambia changed from an authoritarian colony under British rule, via an independent one-party dictatorship, to a multiparty presidential system. We outline how these regimes implied vastly different accountability structures and identify whether and how this affected both the agenda setting and the level of visible conflict within the institution. We investigate whether these changes can be attributed to changed behavior by individual MPs, or to the changed composition of the parliament. In sum, our corpus provides new leverage on questions related to legislative politics under autocratic and democratic rule.

Yet, there has been a shortfall of empirical work on when and how defections can weaken autocracies due to the lack of comparable cross-country data on elite dissent strategies. To remedy this gap, this chapter of my ongoing book manuscript examines what type of elite defections can weaken rulers' ability to stay in power. By employing the book’s dataset and panel-matching regressions, the findings suggest that defectors' success in establishing alliances with existing opposition groups will affect their capacity to become credible threats that authoritarian leaders cannot defeat through policy promises, repression, or co-optation. This association holds when elites do not coordinate their departure and even becomes stronger when defections occur closer to a national election. However, defections that result from demotions, purges, or controversial resignations tend to fall into political irrelevance. Taken together, the findings contribute to the literature on democratization, authoritarianism, and anti-regime alliances by focusing on the strains and disruptions within authoritarian governments.

We try to fill this gap by focusing on the case of Greece and the exiles instituted to remote islands by two authoritarian regimes and the democratic governments that intervened in between. Using rich archival data, we find an enduring imprint of political exiles on the ideological profile of the areas that hosted them. Delving into the mechanism driving this effect, we show that the effect is not simply due to the change in the composition of the local population or the selective migration of the local population. Instead, the evidence points to a direct pattern of cultural transmission, built around the formation of a new identity around the experience of political exile. Further analyses confirm that this identity remains vivid through both formal and informal mechanisms of collective memory.

Political parties tend to benefit electorally from charismatic politicians' popularity. However, we demonstrate theoretically that parties may also pay a cost. When they become reliant on a leader's charisma, parties grow less able to sanction their behavior in office and more prone to catering to their will---they become personalized. We show that this is particularly true in contexts of high ideological polarization and strong institutional foundations of democracy. This inversion of the power dynamic between parties and politicians provides greater room to charismatic leaders than less charismatic ones to enact anti-democratic policies. The likelihood of party illiberalization, democratic backsliding, and autocratic reversion are thus higher under charismatic leaders. We find that the associations between leaders' charisma and patterns of democratic breakdown, democratic quality, party illiberalism, and party personalization over the past several decades are consistent with our theoretical expectations.

We find that autocratization onset in election years is the result of (i) high authoritarian polarization; (ii) anti-pluralist ruling parties running elections without the presence of strong pluralist opposition; (iii) strong anti-pluralist political parties contesting against pluralist ruling parties. Our results are robust and stronger than alternative explanations, such as high levels of populism and affective polarization.

However, the source of the variation is less clear. I propose that the source of this variation relates to whether the local communities experienced repression versus recognition of their identities during communism. Specifically, I hypothesize those whose ancestors experienced repression of their identities under communism became more likely to espouse anti-communist beliefs whereas those who were recognized, showed greater likelihood to transmit socialist values. I illustrate this process in the long run with original data on ethnopolitical identity markers curated during Albania’s entire national period (1914-2023) sourced by the civil registry, cemeteries, and election data.

Access of female MPs to legislative committees in German State Legislatures	Much work has been done on the gender composition of parliaments but less is know about access and position of female MPs to/in parliamentary committees. These committees exert important policy-making powers in many parliamentary democracies. We show that access to committees is gendered, and women are less likely to become members and chairs of more important committees such as finance or economics.

Why do politicians sacrifice fiscal policy autonomy? As citizens sometimes oppose the consolidation of public finances, external constraints can become powerful tools in the hands of politicians to shift public opinion in favour of unpopular policies on their agenda. Evidence from the literature on public opinion toward climate change shows that international commitments increase citizens’ readiness to embrace costly policies. This suggests that during international negotiations policymakers can endorse international commitments that impose unpopular domestic measures. Yet, whether this logic also applies to fiscal policymaking remains understudied. To investigate whether international pledges influence domestic support for conservative fiscal policies, I carry out an original survey experiment in Italy. I measure support for a mix of tax increases and public spending cuts, presenting it as essential to comply with a new international obligation in the treatment group. Preliminary results suggest that support for fiscal consolidation increases when citizens are told that fiscal consolidation measures must be implemented to comply with an international rule.

While these studies convincingly establish an empirical association between austerity and an increase in the vote share of radical parties, the underlying mechanisms that lead to these findings remain untested. Using original data from online survey experiments fielded in four key European countries, Germany, Britain, Spain and Portugal, our paper examines the reasons behind the decision of anti-austerity voters to turn towards radical parties. We expect that voters supporting radical parties, on average, perceive mainstream (left and right) parties as indistinguishable in their macro-economic policy offers. This is particularly true when the mainstream left implemented austerity while in government. Furthermore, we expect that supporters of radical parties believe that radical parties are less likely to implement austerity than mainstream parties and if radical parties support austerity, they believe that the burden of austerity to be shifted to outgroups.

Despite the increasingly politicized nature of spatial inequalities, we still know little about its implications for redistributive preferences. We contend that when multiple jurisdictional levels exist, individuals’ preferences will be shaped by the extent to which taxing and spending at different levels will offer them a better deal. To examine this, we use data from the Cooperative Election Study (CES) matched with county-level demographic and economic data to study how differences between localities influence preferences toward taxation and spending at the state level within the United States. We find that voters are more likely to support state spending cuts when they live in counties that are richer and have higher local tax rates. In assessing the consequences of the 2008 economic downturn, we find that this gap between rich and poor places intensified after the onset of the recession. The paper demonstrates the importance of studying American politics with the analytic tools developed in the comparative political economy literature on fiscal federalism and provides new grounds as to why place matters.

Being in a position to impact the election process at multiple stages, starting from candidate registration to the vote counting during the election day, independent EMBs are critical for the fair administration of elections. Yet few studies to date have examined the process of EMBs’ formation and evaluated the impact of EMBs’ composition empirically. Using data on the composition of EMBs of different levels in Russia, with the lowest level including the commissions in over 89’000 polling stations, I show that, on the one hand, allocation of leadership positions within a commission varies systematically with the purpose of facilitating the performance of fraudulent practices. I also show that the EMBs’ composition does impact electoral outcomes in federal and regional elections and the degree of election manipulation prior to election day. This study thus speaks to the growing literature on electoral malpractice as well as research on election monitoring.

Quasi-experimental evidence from municipality elections in Poland	The existing literature has identified a number of electoral system features affecting legislative turnover. However, it has not been studied yet what is the impact of electoral reforms as such. In this paper, I study a unique series of electoral reforms in Polish municipality councils allowing to distinguish the effects of an electoral system from those of an electoral reform. I exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by a population threshold assigning municipalities to different systems. I show that incumbents elected in proportional elections struggle to adapt to majoritarian elections. However, a similar phenomenon does not occur when system changes from a proportional to a majoritarian one. This is because when districts become smaller, incumbents do not sort to avoid competition against each other. In turn, I do not find any effect of the reforms on selection into candidacy nor voters’ behaviour. The results show that electoral reforms have different impact on the success of incumbents, depending on the previously applied electoral system, and call for more attention to the one-shot consequences of reforms, in contrast with effects of electoral systems.

We know that personalist rulers in dictatorships are more likely to engage and initiate conflicts, yet we do not know if this has further implications: if conflict helps dictators to accumulate more power. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, both theoretically and empirically. I argue that dictators use conflict to increase their levels of personalism: the explanation can be found in the struggles over power of dictators vis-à-vis the elites, this is, in the domestic political environment. When dictators engage in international conflicts, they fight to personalise. Thus, international conflict is understood as a coup-proofing strategy and is a solution to the guardianship dilemma. I test the arguments by conducting a synthetic control method using novel data on personalism (which is understood as a latent dimension of autocratic rule), of a sample of dictatorships in the period 1946-2010. I find that dictators concentrate power after the onset of international wars.

Similar regimes use similar policies and internal security system to control populations. If they experience a popular mobilization, that indicates that those system do not function well. We also claim that autocrats in the same dependence network are more likely to reference political protests of regimes within the network (HA).

Elite management strategies and autocratic survival	How do autocrats reduce elite threats to their survival? Most accounts of authoritarian politics focus on the logic of power-sharing between the ruler and elite as a dominant theme using aggregate measures of institutionalization and repression. Yet, existing explanations and measures cannot capture the time-varying and more dynamic strategies that autocrats use to manage elites in their ruling coalition. We propose a theoretical distinction between horizontal and vertical autocratic elite management strategies. The former captures the reshuffling of elites to reduce their power and coordination opportunities, while maintaining the composition and size of the ruling coalition largely intact. The latter captures purges to eliminate elite members from the ruling coalition altogether, to prevent challenges. We argue that purges tend to have adverse effects by reducing an autocratic leader's survival in office, while reshuffles have the opposite effect by increasing autocrats survival in office. We test these propositions using novel measures of cabinet purges and reshuffles in autocratic cabinets between 1966 and 2020, and supplement it with studies of elite management in two representative dictatorships.

At the same time, dictators require a skilled workforce to ensure economic productivity. Autocrats can counter this dilemma through indoctrination and repression. But both strategies are costly and prone to inefficiencies. I propose a third strategy autocrats use to resolve the protest/productivity trade-off: strategic student admission. By admitting more loyal students, indoctrination becomes easier and monitoring less costly. To counter efficiency problems, however, autocrats enforce admission criteria selectively: they value loyalty signals more in fields with a higher potential of generating dissent---history, arts, or culture---and less strongly in fields less prone to critical thinking and more relevant for economic productivity---medicine, technology, or sciences. I find empirical support for this hypothesis using fine-grained, individual-level admission records from more than 500,000 university applications in the former German Democratic Republic. Results are robust to accounting for strategic applicant choices and corroborated by a natural experiment created by the regime's downfall in 1989/90. The study unpacks a key strategy of autocratic survival and has important implications for theories of democratization.

How can opposition LGs resist regime attempts to hamstring them? Opposition LGs change the strategic interaction between opposition parties and regimes because local state capacity gives opposition politicians the agency to act autonomously. Opposition LGs invest in local state capacity to reduce dependency on the regime which allows them to act in defiance of the regime from within the state. This allows opposition LGs to assert their autonomy despite the systematic and ad hoc disadvantages imposed on them, making it harder for autocrats to control political competition. I draw on interviews with local politicians and bureaucrats to analyze shifts in the strategic interaction between opposition-led LGs and the regime in Tanzania between 2005 and 2018. Using a novel dataset of taxation and transfers from 2010-2017, I show that opposition LGs invest more in local fiscal capacity and that this difference is particularly stark during crackdowns on opposition parties. I contend that this strategic investment in state capacity allows opposition parties to survive despite repeated attempts to undermine them.

However, we still know little about elites' role in democratic backsliding through this social norm perspective. This article addresses this gap by analyzing the role of political elites in shifting democratic social norms using a computational text analysis approach. Studying over 3 million tweets of elected officials in four established democracies, this article contributes to the literature by introducing the first-to-date dictionary of democratic norms at the elite level. Preliminary evidence using this approach supports a shift in elites' use of democratic norms in their direct communications, both in terms of the frequency of normative and moral democratic stances and in the type of norm categories they refer to. This paper further explores the cross-national variations of this normative shift and highlights the interaction of mainstream and challenger elites as a key factor. Overall, these findings show the important role of elites in challenging established democratic norms.

We use these data to study inequality in perceived political influence in an international perspective, bringing together measures from different opinion surveys. We compute subjective political inequality as the difference in perceptions of responsiveness between socio-economic groups. We find that this measure is remarkable consistent, with country correlation across surveys of around 0.65. At the same time, this subjective measure is unrelated to “objective” measures, such as the political inequality variable from V-Dem and measures form Lupu and Warner. We then examine micro drivers of subjective political inequality decomposing it into the contributions of different inputs of political participation, such as voting, protesting, or contacting politicians.

Moreover, executive dominance over the judiciary creates pressures for judges to adjudicate in line with executive interests.

Using class-specific MCA to compare Belgian political spaces	Decades of disconsonant electoral trends among Belgium’s two regions of Flanders and Francophone Belgium have left researchers speculating on the exact roots of their socio-political differences. Marked by discrepancies in occupational structure, political attitudes and electorally separated through the existence of two distinctive party systems, these deviations have traditionally been attributed to variations in the cleavage structures of both polities. This paper advances an innovative methodology of class-specific multiple correspondence analysis (CSA) to compare both subspaces in a single methodological approach. Substantially, after verifying that ideological dimensions are structured similarly in the two regions, I find empirical evidence suggesting the existence of two cleavages: a ‘universalism-particularism’ cleavage, which cross-cuts traditional social divisions on the basis of education, income and subnational identity; and a second, less obvious ‘economic’ cleavage. In Francophone Belgium, the universalism-particularism cleavage has not managed to structure the party system because left-wing parties kept appealing to their core working-class constituents. By contrast, the Flemish left has steered away from these voters, leaving the left-authoritarian segment of their electorate to the far-right.

However, despite mounting evidence of differences in political attitudes and behavior between cities and the countryside in several advanced democracies, a frequently overlooked aspect in this field is place-based representation along the rural-urban divide. This paper seeks to close this gap by developing and testing an analytical framework that addresses the methodological challenges involved in measuring this form of representation both in substantive and descriptive terms. Our empirical contribution is threefold. First, we use cross-national public and expert survey data to analyze the convergence between parties’ and voters’ issue positions depending on the degree of urbanization of the latter’s place of residence.

Based upon the concept of a political cleavage we contend that a cleavage is present when certain social groups share common values and attitudes and when these are mobilized by particular parties. We argue that shared social characteristics amplify potential geographic divides. If people in certain types of places are socially similar to each other and different from people in other types of places, we expect greater in-group homogeneity and larger out-group heterogeneity in issue preferences and value orientations. Such a bi-polarity based on geography and the related similarity in social characteristics fuels issue polarization and, subsequently, differences in voting behaviour. Using the last wave of the European Social Survey (ESS 2018), we apply cluster analyses and multilevel regression techniques to examine i) how place of living is linked to similarity in social attributes and ii) how this place based social similarity contributes to issue polarization and vote choice.

Providing both qualitative and quantitative evidence, this paper demonstrates that partisan districting can be an effective strategy to protect incumbent parties’ dominant political position. In addition, it shows how insurgent parties push for the adoption of PR to end the practice of partisan districting. Finally, it demonstrates that incumbents – in the face of increasing electoral threats – cling to the existing majoritarian system if partisan districting allows them to influence vote-seat distortions in their favor. Together, these findings suggest that the possibility to contain insurgent parties by means of partisan districting is an important but overlooked alternative to the adoption of PR. Moreover, by demonstrating that vote-seat distortions moderate the relationship between district-level electoral threats and legislators’ support for PR adoption, this paper offers an important corrective to Stein Rokkan’s influential electoral threat thesis

Both centre-periphery and urban-rural dynamics have substantial potential for influencing the extent to which voters are satisfied with democratic rule, yet we know little about the functioning and effects of such dynamics. Seeking to overcome this lacuna, we combine CSES survey data with measures of geographical centrality to explore how the distance of a respondent’s electoral constituency from the national capital influences levels of satisfaction with democracy. Using data covering 16 countries over a period of 25 years, we find that distance between the electoral district and the national capital lowers satisfaction with democracy. Yet, we also show that an interactive relationship exists between geographical distance and habitat size, with distance to the capital having a less negative effect in larger habitats. We further explore the political effects of this apparent geographical isolation and find that distance to the capital also lowers turnout.

This is a sustained trend in which some demands attained the desired policy responses and others have been repressed or ignored. We look into communicative or rhetorical responses of political elites as key intermediate outcomes of protest. Our analyses focus on two dimensions of responsiveness: the representatives’ willingness to (1) acknowledge the protesters, (2) engage with their specific concerns, and to (3) consider their demands by pushing the issues into the agenda. Using original data from protest events and tweets from representatives in four countries, between 2012 and 2022, we use computational linguistics techniques to measure direct responses to protest events and changes on issue attention by political elites. Our comparative results point to the importance of the national contexts, political systems, and how they interact with the attributes of the protesters and the events. Responsiveness to street politics in the Latin American context is central to understand the political inclusion of minorities, attention to crises, and the electoral support of progressive governments.

We reanalyse and extend two of such studies from Germany and the Netherlands. Our analysis reveals that unequal responsiveness transpires on very rare occasions. First, the affluent hold a substantively different minority position in only ca. 16 percent of the recorded public opinion surveys. Second, the predictive power of the affluent's policy preferences is only limited. This constraint hold for the published models as well as for models that account for preferences among different groups and differences across policy domains in the sampled data.

Making distributive choices in identical situations, we find that American politicians accept significantly more inequality than Norwegian politicians. Merit as opposed to luck as the source of inequality causes a large increase in elites' inequality acceptance in both countries, with a stronger effect in the US.

Macro-studies find that ethnic group-level economic inequalities are particularly likely to lead collective grievances, protest mobilization, and violent conflict compared with individual-level inequalities. Yet we have a very limited micro-evidence of these relationships. We argue that people are more likely to experience feelings of injustice and change their attitudes and behavior, when considering socioeconomic disparity at the group-level. Well-powered framing experiments in the United States, Bolivia, and Nigeria (N=4,800) demonstrate that priming respondents to think about social disparity in group terms causes respondents to perceive inequality as more unfair. Second, behavior games in the United States (N=1600) show that respondents are more supportive of redistributive policies when economic disparity coincides with group identities, but only if they are from a disadvantaged group. Finally, a set of 2x2 factorial experiments test the proposed mechanism by independently varying deservingness cues and group (vs. individual) inequality. Overall, our findings suggest that disadvantage is particularly likely to lead to grievances and support for remedial policies when economic inequality and ethnic identities line up.

The size of these gender gaps varies across time and space, and yet, the comparative literature on attitudinal gender gaps has largely neglected the role of the generational dimension and the political and policy context when it comes to accounting for this variation. In this paper, we look at both the generational and systemic influences on gender differences in attitudes towards redistribution and social spending. Broader contexts and welfare systems should be relevant for understanding attitudinal gender gaps in preferences for social spending and redistribution since women’s greater support for these measures is in theory linked to their greater reliance on welfare services, and so the manner and extent to which these are provided should affect demand in a gendered way. Using comparative survey data from European and Anglo-American democracies, we examine how the broader context impacts on the gender generation gap in support for redistribution and social spending.

The size of these gender gaps varies across time and space, and yet, the comparative literature on attitudinal gender gaps has largely neglected the role of the generational dimension and the political and policy context when it comes to accounting for this variation. In this paper, we look at both the generational and systemic influences on gender differences in attitudes towards redistribution and social spending. Broader contexts and welfare systems should be relevant for understanding attitudinal gender gaps in preferences for social spending and redistribution since women’s greater support for these measures is in theory linked to their greater reliance on welfare services, and so the manner and extent to which these are provided should affect demand in a gendered way.

And 2) what is the interaction between the two? Disentangling the independent and joint effects of individual and regional inequality allows us to test novel hypotheses on why local contexts affect individual attitudes. Our theoretical and empirical setup distinguishes between income-maximisation motivations (relative purchasing power or prospects of social mobility) or social integration mechanisms (social distrust, social status, or perceptions of social unfairness) as potential mechanisms to explain the effect of individual economic circumstances across declining or well-performing local contexts. To test our hypotheses, we draw on a large-scale, original, and randomised survey experiment in Great Britain. After gathering fine-grained pre-treatment income distributions at the household and local level, respondents are randomized into treatments highlighting objective household and regional inequality levels and changes, as well as subjective inequality levels. Preliminary analyses suggest that regional inequality levels are stronger predictors of anti-democratic and populist attitudes than individual conditions (i.e. sociotropic mechanism) and that subjective perceptions of local contexts are more powerful than objective information.

We devise several experiments creating exogenous variation in the level and structure of inequality and tax policy design that we field to samples of the adult population in Denmark, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Individuals are slightly more supportive of taxing the rich as inequality increases. Moreover, mass preferences strongly depend on the equalization potential of tax reforms: individuals value more progressivity, low tax intensity, and poor-friendliness. However, neither contextual nor self-centered inequality systematically change these sensitivities. Inequality also fails to induce meaningful shifts in the perceived ideological positions of tax reforms. We leverage these results to perform a stochastic frontier analysis identifying the relationship between tax reforms' equalization impact and public support. We find that there exist politically feasible tax reforms whose equalization potential exceeds that of the status quo.

The Interactive Effect of Immigration and Citizenship Regimes on Immigrants’ Nationality Acquisition	Classical normative theory assumes that to retain their legitimacy democracies should maximize the inclusion of long-term immigrant residents, and it is often assumed that this can be achieved by combining selective immigration policies with inclusive citizenship policies. In this paper, we explore to what extent greater selectiveness in immigration indeed amplifies the effect of (more) inclusive citizenship. Our empirical analysis uses observational survey data from the European Social Survey (ESS) to identify first-generation immigrants and combines the information about the timing of immigration with the policies they were exposed to when entering (immigration; measured using the IMPIC dataset) and the citizenship policies the encounter when they are at risk of naturalization (citizenship requirements after fulfilling the residence requirement; measured using the CITRIX dataset). We then move on to analyzing targeted sub-samples and employ various designs to reduce endogeneity concerns. Preliminary observational analyses support the empirical claim in the normative literature: the increase in naturalization propensities is greatest when immigrants are exposed to both relatively closed immigration regimes and relatively inclusive citizenship regimes.

Scholars have paid a great deal of attention to the importance of differences in physical boundaries and social barriers in international migration, but they have largely overlooked how variation in these boundaries and barriers affect domestic migration. In this paper we consider how subnational variation in the ease of migrants to move into communities (i.e., boundaries) and to cooperate with others once arrived (i.e., barriers) affects migrants' political participation. The paper draws on unique, extensive datasets of household and elite surveys, including over 20,000 individuals in nearly 2,400 localities of Malawi and Zambia. It shows that boundaries and barriers predict differences in the likelihoods that migrants are 1) registered to vote in the village and 2) likely to vote in alignment with the local leader. Moreover, it finds little reason to expect that selection into the neighborhood fully drives these effects. The results call upon both scholars and policymakers to better understand how subnational variation in the conditions migrants face affects political participation.

This paper investigates how changes in the partisan composition in government affect the political views and party preferences of stree-level bureaucrats. The research design uses the fact that most street-level bureaucrats in Germany are employed by their respective Bundesland, and elections to subnational parliaments that lead to a change in government composition can therefore be used to isolate the effect of a change in political principal – while holding the general political climate constant, as these changes only affect some, but not all, civil servants. The analysis uses a difference-in-difference model and monthly German Politbarometer survey data from 1977 to 2019 to estimate the effect of government turnover on the political views of street-level bureaucrats compared to those unaffected by the change in principal. The results indicate that there is indeed an increase in support for the (new) government parties among civil servants, but this ‘bureaucratic honeymoon’ may be short-lived.

We know less about why and how politicians and bureaucrats in hybrid regimes seek to regulate bureaucratic appointments, though it has great significance for bureaucratic and party politics and variations in capacity within such states. Using the case of Pakistan and drawing on data from interviews, semi-participant observation, and newspaper archives, I argue that politicians and bureaucrats counter political uncertainty by using bureaucratic appointments to regulate patronage and achieve electoral benefits, personal gains, protection, and bureaucratic performance. However, their ability to do so varies based on four factors: political capital; the curation of patronage relationships; the outcome sought; and the process by which the appointment is made. While extra-legal appointments are most likely to ensure success across these variables, there is significant disparity in experiences of the state across politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens. My findings have implications for understanding politician-bureaucrat interactions, the strategic management of political uncertainty, and sub-national variation in state capacity in hybrid regimes.

Case complexity is a key predictor in many studies of judicial politics. In particular, case complexity is used to explain judicial behaviour towards politics and society. However, the definition and operationalization of case complexity is underdeveloped. Scholars propose different ways to specify case complexity based on linguistic features, types of decisions or issue areas. Yet, we know very little about the assumptions guiding different operationalizations and their substantive implications. This article presents an in-depth discussion of different concepts of case complexity to explain how case complexity influences the strategic interaction of highest courts and public actors. First, the article presents how different measures of case complexity are supported theoretically by legal and political research. Second, the different measurements are assessed empirically for two archetypical highest courts: The German Federal Constitutional Court and the United States Supreme Court. To understand how different operationalization affect the study of judicial behaviour, the impact of briefs on transparency-inducing action by judges is analyzed. The results have major implications for studies on judicial behaviour and its implications for the strategic behaviour at highest courts.

Through a series of vignette experiments conducted among Sunni Arabs in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where the population has long been exposed to numerous justice systems (Islamic, tribal, and state), this research fills a gap in the extant research by causally identifying factors across different cases that drive selection of one system over another. Disputes within the family are generally directed towards customary orders, though participants prefer that more costly cases go to the state system. Sectarian outgroup dynamics are not as impactful as might be expected. Observational analyses demonstrate that Iraqis face a difficult choice between a highly corrupt, but highly powerful state system and less enforceable, seemingly less corrupt non-state orders. Women and respondents with lower-income tend to prefer non-state forums, which might be a result of structural inequalities.

Experimental Evidence from Hungary	In response to the growing specter of democratic backsliding, a new potential champion for the defense of democracy has emerged: international courts. Whether international courts can effectively halt democratic decay, however, is far from clear as these institutions are often seen as lacking the capacity to compel governments into changing their behavior. We argue that international courts can serve as potential protectors of democracy by galvanizing public opposition to democratic backsliding policies, particularly among citizens who trust the international court and value the international legal regime it represents. To evaluate our argument, we conducted an experiment embedded in a nationally-representative survey of 2000 respondents in Hungary. We presented respondents with one of two hypothetical anti-democratic policies which was subsequently invalidated either by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the Hungarian Constitutional Court, the Hungarian Constitutional Court based on an opinion by the CJEU, or was not evaluated by any court. Our findings indicate that a CJEU decision weakened citizens’ support for anti-democratic policies, albeit to a similar degree as a national court decision.

Experimental Evidence from Hungary	In response to the growing specter of democratic backsliding, a new potential champion for the defense of democracy has emerged: international courts. Whether international courts can effectively halt democratic decay, however, is far from clear as these institutions are often seen as lacking the capacity to compel governments into changing their behavior.

Contrary to prior research, we conceptualize transparency as a continuous dimension, which justices manage through the way they write opinions and press releases. To assess this argument we analyze Senate decisions and press releases published by the German Constitutional Court.

How different types of rebel groups respond to naming & shaming by the UN Security Council	What is the impact of naming & shaming on rebel violence against civilians? I argue that the response of rebel groups to naming & shaming depends on how deterrable these groups are. Rebel groups with a political wing, an embassy abroad, high support from the domestic population or a democratic external supporter, are relatively more deterrable as they are reliant on the domestic and international community. Naming & shaming decreases civilian victimization by these groups as they want to avoid legal and economic punishment or the loss of support. In contrast, rebel groups with access to lootable resources, with an autocratic external supporter or those that rely on forced funding are less deterrable as they are generally less reliant on the domestic population or the support of international actors that value the protection of civilians. Moreover, naming & shaming further isolates and threatens these groups, leading them to escalate violence to immediately improve their military capacity. Using new monthly data on naming & shaming of rebel groups by the UN Security Council, I find strong empirical support for these arguments.

Terrorist attacks intensify pre-existing ideological worldviews and partisan leanings and bring divisive political issues to the fore. Yet, they can also lead individuals from the entire political spectrum to come together and dissociate from the terrorists and their radical ideas. To identify causal effects, we exploit a series of natural experiments in Great Britain and leverage the timing of fatal far-right and Islamic terrorist attacks and the date of interview of respondents in the British Election Study. We find that Islamic attacks increase affective polarization whereas far-right attacks depolarize the electorate. We demonstrate that this discrepancy is largely driven by the salience of the attack -- and the resulting threat perceptions -- and the attitudes towards contentious and polarizing issues.

We problematize this view, noting that political entrepreneurs seek to alter the legacy of violence through manipulation of historical memory. To test whether the manipulation of historical memory alters the legacies of violence we study a natural experiment in the Spanish Civil War whereby the assignment of violence was orthogonal to the political characteristics of affected settlements. Leveraging the data on actual violence during the civil war, an original dataset on historical memorials, and outcome measures of political preferences and behavior from an original survey we ask whether (i) the pattern of memorialization faithfully reflects the experience of violence, and (ii) whether present-day attitudes and behavior are a legacy of the original experience of violence or of the subsequent policy of memorialization. We find that contemporary attitudes are often a product of memorialization rather than the original experience of violence. These findings suggest an important corrective in the field of legacy studies.

On the one hand, rumors could directly drive this support, especially in contexts where such information is readily believed. On the other hand, citizens could be motivated to support violence as a result of long-standing and deep societal cleavages, or due to beliefs about inept state capacity or positionality, with misinformation playing no causal role. To identify how misinformation intervenes in these events, we field an adapted conjoint-experiment in 6 districts (3 in India, 3 in Pakistan). Respondents react to a series of social media posts and professionally recorded audio newscasts describing acts of vigilantism and their follow-up. To isolate the impact of misinformation from other beliefs, we include several experimental variations in these prompts, before measuring their impact on support for vigilantism and on affective polarization.

The Role of Empowered Knowledge Workers	The number of companies that speak out on politically-charged and socially divisive issues has grown significantly in most advanced democracies. While some studies have focused on the influence of investors and consumers, less have paid attention to the increasing importance of employees. Under what conditions are firms more responsive to the preferences of the workforce than to those of other stakeholders such as investors and consumers? What specific form does this response take? Exploiting the growing role of employees in the charity donation activities of firms (via “matching donation programs”, paid volunteer days, or voting for their preferred charity partner), I build a novel database of workforce preferences and priorities at the firm level the US and the UK over seven years (2015-2021). By exploring exogenous shocks to the structure of the workforce, I show that firms increase their attention to diversity and inclusion issues after employees voice their concerns around these issues through volunteering or charity behaviour. More broadly, this paper expands our understanding of how knowledge workers can exert pressure on business rhetoric and behaviour in knowledge economies.

Analyzing novel survey data collected across 10 Western democracies, we employ text analysis techniques to investigate responses to open-ended questions. We examine variations in how people interpret ideological dimensions along three levels of analyses: across countries, based on demographic features, and based on partisan identities. Our results suggests that there are multiple two-dimensional spaces: that is, different groups ascribe different meanings to what the economic and cultural political divides stand for. Our findings make theoretical contributions to the study of electoral politics and political ideology.

Following saliency theory, we extract fundamental dimensions of political space from issue emphasis and validate these ideal points with self-reported positions from the GLES candidate study.We find that a central left-right dimension is generally sufficient to describe differences between candidates in terms of political communication. They correlate with about .8 with self-reported positions and partly predict deviation in roll-call votes. This shows social media complements existing data for party-centered systems.

When analyzing these parties, most of the academic literature analyzes a single election or several combined. This research aims to show the dynamic emergence of new parties and how they attract different profiles of voters at different elections. Through a comparative analysis of several new parties around Europe, it shows how new parties initially attract voters with a higher educational level, while once they enter parliament and prove their viability, they start attracting voters who subjectively feel poorer. In addition, an in-depth precinct-level analysis of the emergence and spread of Vox, Podemos, and Sweden Democrats shows how these parties spread from precincts with higher incomes to those with lower incomes. These results underpin that the ‘left behind’ hypothesis takes place once new parties are in parliament, but voters with higher levels of education boost new parties before their entrance into parliament.

Empirical studies have shown consistent chromatic patterns in left-right party families. This paper contributes to this literature on political symbols by focusing on a less investigated but politically rising group: European green parties. Conventional wisdom suggests that these parties show maximum color consistency (isomorphism). Challenging this view, we show that European green parties vary significantly in terms of color patterns and, therefore, ideology association in recent years. Using a new dataset of green parties’ logos and state-of-the-art color analysis techniques, we also show the domestic and international correlates of green parties’ logo variation. This research has important implications for the associations and divergences across green and classical left-right parties. The results also suggest under which conditions green parties are more or less likely to express their identity following the homonymous color.

No democratic country has been shielded from the governance challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, governments have had to manage not only a public health crisis, but also an economic crisis precipitated by the virus. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 crisis has affected support for, or satisfaction with the performance of, incumbent governments. In this paper, we seek to understand, from a comparative perspective, how citizens evaluate the performance of governments in managing the crisis. We field a conjoint experiment in 18 countries across six continents where individuals are asked to evaluate incumbents using information on both their economic and public health-related performance. In total, our data contains responses from over 22,000 individuals, who collectively made over 177,000 choices in the experiment. Leveraging the large amount of data collected, we explore treatment effect heterogeneity using machine learning techniques.

During every crisis of representative democracy, there is a surge of demands for more direct forms of participation. Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the Five Star Movement in current-day Italy -- discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actor in the formulation of these demands? We ask why political parties call and/or support direct democracy. We provide two major motivations: ideology and strategy. Analyzing party manifestos of European parties from 1946 onward, we show how ideological motivations seem to account for most variation in party positions towards direct democracy. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins as well as it helps to better understand whether direct democracy is endogenous with certain outcomes or not.

In this paper, I argue that ruling parties can strategically use direct-democracy mechanisms – such as recall elections – to strengthen discipline within the party. I develop a formal model to show how national party leaders can strategically use a referendum in order to learn information about the loyalty and competence of local party officials. I evaluate two implications of the model using data from Mexico’s 2022 presidential referendum recall, which was launched by sitting president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador against himself. First, I present evidence – including regression-discontinuity estimates – that suggests the results of the referendum were shaped by the mobilization efforts of mayors from the president’s party (MORENA). Second, I plan to explore whether the results of the referendum were used to reward high-performing MORENA mayors with greater opportunities for career advancement. These results have important implications for the growing literature on the use and abuse of direct democracy.

Positional adaptation mechanisms of political parties in times of crises.	How do parties react to environments of uncertainty such as international crises caused by external shocks? Contemporary literature emphasizes that political parties do not respond uniformly to a changing environment. This article argues that positional adaptation mechanisms in response to an external shock follow distinct rules, due to the focusing character of crises. I propose that electoral success and previous positional shifts within the topical dimension of the external shock influence consecutive adaptations. To test these arguments, I draw upon the global financial crisis and the European refugee crisis, as recent examples. Utilizing manually coded party manifestos of nine countries across central and north-western Europe based on the Comparative Manifesto Project and the Comparative Agendas Project, I identify the underlying topical textual data. Afterwards I apply unsupervised scaling methods to generate individual party positions on these issues. Last, I analyze the impact of these crises on consecutive positional adaptions using regression models. The results hold implications for existing and future research of comparative politics and international crises, especially in light of more events across Europe.

Importantly, this is not only because left parties are less willing to reduce borrowing, but also because of asymmetric features in the way that voters perceive the links between taxes, spending, and borrowing. Survey and experimental evidence from the UK indicate that voters link the problem of borrowing to the expenditure side of the budget than the revenue side, with spending cuts more readily seen as the solution to the problem of a deficit. Left parties' association with spending hurts them; right parties' association with tax cuts does not. Finally, right parties press home this advantage. We present evidence from the UK, Germany and USA that right parties seek to mobilise the issue of borrowing, as well as riding the favourable currents of high-borrowing periods.

Using comprehensive comparative survey data, text data, and experiments, our study explores the conditions under which democracy provides and prevents innovations from emerging. We focus on the role of moral economic norms in democracies and the inherent moral character of technology protectionism in pluralistic societies. In our study, we use a subjective risk assessments and cross-country survey experiments to measure citizens' preferences for curtailing certain aspects of emerging technologies, such as sharing data or acceptance of risks relating to AI. Our results suggest that citizens often prefer to curtail aspects of technology in line with predominant social norms, while still promoting the acquisition of new skills and participation in growth generated by these technologies. We discuss the implications of heterogeneous but compressed preferences for technology protectionism on the ability of advanced democracies to match the requirements of modern market economies.

Are they complementary, or are there political or budgetary trade-offs or trilemmas that undermine parallel commitment to pre-distribution, redistribution, and social investment? After a brief survey of the evidence that the scrutinized policies are indeed equality enhancing, we map existing research in favor of negative and positive sum relationships (trade-offs and complementarities) theoretically and empirically. After this overview, we leverage a new dataset on pre-distribution, redistribution, and social investment policy to tackle this question: First, we show the trajectories of 16 OECD countries on these three dimensions, then we take stock of linkages, lags and scope conditions, and the temporal changes in these linkages. We find very little evidence that zero-sums from con-joint survey experiments translate into observed within-country policy trade-offs, and between countries complementarities still dominate. Our findings call into question assessments that look at the three dimensions in isolation and argue in favor of a more policy-centered perspective on the pathways to equality.

This paper examines how reduced levels of government policy autonomy affect political behaviour. We argue that voters only become aware of the limited electoral accountability of their governments when highly economically integrated countries are asymmetrically hit by severe economic shocks. We expect electoral behaviour to be generally stable, and electoral volatility to increase only when reduced policy autonomy becomes evident to voters. Using the exposure of Western democracies to economic shocks and diverging levels of economic interdependence between 1957 and 2020, we first examine at the macro level how electoral volatility between establishment and non-establishment parties is affected by varying levels of economic and political integration in the event of an economic shock. At the micro-level, we then use survey data from the two rotating modules on democracy included in the European Social Survey 2012 and 2020 to understand if shifts in electoral volatility are actually due to voters lacking policy choices.

Investigating the Nature and Significance of Interim Regimes	Interim regimes, or transitional governments as they are also called, often play an important role in the outcome of democratization processes. When established after, e.g., the overthrow of a long-ruling autocrat, they can play pivotal roles in a polity’s political development, potentially working as a critical juncture that determines whether a country again consolidates autocratic rule under a different ruling coalition or takes substantial steps towards democracy. Despite their importance, research on interim regimes is fragmented, and in quantitative research almost absent. One reason for this is the lack of useful data on interim regimes. In this paper, we take steps to remedy this by classifying and mapping all transitional regimes since 1789 and their key characteristics, identifying 215 interim regimes across modern political history. Importantly, our data reveals that these transitional governments are followed by a democratic regime in only half of the cases. And, in almost 40% of the cases, an interim regime is established after a coup deposes a democratic regime with an aim to install a new democratic regime.

When established after, e.g., the overthrow of a long-ruling autocrat, they can play pivotal roles in a polity’s political development, potentially working as a critical juncture that determines whether a country again consolidates autocratic rule under a different ruling coalition or takes substantial steps towards democracy. Despite their importance, research on interim regimes is fragmented, and in quantitative research almost absent. One reason for this is the lack of useful data on interim regimes. In this paper, we take steps to remedy this by classifying and mapping all transitional regimes since 1789 and their key characteristics, identifying 215 interim regimes across modern political history. Importantly, our data reveals that these transitional governments are followed by a democratic regime in only half of the cases. And, in almost 40% of the cases, an interim regime is established after a coup deposes a democratic regime with an aim to install a new democratic regime.

Drivers of Incumbent- versus External Takeovers, 1789-2020	When democracies break down, the culpable actors come either from outside (typically military officers) or inside (typically elected presidents) the elite circles of the former democratic regime. We discuss how the incentives of different actors to subvert democracy may be influenced asymmetrically by different factors, but also discuss how strategic interaction between different actors (e.g., military officers making a pre-emptive coup to mitigate the chances of a chief executive self-coup) may affect how socio-economic and institutional factors relate to various types of democratic breakdown. In this paper, we provide the, so far, most comprehensive study on the drivers of different types of democratic breakdown. We first present a multidimensional categorization of democratic breakdown processes, before discussing theoretical expectations on two key sets of determinants, namely shocks that should alleviate collective action problems for coup plotters as well as institutional constraints on incumbents. We find that economic crisis is clearly related to higher risk of non-incumbent takeover, but not to incumbent-driven breakdown of democracy. In contrast, we find that various types of institutional constraints are related to both types of breakdown.

While increasing levels of fragmentation and polarization are richly documented in Western democracies, few, if any, democracies have failed. We turn to the European interwar period (1919-1939) to investigate the interplay between political polarization and fragmentation of party systems as an explanation of democratic deconsolidation. We introduce novel data on party systems in 25 European democracies and 130 democratic elections during the interwar period and propose a multi-dimensional measurement of polarization that is not a function of fragmentation. We show that it is systems with few parties and high polarization, as well as systems with many parties and low polarization that are among the least stable. Thus, the consequences of fragmentation and polarization for democratic stability can only be understood when studied in interaction. This point towards two types of dis-functioning party systems: one in which neither of only two parties addresses the median voter, and one in which too many parties compete over the same set of voters.

This study explores the factors that contribute to the reelection of a first-term mayor. The literature has revealed findings on the conditions for incumbency advantage in elected officials. However, the connection between the mayors' policy choices and their reelection is largely unaddressed. Mayors’ policy choices in their first terms could potentially be critical for their reelection because far-reaching changes in existing policies could lead to dissatisfaction among local politicians and electorates and invite strong challengers in the next election. This study analyses all mayoral elections in Japan from 1999 to 2018. There are three types of first-term mayors, successors named by the previous mayor, winners of races without incumbents, and challengers who have beaten the incumbents. We claim that each type has different policy expectations held by local politicians and electorates and betraying them could cost their reelection. We investigate how each type of mayor would gain or suffer from the policy change measured from the shift in the composition of fiscal expenditures.

No, but Yes	According to a widely held view, economic inequality undermines democracy. While the link between inequality and regime change has been studied extensively, the relationship between economic inequality and the degree of democraticness in countries with free, inclusive elections is underexplored. Inspired by Dahl, we distinguish between democratic quality understood as the fulfilment of procedural-institutional features on the one hand and as substantive political equality on the other hand. We expect that while economic inequality might not undermine democracy understood in a procedural-institutional fashion, the stronger principle of political inequality is more likely to be affected by economic disparities. To examine these predictions, we analyze time-series cross-section data spanning the period 1960-2020 using two-way fixed effects estimators. Our results indicate that economic inequality, measured as income inequality, is not a robust predictor of democratic quality understood as the fulfilment of procedural-institutional criteria associated with polyarchy and liberal democracy. However, income inequality is a robust predictor of two different proxies of political inequality. Whether economic inequality harms democratic quality thus depends on how demanding our concept of democracy is.

In this paper, we argue that these monarchs’ apolitical nature unifies their subjects and encourages cooperation, trust, and consensus among citizens and elites. As such, citizens of democratic parliamentary monarchies are on average more satisfied with democracy than those of republics. To test our argument, we utilize the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Surveys and the European Social Surveys (ESS) to measure citizens’ political attitudes and opinions on democracy, and the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys and the MARPOR datasets to measure parties’ ideological positions. We also conduct a survey experiment to test our theory’s causal mechanism. Both sets of results support our hypotheses: democratic parliamentary monarchs reduce citizens’ perceived ideological distances with parties; this, in turn, raises citizens’ satisfaction with democracy. These results suggest that perhaps counterintuitively, constitutional monarchies can safeguard countries against deterioration of democratic legitimacy.

Exploiting the time-varying and rotating nature of municipality-specific pre-electoral polls for local elections in Spain, I find that pre-electoral polls significantly increase the vote share concentration for the top two candidates as well as the gap with the third most voted candidate. The results are consistent with models and lab experiments featuring aggregate uncertainty, which favors the emergence of non-Duverger's law equilibria in plurality elections. Moreover, they outline the relevance of pre-electoral polls as a policy tool to facilitate voters' coordination.

Notably, we know that PMs with unilateral assembly dissolution powers tend to schedule elections timed to their advantage. We also know that the opposition’s vote share is boosted by the employment of no-confidence motions, even though these are usually struck down. Yet, we know little about the electoral implications of -arguably- one of the most powerful instruments afforded to parliamentary administrations: the vote of confidence procedure. Governments formally engage responsibility for different purposes, from reversing legislative defeats to prioritizing and molding cabinet proposals. Occasionally, the procedure has been invoked for extremely salient and controversial issues. In this article, I investigate voters’ reactions to the calling and the outcome of votes of confidence initiated by the executive.

In countries with multi-party proportional electoral systems -- the majority of democracies -- the mapping from electoral gains to government inclusion is less clear. For this reason, scholars have often held that election results matter more for who governs in majoritarian systems. We show here that this distinction is not as large as previously thought, namely that parties that lose vote share in multi-party systems are less likely to be included in coalition governments. Although the mechanical determinant is missing in proportional multi-party systems, accountability for election results is still very much reflected in government composition.

Research suggests that non-violent dissent campaigns outperform violent campaigns in fostering transitions from dictatorship to democracy, largely because non-violence induces security force defection. We move up the conceptual ladder of abstraction and shift attention from defection to disloyalty, identifying seven types of disloyal or subversive actions: (1) stop supporting the regime, (2) quit the security apparatus, (3) join the opposition movement, (4) voice support for the opposition or voice criticism to the regime, (5) idling (or shirking), (6) barracking and/or, (7) coup d'etat. We theorize that violent and non-violent strategies are linked to different disloyal actions, and derive propositions about the effect of dissent strategies on specific disloyal actions. We find that specific types of disloyal actions are related to different campaign strategies: security forces are more likely to be idling, voicing loyalty to the campaign or quit supporting the regime during non-violent campaigns, while members of the security forces quitting the security apparatus and joining the campaign are more common during violent campaigns.

Anecdotal evidence from England, however, suggests certain groups, all ‘Leftist’, are increasingly unable to exercise these rights for fear of police reprisal. Due to recent reports, this paper empirically investigates how partisanship impacts police response. We primarily rely on the ACLED’s observational protest data, which already includes spatial and temporal measures. Using machine learning, observations are supplemented with a binary and a categorical measure denoting police response and severity, respectively. Protestor partisanship is manually assigned using expert surveys and the analysis of group manifestos and political communications. As police response is an inconsistent variable, this paper leans on non-parametric Bayesian estimation methods to fill gaps created by limited or missing data. Through Spatio-temporal Gaussian Process Regression, county-level models of predicted response are rendered. In short, this paper demonstrates the space-specific likelihood that the Left will be over-policed and, by that corollary, that the Right will be under-policed over time.

The discussion has centred around how different types of political regimes have been able to cope with a huge public health problem, also highlighting the erosive effects of neoliberal policies on the provision of public services in advanced democracies. Nobody so far has put the focus on the role of socialism and, beyond the hunt for contemporary explanations, on the existence of long-term regime-driven legacies that may have had an impact on the containment of Covid-related deaths. What I claim in this paper is that countries that went through successful socialist revolutions have specific features that equip them with better resources to cope with public challenges such as pandemics. I also claim that these features remain even after the demise of the socialist regime. I find a positive effect of socialist revolutions over Covid-19 containment. This effect seems to be channeled through institutions with stronger capabilities, and in societies with a larger preference for collective values over individual freedom.

What are the consequences of historical state intervention in environmental conservation? Deforestation was a major issue in early 19th century France, and politicians viewed the excess use of communal land as its main cause. In 1827, the state passed a Forest code which limited longstanding use rights on most forests. The law led to major revolts in several forested regions of France, where peasants relied on these rights to complement their income. Using detailed data on forest geography and the gradual application of the Forest code, I show the impact of state intervention in forest conservation on local development, compliance with the law and revolts against state authority.

The Effects of the Urban Terrain on Government Violence during Civil War	Physical infrastructure is commonly used as a proxy for state reach and capacity. Cities tend to be strongholds of the state and to have dense built-up infrastructures. Military practitioners, however, suggest that, during civil conflict, the urban infrastructure might weaken state's abilities to punish rebellions because they add logistical constraints for governments. For instance, conventional artillery is hard to use. Mobility might be more difficult in small roads and lines of sight to re are diminished due to the presence of buildings. Despite the extensive availability of data to measure the built-up infrastructure of cities, there has been scant research on how this affects government violence. With ne-grained data of more than 140 000 victims from the Syrian conflict, I investigate whether and how the urban topography affects the levels of government violence.

However, not all behave as outright sycophants, and not all ‘yes-men’ pander to the ruler to the same degree. Why not? Building on social psychological research on ingratiation strategies and studies on personality cults, we argue that: i) ‘playing the sycophant’s card’ is a strategy that mainly weaker elites, more dependent on the autocrat, resort to; and ii) weaker elites that use this strategy are rewarded for their public subordination. To test these hypotheses, we employ a novel empirical approach for measuring elite loyalty in autocracies. Using text-as-data methods, we analyze original data on almost 1000 annual addresses of Russian governors to regional parliaments from 2007 to 2021. We find that governors up for election/reappointment and those more dependent on transfers from the center are indeed more likely to praise President Putin in their speeches and also tend to emphasize the same kind of topics and words as him. We also show that Putin’s ‘yes-men’ survive longer in office and receive more perks.

It entails a certain degree of ideological correspondence between the general public and the political elites in terms of positioning and policy preferences. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic implied urgent and effective political responses to face the crisis with emerging new debates on how to handle the crisis and what to prioritize. These trade-offs such as health vs. the economy forced political parties to adopt an ideological stance while voters formed a solid opinion on the matter. By relying on Chapel Hill Expert Survey and European Social Survey Round 10 data, the paper investigates the level of congruence between parties and voters on how to handle the pandemic in different European countries. Mainstream and vote-maximisation-orientated parties were more likely to be congruent with the population, whereas niche and policy-orientated parties were more congruent with their constituencies. Ideology and the role of the party in parliament also played an important role in moderating the level of congruence. The findings are relevant to the debates on the functioning of democratic representation.

How the Diffusion of Executive Power Affects Crisis Management and Party Dynamics	As a crisis requiring swift political reactions, Covid-19 has uncovered dynamics of multi-level governance that are hidden in normal times. While most studies analysing party dynamics in the context of Covid-19 focused on the national level, few studies investigated multi-level party dynamics. Thus, this article analyses under which conditions regional party associations deviate from their federal party’s position on Covid-19. Making use of the German federal system, we contend that deviations from the federal party can be explained by sub-national differences in political configurations and in the intensity of the crisis. We compiled a new dataset of more than 65,000 press releases issued by all parties and executives that are represented in German state parliaments and the Bundestag between January 2020 and May 2022. To test our theoretical propositions, we rely on semi-supervised text models that enable us to trace the policy positions of sub-national and federal parties and executives. With this study, we contribute to the understanding of the interplay of political actors in multi-level governance and shed light on intra-party dynamics between the sub-national and federal level.

Making use of the German federal system, we contend that deviations from the federal party can be explained by sub-national differences in political configurations and in the intensity of the crisis. We compiled a new dataset of more than 65,000 press releases issued by all parties and executives that are represented in German state parliaments and the Bundestag between January 2020 and May 2022. To test our theoretical propositions, we rely on semi-supervised text models that enable us to trace the policy positions of sub-national and federal parties and executives. With this study, we contribute to the understanding of the interplay of political actors in multi-level governance and shed light on intra-party dynamics between the sub-national and federal level.

Corruption Victimization and the Electoral Effects of the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion	When do voters punish incumbents for corruption? The literature suggests that while citizens generally dislike corruption, this distaste often does not translate into changes in electoral behaviour – specifically so in low and middle income countries. Common explanations hold that corruption may never be salient enough to foster changes at the ballot boxes, or that long standing loyalties and clientelistic ties override citizens' aversion to malfeasance. What, however, if corruption """"""""blows up in people's faces""""""""? This paper investigates the electoral effects of the 2020 """"""""Beirut Blast"""""""", when 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate ripped a whole in Lebanon's capital, killed hundreds, maimed thousands, and destroyed the homes of a quarter of a million citizens. Building on (1) the observations that the event was widely perceived as a result of corruption, (2) the assessment that the location of Beirut's port is exogenous to vote choice and relevant correlates, and (3) the laws of thermodynamics, I use euclidian distance to the explosion as a proxy for corruption victimization, and measure its impact on new entrant voteshares in the 2022 Lebanese general elections.

COVAX was established as an institution to oversee the equitable distribution of vaccines, but it failed to follow through on its mission because wealthy countries with vaccines prioritized their own domestic political considerations. Without more equitable distribution, SARS-CoV-2 continued to mutate in countries with low vaccination rates, prolonging the pandemic. Because domestic political pressures limited the willingness of political leaders to share vaccines globally, this study experimentally tests two strategies for increasing popular support for giving vaccines to foreign countries. First, it assesses whether public opinion becomes more supportive of sharing vaccines following cues from fairness and equity concerns in vaccine distribution. Second, it assesses whether public opinion becomes more supportive when equitable vaccine distribution is framed as a matter of self-interest for wealthy countries. This study finds that the self-interest frame is better suited to improving support for vaccine sharing. In some cases, the fairness frame prompts backlash against sharing instead.

Do policymakers with relevant expertise act more quickly in crisis situations? We examine this question in the context of government responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, where commentators suggested a link between policymakers having a “science” or medical background and the speed of lockdown decisions. We examine possible underlying mechanisms and test this relationship empirically with a global dataset of the educational background of up to 188 political leaders and 181 health ministers in office at the start of the pandemic. Our empirical setup does not suffer from two prominent threats to valid inference, namely reciprocal causation and sample selection bias. Using several statistical tests, we find little support for a systematic relationship between policymakers who studied a natural science or medicine and the timing of the first lockdown or an otherwise “stringent” policy response. However, our results suggest that populist leaders and dictators dampen the effect of medical expertise in the health portfolio on the speed of lockdown. These results elucidate the political conditions under which leaders may suppress expertise relevant to a crisis.

The aim of this study is twofold. First, it analyses if the urban-rural cleavage has increased in the parliamentary and public debate. Second, it explores how the entry of new rural parties may influence the discourse of state-wide parties. We expect regionalist parties have representation in the national legislature after a period of low regional references. We use data from legislatures and apply a dictionary-supervised text analysis to Spanish-written parliamentary questions to predict MPs mentions in rural/urban topics. By focusing on Spain's legislature terms, we can compare MPs' references to the diverse geographical areas when there are rural and periphery representatives or not in the national legislature in the parliament (2011-2022). We differentiate regionalist and periphery parties and regional MPs from state-wide parties because of the different party targets. This longitudinal analysis holds relevant implications in the periphery and rural-urban studies and the MPs' political behaviour in multilevel countries using quantitative text analysis.

The Long-Run Evolution of Ideological Spatial Sorting in Spain	Social divisions are growing, with ideologically opposed citizens exhibiting homophily in a range of seemingly nonpolitical domains. In fact, it has been widely claimed, and recently increasingly studied, that this ideological social divide extends to individuals’ decisions about where to live. While most of the evidence so far focuses on the American case, in other countries, reports of growing geographic political polarization raise the issue of the ways in which spatial sorting might occur under different institutional frameworks. In this paper, we document the long-run evolution of geographic sorting along ideological lines in Spain, a decentralized multiparty democracy with salient territorial tensions. We provide evidence that spatial cleavages have increased dramatically since the beginning of the new century. At no point since the Great Recession have citizens been as clustered within the boundaries of individual regions as today. Nonetheless, even when geographic sorting is measured at the municipal level within these regions, differences across communities tend to follow a similar segregation logic.

The Electoral Consequences of Modern Pilgrimage	According to Allport´s (1954) intergroup contact theory, positive effects can arise from social interaction when different conditions are met. Nowadays, urban cities are exposed to daily fluent intergroup contact between its citizens, while rural areas remain more stagnant, being contact between people with homogeneous backgrounds the most frequent social interaction. Does the increase in intergroup social contact increase the support of economic integration policies in rural areas? We take advantage of the Camino de Santiago modern pilgrimage. By exploiting the recognition of new routes as part of the official itinerary, I compare turnout and voting behavior in the EU parliamentary elections between those rural areas which obtained the official pilgrimage credential to those border areas in which the status remained unchanged. The former experienced an increase in both national and international pilgrim flows compared to their counterparts. By developing a Difference-in-Difference, I show that those places in which intergroup contact experienced a boost, turnout in EU parliamentary elections increased, suggesting a change in European integration preferences.

Does residential mobility transform electoral behavior? The new urban neighborhoods of large European cities represent a major change in the socialization of citizens towards an individualistic pattern and a break with their previous lifestyle. These new forms of socialization and relationship with the environment can lead to a transformative change that is reflected in new political attitudes and the voting behavior. However, there are reduced previous work on this topic. To fill this gap, I geolocate the intra-municipal quasi-random residential mobility of the last decades in Spain, to estimate the impact of residential mobility on voting behavior and know whether residential mobility is the mechanism underlying the new forms of voting.

We improve on this analysis in two respects.

A Conjoint Experiment on Arab Preferences in Six Arab Countries	To what extent do youth, who make up two-thirds of the population in majority Arab countries, view gender as determining candidate quality? Conventional wisdom holds that Arab citizens prefer male candidates, but also that youth hold different attitudes toward older generations. Using a conjoint experiment fielded to over 30,000 youth in six Arab countries, it explores youth's attitudes toward women in leadership positions. We find that youth are more likely to say that they would support female than male candidates. Moreover, they believe that female candidates are more capable across activities, including those stereotypically considered to be under men's purview - such as ensuring security and raising funds for the locality. Responses to candidate gender vary across demographic groups, with males and more religious citizens, both male and female, more likely to prefer male candidates. The study extends existing literature on youth and gender by exploring how youth see female candidates and being the first, to our knowledge, to show a preference for female candidates among some constituencies in MENA countries.

We argue that previous studies usually do not consider ethnic voting and ethnic parties as co-constitutive phenomena. This complicates models of individual vote choice which take parties as exogenously given. We shed new light on ethnic voting and party systems by modeling both as the partitioning of a network of voters into parties. Our methodological approach estimates the effect of ethnicity on voters partitioning while controlling for confounders. Based on Afrobarometer surveys, initial results show strong and robust effects of co-ethnicity between two voters on the probability of them choosing the same party and thus the endogenous emergence of ethnically aligned parties, conditional on individual and geographic covariates. We explore the mechanisms by which ethnicity increases co-ethnic vote choice and alternative, non-ethnic explanations of place, economic interests, and historical contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential of our approach to narrow the gap between the study of micro-level voting and macro-level party systems more broadly.

Consequently, ethnic parties have been assumed as naturally bad for democracy, polarizing party systems and promoting communal conflicts. Therefore, many constitutions of young democracies contain bans for ethnic, religious, territorial, or exclusive parties. Scholars have already nuanced the consequences of ethnic parties, and the abuses of ethnic party bans. However, we lack assessments on the effects of such bans on voters, such as those belonging to ethnic minorities. In short, does an ethnic party ban negatively influence voter perceptions of discrimination, namely the feeling of being treated more unfairly by the government? The study hypothesizes that ethnic party bans might have negative consequences for democracy by increasing the perceived exclusiveness of the regime and the predicament of ethnic groups, in particular for those (usually, minorities) affected by the ban.

Consequently, ethnic parties have been assumed as naturally bad for democracy, polarizing party systems and promoting communal conflicts. Therefore, many constitutions of young democracies contain bans for ethnic, religious, territorial, or exclusive parties.

However, we lack assessments on the effects of such bans on voters, such as those belonging to ethnic minorities. In short, does an ethnic party ban negatively influence voter perceptions of discrimination, namely the feeling of being treated more unfairly by the government?

The limits to the political communities emerging from independence were heavily influenced by the region’s colonial past. However, we observe variation over time and across countries, arguably because of differences in ethnic mobilization. This paper aims to test under which conditions groups improved their status within the national project by mobilizing in the 19th century, focusing on the opening of political communities in the early 20th century. Thanks to the novel Latin American Revolts Database (LARD), we can test the impact of revolts from this period. Following previous literature, I hypothesize that ethnic groups that faced divided elites and those who mobilized through formal structures were more likely to improve their status in the national project. Empirically, I identify ethnic revolts in LARD and code elite-group alliances, inter-elite disputes and the use of formal structures to mobilize. To assess their success, I code ethnic groups' political status until 1930. These findings are relevant to understand how groups can escape exclusionary policies, especially those with long-term historical roots.

Yet, many minorities suffer in silence, fearing that asserting ethnic identity and participating in protest will challenge their commitment to the nation in the eyes of broader society. In this article, I theorize that collective action frames that draw on national symbols and portray ethnic grievances as pertaining to the nation, more broadly, can strengthen support for resistance movements among ethnic minorities. I test this theory through an original survey experiment with a sample of Indian Muslims (N=1,311) in the context of rising Hindu nationalism. The findings reveal that “national identity frames” strengthen support for ethnic resistance while “ethnic identity frames” weaken support when the centrality of Hindu identity to the Indian nation is salient. The findings suggest that minorities are more supportive of protest movements that employ collective action frames depicting ethnic resistance as an act of patriotism.

I argue that the organizational structure utilized by right wing terrorists contributes to this mismatch in public and policy attention. I use a content analysis of primary sources, manifestos, and court records to illustrate that the racist far right movement is better described as an ideological network of actors than a string of lone wolf perpetrators. I then develop a theory that highly visible organizations support a psychological strategy, whereas networked and clandestine structures support a recruitment and movement-building strategy. Lastly, I collect data from an original survey experiment, testing whether priming respondents about the presence of violent hate groups in the crowd at the January 6th insurrection affects whether they view far right organizations as a threat to democracy in the United States and/or internationally. This study contributes to our understanding of terrorist strategies and specifically to our understanding of the extreme right.

Research on the public perception of political parties shows that informational cues matter for the assessment of party positions. Still, the role of government participation deserves more investigation. Gaining office should be a particularly important signal for populist and radical parties to be perceived as part of the political establishment. Indeed, the inclusion in a government coalition would legitimize them and boost their image as moderate actors. I hypothesise that in general, a populist party is perceived as more moderate when included in a government coalition. Additionally, I expect a moderating effect of supporting the party on the perceived position. In fact, voters who dislike the party also tend to inform themselves less about it and rely on weaker cues to assess its stances. Non-supporters would therefore be more permeable to the portraying of those actors as radical or, conversely, as legitimate government members, in the media. Relying on survey and panel data on the public perception of Podemos (Spain), FPÖ (Austria) and Fratelli d’Italia (Italy), this paper contributes to the study of coalition heuristics and populism in power.

Why are cities different? In large cities, segregation reduces the probability of contact between immigrants and natives and, hence, it reduces the salience of the immigration issue in the decision of how to cast a ballot. I show that citizens of large cities in France are more likely to vote more for far-right parties in response to immigration when segregation is low. The effect fades away as segregation increases. When the electoral response to immigration is analysed at the polling station level, i.e. when segregation is naturally controlled for, then standard results in the literature appear; more immigration is associated with more far-right vote, and more so if immigrants compete with natives for welfare.

We also explore country-level factors, namely whether a political system is open or closed.

Once core constituents of social democratic parties, labor unions are weaker than they once were and parties with roots in mass-based labor movements have become increasingly centrist, causing them to drift away from their mass-based roots. Many disaffected voters, in turn, have shifted their support to parties and candidates on the radical right. Based on primary and secondary interview, document, and press-based source materials collected in Germany, this paper seeks to develop an argument about the future of unions as agents of (renewed) class-based voter mobilization and, as such, an antidote to the growing success of the radical right. Has the connection between mainstream social democratic parties and rank and file union members weakened to a point of no return? How can unions reinvent themselves as successful agents of labor-based political mobilization in the modern era?

I argue that ethnic and religious diversity render a population more illegible to the state and increase the costs of the state's investment in fiscal capacity. Higher costs discourage the state's investment in fiscal capacity in more diverse areas and hinder fiscal capacity building there. Higher costs of investment under higher diversity also make the state divert investment to less diverse areas, populated by the core groups. This places the tax burdens of state building on the members of the core groups. Empirically, I test these expectations with an original dataset of local-level fiscal revenues in late Ottoman Empire I collected from hundreds of archival documents in addition to other quantitative and qualitative data from archival sources. I find that wartime increases in fiscal capacity were higher in less diverse localities and the mechanism that drives this difference is diversity discouraging investment in fiscal capacity by increasing its costs.

Existing theories of state building are developed specifically based on this Western European trajectory to fiscal and bureaucratic centralization. Yet, recent literature shows that the European path to modern state building is not repeated in the developing world. So, how did the modern state develop across the world? This study argues that it diffused to the world from Western Europe through two mechanisms: competition and colonization. Using a cross-country dataset of colonized and non-colonized countries, the analysis shows that the impact of early (pre-1500) statehood on current state capacity is conditional on colonization. Early statehood is positively associated with modern state capacity for non-colonized countries (diffusion with competition), while the relationship between early statehood and modern state capacity is negative for colonized countries (diffusion with colonization). I support this global analysis with a closer look at the selected cases of diffusion across the world to illustrate the mechanisms.

In this article we contend that state capacity ultimately influences equal provision of social benefits and services in healthcare and education. We do so by identifying three distinct, although interrelated, mechanisms through which state capacity determines equitable social policy. Administrative capacity allows the regime to successfully implement its intended social policy decisions, extractive capacity has a direct effect on both tax revenues and social policy outcomes, and coercive capacity determines the success of the state to promptly respond to citizens’ demands for social benefits and services. Our empirical approach draws on a set of static and dynamic regressions models for over 120 countries from 1960 to 2016. The findings confirm that state capacity enhances equitable social policy in authoritarian contexts, although the effect tends to dissipate in the long run. The results hold in various robustness tests.

A study on the alternation of regional governments.	One of the main features of democracy is that citizens can vote the incumbents out of office. This accountability mechanism should guarantee that governments are responsive to the preferences of its citizens. Even though most regions in Europe now have some form of electoral democracy, electoral accountability at the regional level has received little attention. This lack of attention is surprising given that parliamentary-executive relations at the regional level are quite different from those at the national level. In addition, there are several reasons to expect that electoral accountability might be obfuscated: as regional government formations follow consociational norms in many regions, numerous regions are dominated by a single party, and national parties can influence strategies of regional party branches. In this paper, we explore the link between regional election results and regional government alternations. We study all the regional governments that were been formed in almost 3.000 regional elections in 294 regions, in 15 Western European countries. The results indicate that how regional electoral democracy is organized strongly influences whether regional government formations are responsive to regional election results.

In addition, there are several reasons to expect that electoral accountability might be obfuscated: as regional government formations follow consociational norms in many regions, numerous regions are dominated by a single party, and national parties can influence strategies of regional party branches. In this paper, we explore the link between regional election results and regional government alternations. We study all the regional governments that were been formed in almost 3.000 regional elections in 294 regions, in 15 Western European countries. The results indicate that how regional electoral democracy is organized strongly influences whether regional government formations are responsive to regional election results.

Voters may wonder about the degree to which a particular policy failure can be blamed on the minister occupying the portfolio overseeing the policy area and the degree to which the cabinet bears responsibility. The same questions can be asked about coalition cabinets in presidential systems. The study of accountability in presidential systems has generally focused on the president and has not asked whether the president’s cabinet parties are seen to share in her responsibility. While the president's status may make her a more obvious target, voters may also hold the president's coalition partners accountable. We examine whether voters hold presidential cabinets accountable and, if so, whether voters primarily hold the president’s party responsible or whether the responsibility is shared with members of the president’s coalition. We then examine whether institutional factors affect the clarity of responsibility in presidential cabinets, in particular, whether greater presidential powers concentrate responsibility in the office of the president.

Even when politicians have no control over aid, they can claim credit for the aid under low information environments, thus undermining their other efforts to provide public goods. I test these predictions using Kenya's Constituencies Development Fund (CDF), which provides an ideal opportunity to measure legislators’ efforts since I can attribute CDF spending patterns directly to politicians. I examine two dimensions of these efforts: how much CDF they spent and how quickly they implemented their projects. Contrary to existing predictions, aid is not associated with how much CDF politicians spend. However, without political competition, I find that a 40\% increase in aid is associated with a one-half-a-month delay in the median duration of CDF projects--an effect that disappears in competitive races. I provide a game-theoretic account for why aid windfalls may delay but not diminish local public goods.

Making use of attitudinal data and objective indicators of goods and services from both Afrobarometer surveys and Demographic and Health Surveys, we demonstrate clear evidence of PBCs for a variety of development outcomes across SSA. This includes subjective assessments of living conditions as well as various objective measures of poverty based on asset ownership and access to goods and services. These findings hold across both data sources and are robust to a variety of specifications. Moreover, differentiating between outcomes we find that PBCs are less likely for gridded goods, the provision of which is harder to manipulate. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the link between electoral competition and development outcomes in Africa and elsewhere.

We have little understanding of the conditions under which elected officials will allow or oppose foreign influences on their elections. Furthermore, when countries do attempt to deter foreign influences on their elections, we do not have a systematic account of the strategies they use and why. In recent years, countries have taken actions that range from passing new laws against foreign donations to parties and candidates to diplomatic retaliation for meddling attempts. This paper theorizes variation in anti-meddling policies as being best explained by the different types of international threats that countries face as well as their different domestic political environments. It then tests the observable implications of the theory using new survey evidence as well as case studies of debates surrounding anti-meddling policies in several democracies.

Research shows that incumbents are primary perpetrators of election violence. Building on this insight, the paper tries to disentangle the forms of violence used by the incumbent to manipulate elections. I present a novel theory and evidence on the diverse strategies of violence used by incumbents, by documenting the use of both extreme and subtle forms of election violence. The argument is that competitiveness is a decisive factor in determining the escalation of violence during local elections. I explore my theory using the Indian state of West Bengal because it has held competitive and extremely violent elections since 1970. This paper uses mixed methods to test the logic of incumbent dominated violence and its implications for establishing electoral control. I test my expectations with novel data on 3,000 local electoral units. I combine this with original data on violence from local elections. I complement this with interviews from political actors. Preliminary findings indicate that violence is used to systematically demobilize opponents. Further, intimidation is widespread in incumbent controlled units. These findings have important implications for decentralization, and subnational authoritarianism research.

The Impact of Political Constraints on Counterterrorism	Countering terrorists through violence is common, as otherwise would be costly for governments. Nevertheless, we occasionally observe that governments taking this cost by adopting non-violent strategies such as engaging in peace talks. Hence, under what circumstances leaders choose non-violent measures rather than violent ones? This study empirically investigates the role of two domestic political constraints in leaders’ decision-making, namely regime institutions and leader experience. We argue that inexperienced leaders tend to use violence, while experienced ones may adopt conciliatory tactics, as the former are more risk prone to prove their strong leadership in their short tenure. However, we also contend that institutional mechanisms could moderate this effect depending on the level of constraints they impose. Drawing on a dataset on governments’ counterterrorism policies, we find that longer leader tenure increases the use of non-violent counterterrorism policies conditional on democratization level as well as government system (i.e., presidential vs. parliamentarism) of a country. Our findings contribute to the conflict studies by revealing the impact of leader and organizational-level factors on counterterrorism strategies.

We explain when and why political parties in democracies use violence as an electoral strategy. Integrating interpretive and instrumentalist accounts, we argue that politicians use violence for one of two aims vis-à-vis the audience; to coerce those targeted with violence, or to mobilize those sympathetic to the perpetrators. While violence may have both effects at once, we argue that politicians tend to prioritize one over the other, with each type having distinct implications for the actors, targets, geography, and cleavages of violence. Incumbents use violence primarily coercively, targeting the opposition in areas where it is expanding its control. In contrast, opposition parties use violence to mobilize electoral support, targeting competitive and demographically diverse districts in which cleavages can be sharpened through violence. We find support for the empirical implications of our argument in India. Our analysis relies on novel micro-level data on election results and political violence for more than 90,000 polling booths. We complement these data with qualitative content analysis of campaign speeches.

Conventional wisdom suggests that multilateral sanctions are often favored for their perceived legitimacy, both domestic and international, as well as their heightened coerciveness. However, these may also come with trade-offs with regards to the scope and severity of the measures the sender is able pursue.

Nonetheless, leaders’ ability to make such a connection depends on whether they can successfully manipulate information about culpability for economic shocks. Therefore, the extent to which leaders can control the information environment determines whether a shock leads to more aggressive foreign policy. I use survey experiments and cross-national analysis to test my arguments. Survey experiments fielded on the American public and a unique sample of U.S. foreign policy analysts show that the information environment systematically shapes elites’ expectations about leaders’ political behavior, public perceptions of leader competence, and public preferences over foreign policy. Moreover, a cross-national analysis based on observational data demonstrates that an economic shock tends to increase foreign policy hawkishness if the shock is more foreign-related or if the public has more limited access to a potential opposition voice.

What explains variation in immigrants’ integration choices? Seminal theories argue that military service is a critical driver of assimilation, but efforts to study this relationship face a self-selection problem: namely, immigrants who are better assimilated may be more likely to join the military in the first place. We address the selection problem by examining the effects of US military conscription during the Vietnam War using an instrumental variables approach. Conscription during the crucial years 1970–1972 was decided on the basis of national draft lotteries, which assigned draft numbers based on an individual’s date of birth. We use the draft lottery to instrument for military service and estimate the causal effect of service on a range of integration outcomes using granular data from the 2000 decennial census. Our study thus contributes novel evidence to key debates on the implications of military service for assimilation and national identification, while also highlighting a potential role for public policy to encourage immigrant incorporation via national service.

I make a distinction between migrants with the active or latent backing of the state (``settlers'') and migrants without that political resource (``strangers''). Settlers are associated with sustained nativist backlash, possibly escalating to anti-state violence and/or separatist war. Other forms of migration may inspire nativist mobilization but it will be more limited in scope and is less likely to take an anti-state turn. In fact, nativism is self-limiting in these circumstances precisely because government incumbents readily accommodate nativist demands.This paper draws on new cross-national data to simultaneously gauge the impact of settler and stranger migration on nativist conflict. This is the first such exercise to incorporate domestic and international migration into a single analysis of political violence. A case study of Bolivia is an instance of alignment between migrants and the state shifting over time. I trace how those shifts escalated and deescalated nativist violence and policy.

Host community responses to refugees in Uganda	Every year, a large and increasing number of people across the world are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. Despite knowledge that a refugee means someone who is involuntarily displaced due to a myriad of factors (conflict, climate, economy, politics), some actors have used this as an excuse to call for more restrictive immigration policies and an area for anti-migrant mobilisation. This, in turn, is overwhelmingly seen in regions that are hosts to a minority of all forcibly displaced. In this paper, I investigate the Ugandan case to understand when refugee arrivals and presence can call for unrest-related activities among the host population, and when it does not. Uganda is a country with liberal refugee-hosting policies where refugees are hosted in settlements instead of enclosed camps, which implies interaction between refugees and locals on a day-to-day basis. Using process tracing, I unpack potential causal mechanisms that take place. Under what conditions does the arrival and presence of refugees trigger social unrest?

The implementation gap between de jure and de facto can be large. Nevertheless, previous studies have relied on de jure refugee policy data, and have used binary or aggregated coding, which does not reflect the complex reality on the ground. Moreover, strategic laissez-faire policies which in practice grant more rights to some refugee groups than others, as it is the case in Morocco or Tunisia, have often not been considered in large-scale refugee policy data. Using new de facto refugee policy data building on earlier efforts, this paper examines the effect of different de facto refugee rights on refugee-related violence. We show that where refugees have de jure rights, but do not have these in practice, the likelihood for refugee-related violence is heightened. Thus, policymakers need to make sure that refugee rights are indeed put into practice to not only guarantee their existence, but also to prevent violence.

I fix upon the legacy of repression implemented to suppress the cultural practices of certain population by examining the systematic attack on religion during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I argue that religious repression suppresses religiosity and group identity of the victimized population, while that effect is conditional on prior demographic and social structures. When religion is tied to group identity, religious repression reinforces in-group identity. On the contrary, in regions where religion enjoys higher privilege, religious repression opens a window of social mobility for disadvantaged groups and shifts the victimized population away from their original identities. Using Chinese county gazetteers to collect data on county-level severity of religious repression in the CR and a difference-in-differences design, I expect that exposure to religious repression leads to weaker religiosity and stronger regime support, especially in counties where religious institutions possess more land before CR. This research facilitates scholars' understanding of the varying legacy of group-based repression from an overlooked niche.

While the primary goal for governments is to restrict movement and thus increase their military advantage, curfews are an indiscriminate and disruptive tool with negative effects on the social and economic life of civilians. Despite their extensive use, we have a limited understanding of their impact. We leverage the closeness of two national elections in Turkey and the concurrent implementation of curfews with novel data in a difference-in-differences analysis to examine their effects on voting and violence. Our results show that curfews decrease support for the ruling party but increase support for the Kurdish and Turkish nationalist opposition parties. They also appear to increase the number of rebel attacks in the areas they are implemented. This paper sheds light on the backlash effects of indiscriminatory practices and contributes to the literature on government measures to control civilian populations during conflict.

In this paper, I identify three plausible reasons why democracies take recourse to the law to increase their coercive powers. First, as a socialized act of democratic norms and liberal ideals that believe in the rule of law. The belief that laws matter means that legal legitimacy is required to enact coercion within a state’s boundaries. Second, as a means of upholding their commitments to international human rights laws. Unlawful repression could trigger backlash from an international audience. Third, as a shield to sustain their democratic credentials while being able to use force with impunity. Laws can serve as a signal of a deliberative democratic process even if the content of the laws are undemocratic. I leverage unique archival data on India’s counterinsurgency law to test these mechanisms. Specifically, the ministerial files on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and the parliamentary debates around them. Through process tracing, I find strong evidence for centralizing and increasing the repressive power of the state while not wanting to appear overtly authoritarian.

Traditionally, scholars have examined state violence against civilians through the nexus of repression and dissent, while more recent work examines certain violence in the lens of oppression and agency loss. I build on our understanding of political violence, arguing that along with dynamics surrounding agents, societal hierarchies can motivate state principals into preferring abuses of marginalized populations as well. I examine the state principal impetus across three dimensions: constituent connections and support, maintenance of privilege, and dissonance with liberal institutions. I theorize that factors in each dimension can impact state preferences for violence against marginalized groups, and entrench the core source of violence against marginalized peoples – societal hierarchies. To examine violence against marginalized peoples, I utilize the victim-identification typology of The Ill-Treatment and Torture Dataset (ITT) (Conrad, Haglund and Moore 2013) in conjunction with the human rights abuse allegations of the Sub-National Analysis of Repression Project (Cordell et al. 2021) to build an allegation level dataset that includes the identification of victims of human rights abuse victims.

I seek to contribute to this burgeoning research agenda by proposing and testing a theory which argues that the structural implications of socioeconomic and political gender gaps drive the nature of terrorist attacks. I propose a panel analysis of the use of sexual and gender-based as well as indiscriminate violence among terrorist groups, analyzing the ways in which gender inequality shapes the utilization of specific facets of political violence.

I point to the role of mass warfare in establishing restrictions on women's labor. Mass warfare is commonly theorized as a watershed moment for women entering the labor market to replace male labor. Contrary to this popular account, I argue that cash-strapped governments seek to economically reintegrate (male) veterans by pushing women out of their wartime occupations. I attribute this policy to government's fiscal constraints which make compensation policies for veterans' military service costly. As a result, demobilization reverses the progress women attain in wartime. I investigate this claim in the context of post-WW1 Great Britain, with a focus on sex-specific protective labor legislation. Leveraging differential levels of compensation for able-bodied and disabled veterans, I show that discriminatory labor practices were reinstated where veterans were less compensated by the state. I amend a growing literature that sees warfare as a driver of welfare policies.

Research has demonstrated that conflict affected societies are at risk of heightened levels of violence against women post-conflict as violence shifts from the ‘theatre of war’ into the home. This is often explained by the normalisation of violence. We ask if such learned behaviour transforms into a shift in attitudes that is still visible after decades - and if these attitudes are passed on to following generations. Combining newly updated Rwandan gacaca court records with three waves of DHS survey data, we show that individuals who live in areas with higher levels of genocide violence are more likely to perceive wife beating as justified. Furthermore, the negative impact of the genocide appears to span generations as we find similar effects for survivors‘ children. Our study contributes to research on the lasting legacies of conflict and underscores that these effects may be transmitted across generations.

Evidence From Israel	In violent conflicts, can shifts in forward-looking expectations about resolution change the public’s ideological willingness to compromise? Or do ideological positions shape such expectations instead? This question reflects a broader, and unsettled, scholarly debate about the causal direction between prospective beliefs and partisan preferences. However, it has not been studied closely in violent contexts, where it is particularly consequential. In the paper, we disentangle this endogenous relationship empirically using rich survey data on Israeli-Jewish attitudes regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Leveraging aggregate monthly series spanning two decades and two historical moments with exogenous shocks to expectations, we find that changes in forward-looking beliefs do shift ideological preferences for compromise, including across partisan camps. We do not find evidence for the opposite causal relationship. The findings contribute to our understanding of the interrelations between prospective expectations and ideological preferences and carry important implications for conflict resolution strategies.

Ukraine proved to be extremely resilient, but for a successful defence, the country urgently needs the support of its Western allies. As Ukraine is not part of any formalised defence alliance, the constant generation of attention through the media as well as the conveyance of the feeling in the Western partner countries that they are fighting for the right cause are crucial. This paper examines the question of what influence media coverage has on the willingness of national governments to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle. It compares media coverage in Germany and the UK as well as the actions of the national governments of both countries. Methodologically, the study uses a corpus-analytical procedure that evaluates the core statements of important newspaper media as well as the statements of government politicians over a period of several months before and after the start of the war. At the end, a statement on the influence of media discourse on government policy is to be made.

How Democratic Values and Security Threats Affect US Support for Foreign Military Assistance	US security assistance frequently flows to the militaries of abusive autocratic governments. While officials typically justify these relationships on the basis of security interests such as terrorism threats, human rights organizations contest them by arguing that they implicate the United States in severe violations of human rights. This paper reports results from an experiment administered on three surveys to test how these competing concerns shape American public opinion toward security assistance policies. Though the results demonstrate a preference for democratic partners with good human rights records, this preference weakens when terrorism threats become salient. This pattern is concentrated among respondents with an internationalist foreign policy orientation, suggesting that foreign policy elites, who typically hold internationalist views, may be particularly likely to abandon their commitment to pro-democracy policies in the shadow of security threats. The study contributes to understanding of when and for whom democracy and human rights are more likely to shape preferences regarding foreign aid.

However, little is known about how reneging on international deals and agreements affects public attitude in a country that has been subject to the other party's defection. We conduct a sentiment analysis of Persian Twitter before and after the United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known as the Iran deal, to explore how reneging on the nuclear deal affected the Iranian public attitude toward nuclear weapons. Our analysis is based on a list of Iranian Twitter influencers inside and outside of the country and includes more than 10 million tweets. Our findings show the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal has substantially increased public support for nuclear weapons acquisition. We also conduct a subgroup analysis to understand whose attitudes shifted more radically. The results show conservatives' and reformists’ attitudes shifted more radically in favor of nuclear weapons. On the contrary, radical anti-government individuals show the least level of attitude change in response to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.

Some scholarship suggests that as nations grow wealthier they spend more on arming—and thus a wealthier world will be a more heavily armed world. In contrast, others argue that prosperity leads to peace and thus should lower the incentives of nations to arm. A critical first step in answering this question is to estimate what a nation’s baseline level of military spending will be given the size of its economy and the level of threat it faces. Surprisingly, no existing scholarship has established this baseline. Thus, we have no theoretical or empirically guided prediction regarding how much a state will spend on arming. We expect that even as states grow wealthier and spend a smaller share of their wealth on guns, they still tend to spend more in absolute terms than in the past. This suggests that while a more prosperous world may be a more peaceful, it is also likely to be a more heavily armed world in which states have ever greater power to hurt one another.

Violent “spoiling” by armed groups opposed to ending a civil war is often seen as a key threat to the successful implementation of peace agreements. This is a particularly acute problem when armed groups have been excluded from peace agreements, as they may have incentives to derail the peace process. While it is not always possible to include every armed group within a particular peace agreement, there are numerous ways to manage potential spoilers and minimise the damage they can do. This can include various “carrot-and-stick” strategies such as military containment and political co-option. This paper draws on the new Dimensions of Demobilisation dataset to illustrate the effect of exclusivity on security following civil wars. It then examines how policymakers can successfully manage and contain potential spoilers to prevent violent escalation by drawing on examples from Bougainville and Timor-Leste.

While this is still the case for financial burden sharing, the recent literature shows that a large portion of personnel contributions come from privately motivated countries with weaker democratic traditions and poorer economies. One such incentive is the profits from standard reimbursements paid by the UN, thanks to low military wages and obsolete equipment. Interestingly, the literature provides contradictory evidence for the effect of troop contributions on civil-military relations in sending countries. While some suggest a coup-restraining effect, others argue that peacekeepers become more likely to attempt coups or mutinies. However, recent findings showed that this effect is context-specific, decreasing in anocracies, increasing in autocracies, and insignificant in democracies. This study aims to improve the existing accounts by providing new findings on this effect in investigating how non-democratic personalist regimes' participation in peace operations affects their civil-military relations at home by looking at the relationship between their troop deployments and coup-proofing practices.

Studies so far measured their effectiveness with the available conflict event data, focusing on whether aerial strikes lead to a decrease in insurgent violence. The intended purpose of aerial strikes is to support the troops on the ground and help to achieve their objectives, by securing their vicinities and pushing insurgents out of the area of interest. To evaluate their effects on the ground, we utilize novel datasets from the African Union (AU) peacekeeping forces on the operational movements of the peacekeepers, and the presence of Al Shabaab (AS) militants and activities in the context of Somalia for the year 2018. Results suggest that while aerial strikes may be effective in counter-insurgent operations, they may not be as effective as thought for defeating insurgents in the long term.

Whether rebel groups compete or cooperate has profound implications for conflict dynamics, the victimization of civilians, and the likelihood of reaching a peace agreement. Therefore, understanding whether and how inter-rebel cooperation can be externally induced is an important aspect of successful conflict management.To this end, we investigate the effect of peacekeeping deployments on inter-rebel fighting. We argue that the arrival of peacekeepers impose costs on rebel activity and shift power dynamics in favor of the government. This incentivizes rebel groups to re-evaluate the ideological and material costs of cooperating with each other and unite against their common adversaries. We test our argument using data on peacekeeping deployments and inter-rebel violence. We also show how peacekeeping deployment characteristics help to predict inter-rebel violence at the local level. Our findings contribute to the literature on civil war dynamics and peacekeeping effectiveness.

We argue that the arrival of peacekeepers impose costs on rebel activity and shift power dynamics in favor of the government. This incentivizes rebel groups to re-evaluate the ideological and material costs of cooperating with each other and unite against their common adversaries. We test our argument using data on peacekeeping deployments and inter-rebel violence. We also show how peacekeeping deployment characteristics help to predict inter-rebel violence at the local level. Our findings contribute to the literature on civil war dynamics and peacekeeping effectiveness.

Did deficiencies in government performance further erode trust in public institutions? Did citizens' ideology interfere with the way they processed information? To investigate both questions, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment in Spain in November 2020. Some respondents were provided information on the number of contact tracers in their region, a key policy under the control of regional governments. We find that individuals greatly over-estimate the number of contact tracers. When we provide the actual number, we find: a decline in trust in governments; a reduction on willingness to fund public institutions; and a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We also find an endogenous change in the attribution of responsibilities. In regions where the regional and central governments are ruled by different parties, sympathizers of the regional incumbent react by attributing greater responsibility to the central government (blame-shifting effect). In those regions, the negative information does not translate into lower voting intention for the regional incumbent, hindering political accountability.

Using multi-wave panel data collected by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP) over a two-year period from April 2020 to March 2022, we found a substantial amount of transitions in and out of conspiracy belief at the individual level. We modelled those transitions through a Mixture Markov Chain Model (MMCM) and identified two distinct clusters in the population: one more stable and the other more volatile. Our findings suggest that threat perceptions had complex and conditional effects, with health threats protecting against conspiracy belief and economic threats associated with transitions into conspiracy belief. Additionally, news on public broadcasters immunized the public against disinformation, while commercial news media and social media had the opposite effect. We conclude that the ‘infodemic’ was characterized by a battle of countervailing forces at work, with the nature of threats and media playing a key role in citizens' susceptibility to disinformation.

COVID-19 represents a cross-border shock that puts the capacity of national governments and the EU institutions to deal with the crisis to the test. Our empirical analysis relies on an Unexpected Events during Survey Design (UESD), which takes advantage of the UK vaccine rollout, when the first vaccine in the world was administered (8 December 2020). We use data from the Eurobarometer, combined with data on media reporting on the UK vaccine rollout, and show the effect of the shock on diffuse and specific support for the EU. Results illustrate that the news of the first vaccine dose reverberated in different EU countries, leading to a general increase in support for the EU, despite people became more reluctant on giving the EU more power on health decisions.

One in five workers in Germany earns wages below the threshold, and many remain stuck in poorly paid jobs. A recent labour demand shock induced through the government’s lockdown measures during the pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the determinants of mobility in the bottom wage segment. While previous research found that low-wage workers tend to underestimate their outside options, many permanently transitioned out of heavily affected typical low-wage industries, suggesting they may have found better jobs. Combining administrative with original survey data, this paper studies the extent to which opportunity perceptions and (im)mobility are driven by the composition of workers’ social networks. First, I map recent occupational mobility. I then investigate possible spillover effects where realised transitions out of affected sectors lead to further mobility of co-workers through increased visibility of labour market opportunities. A better understanding of occupational transitions is key to designing government interventions which reduce low-wage work through enhanced mobility.

Less attention has been given to factors in home countries that may affect migrants’ eventual circumstances. This study examines how the information labor migrants gain in their home countries while looking for overseas jobs affects their migration process and outcome. We conduct a field experiment in a high out-migration city in Pakistan where we provide objective and accurate information to respondents about modal job contracts and about the best-performing job recruiters in their neighborhoods. We find that this information does not have unconditional effects on aspiring migrants' experience of the migration process in their home country. However, it does have heterogeneous effects for low-information migrants who do not have contact with previous migrants and have not migrated before themselves. Together, our findings suggest that filling information gaps can lead to better outcomes for those who are not already well-connected and, therefore, do not have alternative sources of information to rely on.

Less attention has been given to factors in home countries that may affect migrants’ eventual circumstances. This study examines how the information labor migrants gain in their home countries while looking for overseas jobs affects their migration process and outcome. We conduct a field experiment in a high out-migration city in Pakistan where we provide objective and accurate information to respondents about modal job contracts and about the best-performing job recruiters in their neighborhoods. We find that this information does not have unconditional effects on aspiring migrants' experience of the migration process in their home country. However, it does have heterogeneous effects for low-information migrants who do not have contact with previous migrants and have not migrated before themselves. Together, our findings suggest that filling information gaps can lead to better outcomes for those who are not already well-connected and, therefore, do not have alternative sources of information to rely on.

First, I document widespread misperceptions: even within such small, compact, and isolated communities where early marriage is widespread, while most people believe that others believe that early marriage is acceptable (i.e., perception of norm is conservative), the average rates of opposition to early marriage are extremely high (i.e., the norm is progressive). I formalize the relationship between norms' perceptions and speaking-up in an individual decision-making framework and show through a field-based survey experiment that receiving private information about the true rates of rejection of early marriage makes individuals more likely to speak up against the practice in a recorded message to be shared with the local politician or the local radio. Then, I use the generalized method of moments to estimate a parametric version of the model with my experimental data in order to parse out why this information works and differentiate between a theory of social learning and one of reputational concerns.

We begin by documenting concentration in global cobalt trade by analysing trade distributions by volume from two perspectives. First, we use the Hirschman-Herfindahl index to examine how annual import and export link weight distributions changed from 1988 to 2021. Second, we construct a global cobalt trade network and document the evolution of the cobalt trade network by volume using several measures of network centrality. We then show FDI from China to DRC led to an increase in cobalt ore exports from DRC to China and has allowed China to effectively control the global cobalt market. Finally, we analyse empirical results through Realist and Liberal geoeconomics strategies, arguing that China`s ambitious `Going Out` approach has been the main determinant behind intense FDI policies, which is reflected in the global cobalt market leading to new energy security dynamics.

Advantages accrue to those with connections to the state or to those with privileged social status. The magnitude and location of where these factors precisely make an impact are less understood, however. In this paper, I locate precisely where leakages occur by causally estimating the impact of political and social determinants of access to private-sector development under unevenly enforced rule of law. I do so by implementing a field experiment in Senegal in which I create a registered business and randomize co-partisanship and gender during entrepreneurs’ applications for business permits at municipal councils. I find that co-partisan applicants deal with fewer steps in the application process and are more likely to successfully deposit their applications. Women are more likely to have their applications rejected, despite following the same procedures as men. By highlighting the specific areas along the institutional pathway where partisanship and gender are most influential, this paper offers causal evidence to inform policy to reduce the barriers facing entrepreneurs, particularly women, in developing countries.

Yet, most research focuses on the national-level effects of revolutions, such as military mobilization, political-institutional durability, or land redistribution. Unlike existing works, I focus on how revolutionaries foster individual behavioral shifts that align with revolutionary values. I argue that revolutionaries are more likely to change individuals' behaviors to align with revolutionary ideals the more they reinforce these values across local social, political, and economic institutions. The more officials infuse local institutions with revolutionary values, the more they limit individuals' access to alternative value systems while incentivizing behavioral conformity. I test this argument using subnational variation in the implementation of the Republican Calendar in France in 1793 to estimate post-revolutionary labor conflicts and strikes. The Republican Calendar was designed to support workers and shift the regulation of labor from spiritual authorities to secular ones ostensibly responsible to working people. Results support expectations: in places where officials more consistently reinforced the Calendar, workers were more likely to advance pro-worker positions through labor conflicts or strikes after revolution.

Italian Left-wing Terrorism during the Years of Lead	Are patterns of terrorism in democracy affected by dynamics of armed resistance in pre-democracy periods? In post-conflict democracies, most armed groups become political parties and institutionalize their organizational advantage through parliamentary and local democratic elections. However, memories of armed resistance can be reactivated when new generations experience socio-economic shocks that produce resentment toward the democratic regime, thus triggering violent political practices and terrorist attacks. Italy experienced a civil war in 1943-45, in which left-wing bands constituted the bulk of the armed resistance movement and long wave of terrorist attacks in the 1970s and 1980s (the so-called “Years of Lead”) with left-wing groups as the main actors. Is there any connection between the two phenomena? We have created an original dataset that includes more than 8,000 political events and violent attacks in Italy between 1969-1988 at the subnational level. We find that the local experience of armed resistance in areas with major social-economic shocks for young generations, depending on the local strength of the communist party, predicts political violence at the provincial by left-wing terrorism violence during the Years of Lead.

We explore this question in Italy, a country whose democratic institutions were forged in a civil war between an armed resistance movement against Nazi and Fascist forces. We argue that the local presence of resistance bands left anti-Nazi/Fascist legacies that shape political attitudes and behaviors today. We propose that these legacies are kept alive via a process of inter-generational, community-based transmission sustained on core mechanisms: (1) memorialization, (2) local anchors, and (3) local associational networks. We empirically explore this argument by exploiting novel data from a recent nationwide, grassroots mobilization campaign aimed at banning neo-fascist propaganda. We use an integrative multi-method research design that combines statistical analysis of all Italian municipalities to make sense of the campaign's spatial patterns, with a within-case analysis of a purposively selected locality to trace the process by which legacies are kept and transmitted across generations. Our study emphasizes armed resistance as a critical source of war's long-term political legacies and improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the collective transmission of political memories.

It is well known that wars kill and maim civilians years after violence ceases. However, why exactly this is the case remains poorly understood. Some long-term effects, such as unexploded ordnance, destroyed health infrastructure, are straightforward. I investigate a more indirect, but no less consequential effect: The deleterious effect of conflict on trust. Violence systematically reduces trust, an effect that can persist over several generations. At the same time, trust is an essential predictor of medical outcomes. Distrustful individuals are less likely to seek and follow medical advice, visit hospitals, and get their children vaccinated. By undermining trust, past violence continues to kill. To demonstrate this theory empirically, I combine over 1.5 million data points from various surveys, which I analyze using generalized difference-in-difference models. Exposure to violence is associated with significantly reduced levels of institutional trust, which predict lower vaccination, and, in turn, higher rates of under-5 child mortality. Despite progress made in accounting for the manifold indirect effects of violent conflicts, we might still be underestimating the true cost of war.

Yet, cooperative responses to climate change impacts are arguably more prevalent than violent outcomes and deserve equal attention. Furthermore, the framing of climate change as security threat is problematic as it has the potential to lead societies to prepare for future resource conflicts and induce zero-sum perceptions of resource access rather than seek and invest in peaceful, cooperative adaptation. We address and scrutinize these issues using unique panel survey data from approximately 1600 households residing in 36 villages along the 250 kilometers of the Jamuna River in Bangladesh – an area affected primarily by floods and riverbank erosion. We investigates cooperative and conflictive responses to a climate-related shock from flood and river erosion including both people who stay and those who migrate. We also include a survey experiment which primes respondents in this fragile context to see climate change impacts as a security threat or, alternatively, as a focal point for increasing cooperation and investigates respondents’ cooperative and conflict-related attitudes.

Given that these hazards affect millions of people worldwide and that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is paramount that we advance our understanding of what makes societies vulnerable to these hazards. Existing research has focused mainly on political violence as a consequence of natural hazards but has neglected the fact that conflict can also be an underlying factor that shapes the impact of these events. Consequently, we know little about whether and how exposure to violent armed conflict increases vulnerability to natural hazards. This article investigates the effect of armed conflict exposure on hazard impacts in the context of tropical cyclones. Combining data on the physical storm exposure with sub-national data on disaster impacts and conflict events allows for identifying the independent effect of conflict on hazard impacts. Results show that armed conflict events significantly increase the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards. Consequently, policymakers should consider conflict contexts when designing disaster risk reduction policies.

However, both international and domestic relief aid may be unevenly distributed across provinces, reducing some residents’ ability to recover in the wake of a disaster. We examine why disaster aid varies within countries, and we offer three explanations for this internal variation. First, we argue that the more closely that the central government works with international and nongovernmental organizations, the more likely that aid will be distributed equitably. Second, we examine the ethnic relationship between the central government and affected areas. We expect that regions with ethnic groups lacking representation in the central government may receive less post-disaster aid than areas with representation. Finally, we propose that existing interstate rivalries can limit international organizations’ ability to reach border regions, thus reducing the amount of relief aid these regions receive. We test our argument in Peru and Ecuador, two countries with a history of rivalry, ethnic representation, and varying relationships with the international organization community. We utilize new data collected by our Disasters, Migration, and Violence (DMV) Lab.

More frequent occurrences of storms, floods, and droughts are among the most adverse consequences of climate change. Especially when such hazards hit ill-prepared societies, devastation and hardship often follow. While numerous studies have examined a potential relationship between climate disasters and conflicts, riots and demonstrations have received little attention. This paper intends to fill this gap, by arguing that these are the events where actually an effect is most plausible. It further hypothesizes that this unrest-inducing effect should be most pronounced in rapidly growing urban agglomerations of the Global South, as infrastructure there has a hard time keeping up with the influx of people. Moreover, riots and demonstrations require spontaneous mass-scale mobilization, which is more feasible in urban areas. By drawing on a novel self-compiled dataset covering 26 Indian megacities over a 20-year period, this paper puts these hypotheses to empirical scrutiny. The results of spatial multi-level regression analysis yield that the likelihood of urban unrest is indeed higher in the months following climate disasters. Also, this effect grows stronger when cities recently have seen a spike in population growth.

Existing research suggests that natural disasters’ impact on macroeconomic performance, agricultural output, and livelihood makes people, including children, more likely to join rebel groups. We extend this argument, by presenting one additional mechanism that affects children’s engagement in armed groups. We argue that not only the supply side is affected by natural disasters, but also the demand side. In other words, not only children are more likely to join rebel groups after natural disasters but also rebel groups are more likely to recruit children. Rebel groups’ funding sources from natural resources are easily disrupted from natural disasters, hence they have more incentives to recruit children. The empirical results support our hypothesis that armed groups are more likely to recruit children after the hit of natural disasters. This research contributes to enlarge the discussion regarding natural disasters and urges to pay more attention on how environmental changes can affect humanitarian issues in conflict zones.

Studies looked at why and under which conditions governments make use of militias or companies both in war and peace times. However, little is known about if and how countries may strategically choose one option over the other, both simultaneously, or neither. I argue that pro-government militias and private military companies ultimately serve the same purpose for a government: battlefield support and security provision. I further argue that governments choose their options according to two primary factors: regime type and the structure of state security forces. I expect more democratic countries to prefer private military companies over pro-government militias. For autocracies, it depends on whether the state security forces are fragmented, i.e. whether a regime is coup-proofed as indicated by a larger number of counterweights, and on the duration of leadership. I test my expectations using data on internal armed conflicts, pro-government militias, private military companies, and state security forces. My findings contribute to the literature on state repression and non-state actors in civil wars.

Reconsidering the impact of conflict on coups and defections	In this paper, I propose a framework to describe coups and defections as complementary strategies that the military uses to increase its survival chances when facing a losing war and explain when conflicts trigger defections rather than coups. This framework lies on the consideration that when a losing war increases dissatisfaction among the military, they are likely to consider staging a coup an alluring option only if they believe that they have enough time to either change the course of the war or secure enough personal wealth before the regime fall. In turn, if they believe that the time left before the rebel victory is not sufficient to secure wealth or change the tide of the conflict, then they are likely to consider joining the enemy side as a better survival strategy. I test my argument via a cross-section time series analysis of conflict-affected countries between 1990 and 2016.

Existing research usually studies political and military defections separately and without regard for their potentially different motivations. I argue that patterns of defection are linked to the characteristics of political dissent. While it is well established that defections occur as the odds of regime collapse grow, I argue that they become widespread when dissidents employ strategies that signal their leniency toward both political and military defectors alike. This creates a dilemma that is exacerbated as campaigns progress and as regime elites become desperate to maintain power. The results of a cross-national quantitative analysis and a case study of Serbia's Bulldozer Revolution confirm my expectations. This study is one of the first to directly compare the logics of defection among a state's most trusted agents, and the results have implications for understanding popular uprisings, mass atrocities, elite cohesion, authoritarian politics, and for designing effective strategies of resistance.

Reconsidering the determinants of defections during conflict	In this paper, we pose that the less security armed forces are effective against the incumbent regime’s enemies, and the more the military has a central role in the government of the country, the more defections are likely. This is because tactical military effectiveness and military centrality jointly provide members of the armed forces with important signals regarding the likelihood of a defeat of the incumbent regime and the extent to which the members of the armed forces are going to be affected by regime fall. The rationale behind our argument is that military members are likely to see defections as powerful tools for dissociating themselves from a regime they consider to be on the verge of toppling and with which they fear being identified. To test our theoretical argument, we rely on a cross-section time-series multivariate analysis of 67 countries between 1990 and 2016. Results are in line with theoretical expectations and robust to different model specifications.

Theoretically, we expect autocratic leaders with parallel armed forces, such as pro-government militias, to outlive those without. Empirically, we first model the presence of militas across all types of regimes before analyzing their impact on leadership survival. Using novel data that identify whether a pro-government militia is directly connected to the leaders suggests that while irregular forces in general do not contribute to improved leadership tenure, personal auxiliary forces of the leader are able to help him stay in power. We further show that democracies and varying forms of autocracies recruit very different types of militias, but that most of them do not bolster leadership survival.

To examine the effect of recruitment methods on territorial control by rebel groups, we conduct a difference in difference model, whereby our treatment variable is forced recruitment practices. Empirically, we can observe two types of forced recruitment practices. The first is a hit and run tactic, where individuals get abducted by armed groups and then coerced to stay. The second type is more stationary, where armed groups take over villages, towns, or territories and establish themselves as new authorities and coerce locals to join the group either as combatants or slave labor. We expect that both practices have an initially positive effect on the spread of the rebel groups’ sphere of influence, because the latter type acquires new territory and the former marks dominance in a new region. For those group without treatment (voluntary recruitment practices), we expect the geographical spread to be contained, because newly recruited members often move towards the armed group and not visa-versa as with forced practices.

Provisions for the participation of former combatants in postconflict elections are cornerstones for successful and sustainable peace settlements. However, societies that have endured long-lasting civil unrest and armed conflict with the presence of rebel groups have a high probability of falling into a conflict trap, partly due to the state's inability to reintegrate former combatants into civilian life. Former combatants have difficulty reintegrating into society, often facing resentment and ostracism. Subsequently, this increases their chances of rejoining the armed struggle, particularly if other illegal armed organizations are readily available to welcome them. By conducting a survey experiment and elite interviews shortly before the 2019 and 2022 Colombian elections, I address the question of whether voters punish ex-rebels at the ballot box based on their rebel past. Preliminary results show that having a rebel past influences the potential support for a political candidate. Independent of the candidate's political platform and experience, voters seem to focus largely on past rebel affiliation, which appears to influence candidate perception and potential support.

Upon the receipt of demands, victims are expected to be released. Despite this, there remains large evidence of particularly egregious forms of hostage killing in civil war. Why, then, do some organizations choose to kill hostages? I argue organizations kill hostages as part of a punitive governance strategy in their areas of operation. When hostages are of no strategic value to the organization, hostage-taking and killing can be used as a corrective action to exercise control over the population. Hostage victims accused of acts which undermine the rebel regime are more likely to be killed than those taken for other purposes. I test the theory in the case of the Islamic State in Iraq with a multi-pronged empirical strategy. In doing so, I introduce new event-level data on hostage-taking and hostage killing in the 31 districts the organization governed between 2013 and 2018. The analysis provides robust support for the theory. The findings unveil important insights for policy and research.

Since 9/11, designating a rebel group as a terrorist has been a common strategy used by governments involved in civil conflicts to delegitimize a group. However, there is little evidence and argument on how delegitimizing a group affects the peace process in civil conflicts. We argue that contrary to the intuition that a government does not negotiate with a designated group, designation increases the likelihood that both a government and a rebel group have a negotiation. The “No negotiation with terrorists” principle tends to be considered as rejecting the room for peace negotiation with a rebel group, but a designation can be used as leverage for bargaining by a government. Employing a newly compiled dataset on terrorist designation and Peace Negotiation in Civil Conflicts (PNCC) dataset, we provide statistical evidence for our argument. The findings of this paper will contribute to a growing body of research on counterinsurgency and offer important policy implications for governments engaging in civil conflicts.

We argue that contrary to the intuition that a government does not negotiate with a designated group, designation increases the likelihood that both a government and a rebel group have a negotiation. The “No negotiation with terrorists” principle tends to be considered as rejecting the room for peace negotiation with a rebel group, but a designation can be used as leverage for bargaining by a government. Employing a newly compiled dataset on terrorist designation and Peace Negotiation in Civil Conflicts (PNCC) dataset, we provide statistical evidence for our argument. The findings of this paper will contribute to a growing body of research on counterinsurgency and offer important policy implications for governments engaging in civil conflicts.

However, this work centers on external state sponsorship while migration research studies diaspora as an actor in peace processes and development. This paper combines insights from migration and conflict research by examining diaspora as an external sponsor in state-based armed conflicts. In particular, I investigate the consequences of diaspora sponsorship to rebel organizations for civilians during intrastate conflicts. The paper builds on a principal-agent model in which co-ethnicity of a rebel and diaspora group is a key factor for support and compliance. Using unique data on financial and political diaspora support and existing data on state-based armed conflicts and ethnic one-sided violence, the paper conducts a large-N analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that diaspora support reduces likelihood of civilian targeting, specifically ethnic targeting. The paper generates an in-depth understanding of a diaspora’s agency as a non-state sponsor and offers further avenues for studying external sponsorship and civilian targeting.

But the form and extent of sanctioning differ substantially across cultures, with some providing strong prescriptions of retaliation and reputation building for individuals. Such cross-cultural differences in the role of individual retaliation have been documented using survey instruments and lab experiments, and previous literature suggests that they can explain a country's propensity to engage in warfare. Yet systematic real-life, observational data on this cross-cultural variation is scarce. This study documents such variation, analyzing data from three seasons of nine professional men's soccer leagues. Players from a cultural background that places higher value on revenge are more likely to retaliate a foul during a game. Players are found to be more retaliatory early in a game, consistent with the use of retaliation as a deterrent of future transgression. Retaliation is indeed found to limit repeated fouls by the perpetrator, but there is no evidence for broader reputational effects. These results provide unique evidence for cultural differences in establishing and maintaining cooperative equilibria.

An empirical assessment of group-think theory and the causes of inter-state war.	Does cabinet-homogeneity increase the probability of states initiating international conflict? The last decade has seen an increased interest in how leader-attributes such as military experience, education,and gender, have strong effects on their inclination to utilize military power. However, due to a lack of data there are few studies looking at the wider government and political elite. Assuming that certain experiences makes the head of state more hawkish, shared experiences within the cabinet may increase these effects. To measure groupthink at the highest level of government, we use a novel dataset, Paths to Power, which extends the WhoGov dataset and contains information on the educational, occupational, and social backgrounds of more than 30.000 cabinet ministers in 123 countries in the 1966- 2021 period. Based on this information, we create country-level indices measuring the educational, geographical, social and occupational diversity of the cabinet. These new measures allow us to empirically test whether groupthink at the highest level of government contributes to the emergence of inter-state conflict. Our results show that socially homogeneous cabinets are significantly more likely to intiate military conflict.

I further conduct heterogenous analysis by cohort, sex, and student's residency to explore potential mechanisms.

Answers to this question have hitherto focused on the effect of human rights compliance or strategic relations between countries. These existing approaches neglect the salience of power status and race in interstate human rights interactions: not only is human rights respect a criterion for """"""""good sovereignty"""""""", with non-compliance carrying material and social cost, the universality of human rights is also contested along racial lines, making interstate human rights interactions fertile ground for racialized status politics. Using data on recommendations made during the first and second UPR cycles and their severity, preliminary results suggest that despite theoretical grounds for suspecting obfuscated racial bias in interstate human rights interactions and international relations in general, there is little evidence of it in the UPR.

However, the experts are nominated by member states and elected through the campaigns of their own governments. The election process is also politicized, including vote trading and negotiations between countries. Some experts even call attention to the campaigning process being harmful to the value of impartiality. Given the political nature of the selection processes for treaty body members, we attempt to investigate the factors that influence states' decisions to send their people to international human rights institutions and hold campaigns for them. This paper offers an alternative point of view that human rights institutions promote human rights through the political and strategic goals of the government, not despite them, instead of holding on to the unrealistic claim that experts should be independent and impartial. We test this argument by examining the historical composition of the ten core human rights treaty bodies between 1965 and 2022.

Co-optation of elites becomes a tempting alternative. We examine this trade-off by studying the effects of elimination vis-.-vis survival of Polish elites during World War II. Our focus is on the Polish nobility, intellectuals, and (reserve) army officers. We exploit plausibly random variation in the officers’ wartime deployment and subsequent imprisonment. While most officers in Nazi captivity survived, almost all those in Soviet captivity were murdered. We find that municipalities with more surviving elites saw fewer protests against the postwar Soviet-backed regime during the Solidarność-led uprising in the 1980s. Historical evidence suggests that surviving elites positively influenced local-level economic development, thereby reducing economic hardship and grievances against the regime.

The costs of arming can be measured by existing data on national military expenditures, but it is more difficult to assess the costs of war. We develop a novel approach to estimating war costs, based on using case studies of the costs of particular wars to project total costs of other wars from data on battle deaths. We find that, in the last half-century at least, the global costs to human welfare of arming grossly exceed those of war. This suggests that the costs of arming deserve greater attention than they have so far received.

This paper examines this question by exploring whether dictators' efforts to control personnel via elite purges allow them to further expand their power by creating institutions loyal to the dictators. Using newly collected data on elite purges between 1980 and 2010 and matching methods, I provide the first systematic analysis of whether and how elite purges enable dictators to further promote the consolidation of power by creating puppet parties and paramilitary forces. The empirical results show that repeated purges targeting high-level non-security positions within the decision-making bodies, such as cabinets and ruling parties, increase the probability that leaders create new regime parties or paramilitary forces loyal to themselves. My findings suggest that the underlying mechanism in which elite purges promote the consolidation of power has less to do with diminishing elites' abilities to oust leaders via a coup. Rather, elite purges concentrate power in the dictator's hands by allowing him to control the decision-making processes and make unconstrained decisions.

However, a form of self-screening and selection out of security services had already started pre-transition. Secret police officers were trained to know the condition the state was in, observing and reporting on the “mood” in the society.

On the other hand, officers had conjectures about what aspects of their pasts might prevent them from being positively verified and may have refrained from verification altogether. Our formal model of auto-verification incorporates both kinds of considerations to understand their effects on the composition of the pool of security agents who remained in security services post transition. We test the model predictions using individual-level employment data from the Polish communist secret police, Służba Bezpieczeństwa.

Indeed, how to respond to irregular migration to Europe continues to be a central issue of debate in many countries. What drives migrants onto the Mediterranean, risking their lives in flimsy rubber boats? Drawing on novel monthly data capturing the number of attempted crossings by migrants’ country of origin for the period 2014 and 2019, we are able to systematically examine the drivers of the demand for rescue at sea. Our time-series--cross-sectional research design in combination with modern machine learning techniques allows us to disentangle push factors pertaining to the conditions in the migrants’ countries of origin from pull factors given by particular policies present in Europe or the capacity for Search and Rescue activities by Europeans.

We examine this question by focusing on how the election of a new US president affects migration intentions and plans in Central America. We exploit the overlapping of fieldwork dates for the 2020 Latinobarometro and the 2016 LAPOP surveys in Central America with the American presidential elections held in those years. We estimate the short-run effects of Trump’s and Biden’s victories on migration intentions by comparing respondents who were asked about whether they plan to emigrate either before or after the announcement of the election results. We combine this evidence with a survey vignette experiment in Honduras which asked respondents about their migration plans after being given a plausible scenario for the 2024 US presidential election: a Trump victory, a Biden victory, a generic Democrat victory or a generic Republican victory. Through both this quasi-experiment and the survey experiment, we explore the extent to which Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric reduces emigration intentions and how Biden’s perceived relative openness to immigration might increase emigration intentions.

I argue that receiving material reparations can increase political engagement among survivors of state violence. I examine this claim with content analysis of victim testimonies, qualitative interviews, and causal estimates that exploit exogenous variation in the timing of reparations addressing the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. I find that survivors of state violence who receive reparations are more likely to register to vote than those not yet compensated. To offer insight on the mechanisms linking compensation to increased political activity, I present evidence that the symbolic dimension of reparations payments is particularly valued by recipients who use this transitional justice experience to update their views about the state. These findings suggest that in post-violence contexts, policy experiences can be a consequential determinant of future political behavior. These results are important for societies implementing transitional justice policies in the hopes of expanding political engagement, achieving long-lasting peace, and preventing repeat violence.

To move towards reconciliation, all sides in a conflict need to engage with former foes and recognise responsibility for war crimes by in-group members. However, acknowledgement of in-group wrongdoing in interactions with an opposing side is costly in post-conflict contexts. Dissenters from ethnocentric narratives of violence that attribute criminal responsibility exclusively to the other side are punished by being stigmatized as traitors. How can an inter-ethnic dialogue with speakers addressing their side’s culpability be encouraged? Drawing on inter-group contact hypothesis, we test whether support from family and neighbours can challenge the silencing effect of dissenters’ stigmatisation. We conduct a survey experiment in Serbia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a dominant social norm proscribes acknowledgment of in-group’s war crimes in inter-group interactions. We find that both family and neighbours’ support increase willingness to acknowledge in-group wrongdoing in Serbia. However, in Kosovo, only family support increases willingness, while in Bosnia, only neighbours’ support has the same effect. The paper advances little understood determinants of willingness to have inter-ethnic contact and address wrongdoing needed for societies’ recovery from conflict.

While the conventional wisdom suggests that transitional justice policies address victim grievances and advance justice, the micro-foundations of these assertions have rarely been rigorously tested. To address this knowledge gap, we aurvey over 2,000 victims in Colombia and Argentina. We hypothesize that apologies and severe prison sentences will diminish anger and retributive desires while denials and lenient trial outcomes will have the opposite effects. When we present respondents with hypothetical transitional justice scenarios through a conjoint experiment, we find strong support for our expectations in both countries. However, after victims watch a randomly-selected real-world video capturing pivotal moments in transitional justice trials, responses often contradict our hypotheses. We argue that one reason we uncover a discrepancy between hypothetical and actual experiences is because transitional justice - and trials especially - provide three types of information: 1) about perpetrators' innocence or guilt; 2) about perpetrators' acceptance of responsibility; and 3) about the judicial system. In short, actual transitional justice experiences can reveal information that complicates legacies and perceptions of the past.

This examination of Northern Ireland is of particular importance because of its absence in the broader conflict management literatures. In a revealing gap, extant research on post-conflict societies has been largely limited to conflicts experienced in the global South, inadvertently itself perpetuating what we consider to be a necropolitical bias that overlooks the actions of some state governments.

We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between state-perpetrated one-sided violence and retributive post-conflict justice. We also find strong evidence to support the inclusion of NI in traditional conflict datasets and call for a reexamination of its exclusion from conflict studies and samples.

We hypothesize that personalistic leadership is a critical determinant of different autocracies’ options in facing the decision to cover-up or come clean. We will combine existing regime data with a novel dataset on compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including indicators on breach allegations, and regime responses to those allegations. With a series of time series cross-sectional regression models in a variety of specifications (including country, treaty and region-fixed effects) targeted at mitigating endogeneity concerns, we find that personalistic regimes are the most prone to treaty breaches and to concealment strategies, underlining the threat these regimes pose to the international order.

Collective Memory and Support for Military Intervention	When do pacifist voters support war? In this paper, we examine how framing military intervention in terms of historical legacies can have geographically heterogeneous effects on voting behavior. To do so, we analyze changes in support for the German Green Party following the party’s support of Germany’s first military intervention since World War II: the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the previously pacifist Green Party, explicitly invoked narratives of responsibility and genocide prevention in his endorsement of the intervention. Using municipality-level electoral results for the 1999 European and local elections, we examine the effects of historical legacies on changes in support for the Green Party following their abrupt adoption of an interventionist policy. To examine the effects of historical legacies on voting, we focus on variation in exposure to Holocaust commemoration, using fine-grained data on proximity to concentration camps and other forms of public commemoration. Our findings contribute to literatures on foreign policy preferences, the impact of historical legacies on political behavior, and the accountability of political parties.

However, these improvements have been neither linear over time nor stable across countries, and recently, there have been rollbacks in legislative protections for women’s rights in countries around the world. These reversals make it clear that a vital step in the process of realizing women’s rights is holding legislators accountable for their obligations under CEDAW. A necessary precondition to accountability is information—in this case, information about the actions that individual legislators take to realize (or not) women’s rights. Thus, in this project, I present an original approach to measuring legislators’ records with regards to multiple dimensions of these rights, using Bayesian models and data on votes, legislative speeches, and other public-facing activities. I apply this approach to one test country and explore its extension in other contexts.

This poses two major issues for assessing human rights performance. First, measuring economic and social rights fulfillment at only the national level masks significant subnational variation. For example, California produces consistently better health outcomes than Missouri. Similarly, many national metrics are not disaggregatable by sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Second, existing indicators rely on government reported data- these data are the result of political decisions and political outcomes. They are often not reported consistently or measured the same across governments- both within and across countries. In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, there were multiple instances of governments deliberately misleading or outright falsifying health data. I demonstrate a remedy to both these problems by administering a subnational expert survey on health outcomes, and provide pilot data that shows it is possible to measure fulfillment of ICESCR obligations with this method.

The coding process builds on an existing corpus of allegations from human rights reports. Each allegation sentence presents information about a specific type of physical integrity violation and may also contain information about the actor type. The information content of the allegations varies, and each allegation only contains information about a subset of these items. Therefore, the information for each allegation is based on a probability model that relates the text contained in each allegation to human coded categorical data of each item. The coding of each allegation sentence is quite costly in terms of human coding time. Our human identified allegation data covers a sample of countries: Angola, Belarus, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, and the United Kingdom for every odd year report between 1999 and 2016. We use this training data to code and evaluate each repression allegation for all countries in the world from 1999-2016 using a supervised machine learning approach.

Explaining the International Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (Non-)regime	Why is there no strong constraining regime on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)? AI induced weaponry has the potential to dramatically alter modern warfare and its impact on and beyond the battlefield is sometimes compared to that of nuclear weapons. As the most comprehensive international forum discussing potential regulatory approaches towards a certain AI application, the Group on Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (GGE) within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) is discussing the addition of a further protocol on LAWS. Yet so far, the group could only agree on a set of nonbinding guiding principles in 2019 and the talks have reached a stalemate since then. Theoretically, I draw on rationalist bargaining theory and develop an argument how misaligned preferences have shaped the high-level negotiations over LAWS regulation and lead to no agreement. I utilize spatial analysis to study the bargaining process. Furthermore, this article contributes to theoretical refinement on what factors impede successful regime formation. Empirically, this article provides the first systematic analysis of preference divergence within the context of the negotiations at the CCW.

History is replete with the failure of militaries that were slow to see the implications of technological change to the future battlefield. Yet, if navigating successful technological change with effective warfighting concepts is difficult at the national level, it can be well-nigh impossible when transformations must be achieved in the context of a multinational military Alliance comprised of states with diverging interests and different levels of military capability. Understanding this challenge requires one to open, what Paul Poast called, “the black box of capability aggregation” in alliances. This paper seeks to do this by comparing earlier NATO efforts to adopt a new warfighting concept with contemporary attempts to translate concepts like Integrated Deterrence, Multi-Domain Operations, and Joint All-Domain Operations. In the 1980s, NATO faced a similar challenge. The Soviet Union’s military build-up had given it a worrisome offensive capability, which NATO could only answer through nuclear escalation. NATO’s response was to turn to the promise of new technologies, like long range targeting, which could

Offensive wars encourage elite collective action by offering clear selective benefits. Based on their contributions, a defined set of elites can be promised cuts from the spoils of war. Moreover, the expected outcomes of war are relatively predictable, since an attacker can prepare to fight against a specific target. By contrast, defensive warfare could not generate collective action. First, it is hard to exclude non-contributing elites from the benefits of defensive warfare. Second, due to the large variability in potential enemies’ military capacities and tactics, it is difficult to assign responsibility for the outcomes of a defensive conflict. Finally, both the collective and selective benefits are heavily discounted, because it is uncertain when – if ever – an enemy will invade. Empirically, I will use difference-in-difference models to compare the effects of military victory for attackers and defenders in the inter-state wars of 19th century Latin America. To examine the theoretical mechanisms, this observational analysis will be accompanied by a lab experiment.

Combining insights from the onshore border-interstate conflict and the maritime conflict literatures, I argue that offshore oil deposits that are closer in proximity to shared maritime borders provide increased incentives for states to engage in revisionist behavior and attempt to claim the offshore oil for their own use. The distinctive nature of maritime borders and offshore oil resources further exacerbates revisionist incentives due to increased tangible salience, offshore oil potentially spanning both sides of the border, and having fewer institutional options to help mediate maritime oil conflict. Using GIS software and PRIO-Grid data, I develop novel measures for proximity of offshore oil to maritime borders, but I find mixed support for the theory. Only dyad-years that have offshore oil deposits between twenty-five and fifty nautical miles have an increased risk of maritime diplomatic conflict onset. The results indicate that more nuanced offshore oil data is needed as well as providing a fruitful direction for future maritime resource conflict research.

How do verbal clues by third parties impact the strategies of the parties in an intrastate conflict? Although third-party interventions have been studied extensively, the verbal clues by third parties on civil conflicts have been overlooked since verbal indications are perceived as cheap signals. However, statements can serve as effective tools and the strategies and tactics of parties in an intrastate conflict can change with foreign support signaled through the leader’s statements. Based on the importance of verbal indications by third parties on intervention, this study will introduce a new measure, and examine how leader statements impact the course of events in civil conflicts. This study particularly focuses on how the statements of the US and Germany impacted both the state and non-state actor behaviors in the armed struggle of Turkey with PKK between 2010-2019. The study reveals that highly resolved signals by the external states particularly change the actions of the non-state actor. Findings contribute to the third-party intervention literature since the introduction of this new variable measures the perception of third parties in a more nuanced way.

Few studies, however, consider the explanation with a gender focus. In light of this, this paper examines whether female engagement could affect the risks of protest violence and event escalation. I argue that violence is more likely to break out in social movements that lack female engagement as society expects women to always remain calm and peaceful. Such social expectations are so strong that when females break the norm, the social sanction on them will be harsh. Given that adopting violent tactics for women is more likely to face severe backlash, they are more likely to remain more peaceful. Empirical analyses of social movements in Africa and the case of 2019 -2020 Liberian protests support my expectations. Overall, this paper shows that female participation is vital to sustaining peace in civil resistance campaigns.

Many observers expected the Covid-19 pandemic to increase conflict, especially in Africa. Conflict in Africa indeed increased by up to 60% in 2020 compared to 2019. Theoretically, the pandemic represents a –prolonged– external shock in a conventional escalation model and we assume that the pandemic will have a moderate, but significant conflict-enhancing effect, which will materialize depending on pre-pandemic fragility, the nature of the pandemic, government responses, and regarding conflict type. Methodologically, we identify a causal effect by exploiting differences in weekly conflict levels per country before and after the first infections employing a two ways fixed effects model. We find a small causal effect for all conflicts. Longer-term effects are investigated by regression analysis integrating all relevant variables of our theoretical model. Results confirm a small but significant effect. However, classical drivers of conflict are more important. Relative to pandemic severity, countries with more democracy, less corruption, more stable ethnic relations, stricter and faster responses experience less conflict. Pandemic-related violence materializes through repressive government responses (“Covid-19 unrest”) and economic hardships that fuel pre-existing power struggles, often with ethno-regional overtones.

On predicting changes in conflict-induced migration.	Political violence in a location is a significant factor accelerating out-migration. Nonetheless, the number of people migrating varies between and within conflicts over space and time. Studies show that the perpetrator and the spread of violence can partly explain these variations. However, additional research is required to test more specific assumptions on how and when different types of violence and their compound effects within and surrounding a specific location affect the dynamics of conflict-induced migration over time. This paper defines the variation in out-migration as phases, differentiating between periods with low and high levels of displacement to explore how temporal and spatial transformations of the various violence predictors affect the transition to a new phase of escalation. The paper draws on geo-referenced event data from the UCDP. For the outcome, geographically and temporally scattered data from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) at the district level for 17 African countries between 2008 and 2018 are combined by training on a subset of countries and evaluating predictions into the future within the same country and for the same period across countries.

We examine research suggesting that party-based regimes are more resilient due to higher levels of cooptation. Based on cooptation strategies specific to party-based regimes, we examine the claim that such regimes are better able to accommodate diverse interests and thus prevent key political players from organizing dissent. In line with literature on authoritarian stability and empirical evidence from individual case studies, we expect fewer anti-government protests in party-based regimes and that organized interest groups are less likely to actively engage in these protests compared to other types of autocracies. We test our hypotheses using original data on organized interest and the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database from 2003-2010. Our negative binomial models show that party-based regimes are not associated with a lower number of anti-government protests, nor with the prevalence of actively organized interest groups. This unexpected result is supported by several robustness checks. The finding challenges the widely recognized assumption that using ostensibly democratic institutions for cooptation effectively prevents mass uprisings, a key threat to autocratic regime survival.

However, questions regarding the ideology of an armed movement, the organisation's behaviour, the relationship with civil society, the commitment of each rebel group to the set of ideas they proclaim and how each movement understands the conflict and its end are still challenging. This research analyses how we observed differences in ideology in rebel groups with a shared background in multi-actor civil wars and how that influenced the patterns of violence those groups use. The hypothesis proposed is that it is a micro-level variation in an ideology based on the interaction between the conflict framing, the conflict goal, and the normative commitments of each group in a multi-actor civil war under a logit of competition. Through qualitative data analysis using Colombia's case in a comparative historical analysis, this paper provides a set of hypotheses and presents new research questions about ideology and the use of violence in rebel groups.

Do repressive institutions substitute for culture and influence cultural repression after institutions are dissolved? I argue that in a two-group society, the dominant group becomes reliant on repressive institutions over time which atrophies group norms and reduces collective, norm-related violence after institutions change. I test this argument in the US South, arguing that the white population became reliant on slavery to ensure their dominance over time. I develop measures for the degree of local cultural evolution using questions about descent from the 1880 full-count census and create a novel approach using naming patterns to capture white group norms. I find a negative relationship between the duration of cultural evolution and lynchings. The proposed mechanism, group norms, is supported by less co-ordination of white naming patterns and less difference between white and black names, measured with machine learning classifiers, in places with longer cultural evolution. These findings offer nuance to understanding how violence originates, how cultural and institutional discrimination interact, and challenge priors that different forms of repression will reproduce in similar ways.

Do extreme weather events impact environmental policy decisions? Extreme weather events have been shown to impact environmental concern and voting behavior in a wide range of countries and contexts. There is however less evidence of their impact on policy decisions. In this paper, we look at the impact of extreme weather events on environmental spending by Italian municipalities. Extreme weather often has very localized impacts, and fiscal policy is a key tool that can be used by local administrations to respond. We combine high-resolution data on weather conditions made available by Copernicus and geolocated data on natural disasters in the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with detailed data on public spending by Italian municipalities made available by the OpenBDAP service. We test whether extreme weather events have an impact on the amount of resources that municipalities allocate to environmental protection. We hypothesize that the political orientation of local governments is an important mediator of this effect, with left-wing local administrations being more likely to increase environmental spending in the wake of extreme weather events.

More precisely, I exploit the 1999 Ecological Tax Reform in Germany to study how rural areas react to higher taxation on liquid fuel in times of high gasoline prices. Introducing a new measure, called isolation risk, I find that areas that are both rural and lacking public transports are more likely to vote parties that oppose fuel taxation. I argue that the mechanism explaining this effect is the lack of substitute goods and the inelastic demand for private transports for residents of these areas: they cannot resort to public transports nor do without motored vehicles. Using both electoral data and individual-level survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I show that the the Ecological Tax Reform contributed to a loss of support for the SPD, while benefiting the FDP and the Left. I also show that these changes are due to the mobilization of political competition against fuel taxation rather than changes in attitudes towards the environment per se.

Recent work has challenged this common interpretation, both focusing on the policy realities and public opinion data. In this paper I argue that climate change mitigation is commonly understood by citizens as a collective action problem, both across countries but also within country. I present the results of two survey experiments that show how willingness to incur in costs to contribute to mitigation is increasing with other people’s and countries effort. The pattern is similar both at the individual and the country level.

Recent research demonstrates that agreeableness is an important determinant of publicly expressed political attitudes in autocracies. Still unclear, however, is whether agreeable authoritarians’ regime support is sincere, or whether agreeable people are more likely to falsely report supporting the regime in order to maintain a positive relationship with others. To date no studies have empirically examined how agreeable authoritarians' regime support may change as they strive to maintain a positive relationship with others. This is a significant gap: Whether agreeable authoritarians are insincere or sincere in their expressed regime preferences has important implications for understanding how support for seemingly popular authoritarians appears at times to evaporate overnight. Using observational and experimental evidence from Russia this study will advance our understanding of why some citizens falsify their preferences and shed light on how autocrats’ popular support can rapidly dissolve. Even more broadly, it will also contribute to our understanding of the sources of compliance and conversion in the face of social pressures.

Although a growing body of work has calculated the returns to public office worldwide, we know comparatively little about how the drive towards financial self-enrichment affects that way politicians carry out their official responsibilities. This paper develops a simple theoretical framework and analyzes new data on corrupt gains among high-level legislators to estimate the governing costs of corruption. Using unique measures of hidden assets and earnings based on the financial disclosures of Russian State Duma deputies, I find that corrupt deputies are less active and more obedient members of parliament. Even controlling for party affiliation, deputies that prioritize personal profit motives in office overall exert less effort on legislative activity, and when called to vote, align their behavior with the ruling regime’s political agenda. Moreover, corrupt deputies are also much less likely to win re-election, suggesting party leaders may reserve and then rotate designated spaces for corrupt politicians in key institutions. Taken together, this paper provides some of the first micro-level evidence of how authoritarian institutions are used to co-opt elites.

In autocracies, malfeasance frequently serves as a spark for discontent. As a result, authoritarian leaders often attempt to portray corruption in a neutral or positive light: these are merely a few bad apples, whom the regime is evidently finding success in rooting out. When does the public view corrupt officials as emblematic of a rotten regime and when do they see them as isolated cases of an imperfect regime doing its best to clean house? In this paper, I examine the effects of officials in an authoritarian regime being legally punished for corruption on public opinion. I compile a dataset of millions of public opinion survey responses regarding regime approval in Putin-era Russia from 2003-2020 and combine this with extensive region-level data on the arrest, prosecution, and jailing of officials. Together with a difference-in-differences design, this allows me to identify the effects of the discovery of corruption in an authoritarian regime on the public’s attitudes.

By holding open the possibility that a demanded reform can be achieved through institutional channels, authorities can create uncertainty about whether more radical actions are necessary. This reduces the incentives for contentious collective action and enables authorities to avoid having to resolve difficult conflicts in the meantime. I explore the predictions of the model using original archival data on the processing and outcome of over 4,000 community petitions for land redistribution in 20th-century Mexico (1915–1991). I show that bureaucratic delay often succeeded in defusing agrarian conflicts, that this strategy was more common when and where the costs of redistribution increased, and that villages with a longer history of collective action were better able to secure policy concessions quickly. The data illustrate the importance of local politics and bureaucracy in determining the course of the reform and the way in which bureaucratic delay—alongside repression and redistribution—played a role in sustaining one-party rule.

Using ship registers of indentured emigrants to the British colony of Natal, constituency-level electoral returns, and district-level economic and political controls, we find that districts that sent more migrants, witnessed more competitive elections—higher turnout and tighter races. We argue that emigration altered local ethnic dynamics in the Indian districts leading to more competitive elections. Exposure to life in the colonies led to greater political consciousness amongst low caste migrants against the caste system, making them more likely to fight the social and economic dominance of upper castes back home. We rank the subcastes of individual migrants using the social rankings of castes in the census of 1901. We show that districts that sent more intermediate castes relative to their share in the population were associated with increased competition. Intermediate castes were historically socially marginalized, and key beneficiaries of the franchise expansion. Our results are robust to using the 1923 elections.

Despite the Black Sea slave trade's massive scale and distinctive features --- most notably the noncooperation of native elites and the relatively strong capacity of raided states --- little is known about its consequences for socioeconomic development. Analyzing the first comprehensive dataset on Tatar raids using difference-in-differences and instrumental variables strategies, we find that more intensely raided areas initially experienced a decline in population and urbanization, yet went on to not only recover but achieve higher levels of development from the 18th century onward. Our findings caution against generalizing conclusions about slavery's socioeconomic consequences from the Atlantic slave trade, suggesting that cooperation with native elites and the strength of preexisting state capacity play a key role in conditioning such effects.

We argue that governments, which are constrained either institutionally or by public opinion to create regulatory relief, will resort to alternative compensatory policy for regulated firms. Here, we show that the United States Export-Import (EXIM) bank, which was established to support U.S. firms abroad, can serve such a role. Empirically, we find a robust correlation among the largest U.S. Fortune~500 firms between EXIM bank loans and firms' voluntary emissions reporting behavior. These results are consistent with our interpretation that firms use carbon emissions disclosure as a costly information revelation mechanism to credibly signal their vulnerability to carbon regulation to governments. Our findings resonate with concerns that firms can find ways to evade (environmental) regulations such that local emission reductions in the U.S. are offset by increased emissions abroad.

In this paper, we examine the role of coordinated corporate political activity in the private equity playbook for managing and retooling portfolio company acquisitions. First, we assemble a unique dataset of leveraged buyouts of US companies from 2008-2019. Using a doubly robust difference-in-differences estimator, we show that portfolio companies acquired by private equity subsequently increase their federal lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions. These effects are particularly large for companies that had stayed out of politics before the acquisition as well as those acquired by politically active PE firms. We also find evidence that PE managers coordinate lobbying strategy among their portfolio companies to improve cost effectiveness and narrow advocacy goals. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the PE industry’s financial performance owes not just to the financial and operational engineering, but also an optimization of political strategy to increase firm value.

We argue that lobbying mainly aims to facilitate communication between a foreign country and the US and the incentives for foreign governments to lobby US policymakers depend on the concurrence of significant events and the types of diplomatic channels available. We show that foreign government lobbying expenditures increase when elections take place in foreign countries during US ambassadorial vacancies. We also show that when US ambassadors are political apointees, lobbying expenditures to hire commercial lobbying firms decrease, but this effect is weakened under divided governmemnt in the US. Our results suggest that foreign lobbying can facilitate intergovernmental communication by reducing informational asymmetries when conventional bureaucratic and diplomatic channels are weakened.

Estimating the Determinants of Entrepreneurial Intentions in Tunisia and Senegal.	While entrepreneurship is an oft-studied topic, most scholarship implicitly assumes that financial acumen and personal traits matter the most to successful entrepreneurs. However, we know that in countries where access to government institutions are elite-biased and where rule of law is selectively enforced, risk-taking and innovation may matter less than connections to influential politicians and officials. To better understand how elite bias in institutions may shape who becomes an entrepreneur, we conducted online panel surveys of college-educated young people in Tunisia and Senegal containing a conjoint experiment assessing who, in respondents' minds, would make a successful entrepreneur. We subsequently implemented field experiments recruiting from these panels that randomly offered entrepreneurship training combined with meetings with government officials who specialize in business-related regulation. Our survey evidence reveals that respondents believe connections to ruling parties and to government officials strongly influence the possibility of success in starting a business. Our preliminary results from field experiments suggest that these biases can be at least partially overcome by building positive relationships with local government officials.

Although inter-country differences among welfare states in the region have received attention, housing as “the wobbly pillar of the welfare state” (Torgersen 1987) remains a field where such differences remain undertheorised and often explained solely by different policy choices made in the past few decades. Based on data encompassing developments in housing tenure and housing legislation of the 100 years, the research finds that some differences in the countries’ housing tenure structures and housing policies are rooted in policy choices made decades before state socialism was introduced in the region. The paper argues that different positions of (predecessor) states in the world economy, their housing legislation and the ideological basis of their housing policies in the first half of the twentieth century when housing policy was established are factors that have had an impact on the tenure structure and housing policies of CEE countries during and after state socialism.

Why have governments constructed so little new public housing? In this paper, we argue that local politicians build less public housing because they face electoral backlash. We compile a novel dataset of all new housing constructed in Germany between 1996 and 2011 from the full-count housing census and combine it with data on municipal elections. We demonstrate that incumbents lose around four percentage-points when new public housing is constructed between elections, with left-wing parties as the main losers. We then provide evidence of potential mechanisms, including the role of property values and NIMBYism; perceptions of public housing being associated with low-income and immigrant groups; and fiscal dynamics. Our findings provide a new explanation for why public housing is underprovided and have implications for the construction of new public housing when electoral incentives for local politicians are misaligned.

Discouragement and political action	Are we underestimating the political power of renters? I argue that as increasingly more people rent, this will fundamentally change how citizens and governments interact. Available research predominantly uses renters as the reference category for homeowners when analyzing political effects of ownership - but what about non-ownership? This paper analyzes the effect of an exogenous variation of interest rate hikes on access to homeownership. Increasing mortgage costs reduce trust in government as well as economic optimism for those individuals that are directly affected by a rising unaffordability of homeownership - the most typical form of private insurance - as citizens perceive the state’s failure to deliver access to this form of private insurance. By conducting a survey experiment in Germany and the UK, I evaluate the argument that as mortgages become more expensive, the experience of having been priced out of the market will translate into a higher willingness to take political action.

Housing affordability and rising rents have triggered political demands for more public housing, rent controls, and even expropriation. A salient target of this backlash are institutional investors who have been buying up urban real estate and are seen as drivers of price hikes. We argue that this political backlash is not only about narrow economic self-interest such as rising rents and house prices; it reflects a fundamental rejection of “financialized capitalism” that turns housing as a shelter into a financial asset. To substantiate our argument, we first analyze the successful housing expropriation referendum held in Berlin in 2021 to examine how socio-economic and political characteristics of neighborhoods shape precinct-level referendum support. Second, we complement this analysis with original survey experimental data, demonstrating that discontent with financialized housing markets rather than mere price increases explains support for expropriation. Our findings imply that financialized capitalism can unify voters across traditional class and political cleavages and push them toward extreme policy demands.

This ambivalence is especially puzzling in Latin America, where demand for progressive taxation has been persistently low following the return to democracy despite endemic inequality. Many scholars argue that this is due to low expectations of reciprocity, or the expectation of receiving state goods in exchange for taxation. We challenge this literature, as it makes strong assumptions about how individuals naturally make the trade-off between that the state ‘gives’ in benefits and what it ‘gets’ from tax revenue. We examine fiscal preferences using original conjoint experiments from Colombia and Mexico, which represent a closely controlled comparison between states with similar welfare provision and tax burdens but differ markedly in their tax structures. We then present an original, pre-registered survey experiment in Brazil, which indicates that considerations of benefits and the overall tax burden do not increase preferences for progressivity without an explicit linkage between taxation and welfare benefits.

Using an original online survey experiment spanning eight countries and 12,000 respondents across Latin America, one of the most unequal regions in the world, we find significant evidence for an under-explored explanation: misconceptions regarding the distributional effects of current tax policy. Treated respondents who are informed that an increase in the Value-Added Tax (VAT) is regressive are significantly more likely to prefer policy reforms that make the tax more progressive. Treatment effects are driven by the large fraction of respondents who underestimate the regressivity of the VAT,even though their misperceptions are linked to fundamental views about the world. These respondents are disproportionately right-leaning and more likely to attribute success to individual effort than luck.

Using an original online survey experiment spanning eight countries and 12,000 respondents across Latin America, one of the most unequal regions in the world, we find significant evidence for an under-explored explanation: misconceptions regarding the distributional effects of current tax policy. Treated respondents who are informed that an increase in the Value-Added Tax (VAT) is regressive are significantly more likely to prefer policy reforms that make the tax more progressive. Treatment effects are driven by the large fraction of respondents who underestimate the regressivity of the VAT,even though their misperceptions are linked to fundamental views about the world. These respondents are disproportionately right-leaning and more likely to attribute success to individual effort than luck. Despite the deep-rooted nature of their misperceptions, treatment effects are largest among individuals who hold these views of the world. These findings contribute both to understanding the political economy of redistribution and the potential for information interventions to shift support for fiscal adjustment policies protecting the most vulnerable.

The Roles of Fiscal Risk, Time Discounting, and Risk Preferences.	Does realizing future benefits from redistribution increase support for the social security system? Based on the extant literature examining the relationship between people's future risk and preferences for redistribution, we hypothesize that realizing their own welfare benefits from government policies regardless of socioeconomic positions, such as current/future benefits from medical insurance, may increase support for redistribution; this effect, however, may cancel when people know their government fiscal unsustainability. To test them, we conduct an online survey experiment that randomly provides information that emphasizes the benefit of social security programs. The treatment group receives the correct amount of benefits an elderly receives from the medical insurance system. The treatment group is divided into sub-groups along whether to provide the information about their government’s fiscal unsustainability. On average, these treatments have no influence on their support for tax increase for medical insurance. Nevertheless, dividing the sample into those who are aware/unaware of the government fiscal risk, we confirm our hypothesis for the unaware respondents. Moreover, we found the heterogeneity of the treatment effects depending on time and risk preferences.

How individuals react to the philanthropy of the rich. 	Philanthropy is one of the main characteristics that define the super-rich today. Some of the wealthiest individuals in the planet, like Zuckerberg and Bezos, have recently pledged to give away most of their assets. Although there is a growing literature about taxing the rich, the impact of the philanthropic behaviour of the rich on individuals’ preferences for taxing them has received very little attention. The aim of this paper is to come up with a theory about how the philanthropy of the rich can reduce individuals’ willingness to tax them. I argue that citizens might reward the rich for their giving for two different reasons: (i) for contributing to the common good through their donations and (ii) for signalling through their donations that they care about their community and that they are prosocial and generous. To test these theoretical expectations, I design a survey experiment where I provide individuals with information about the philanthropy of the rich.

In this study, I argue that tax enforcement can strengthen pro-social norms and thus lead to changes in individual preferences and behaviors. I leverage three cases to test my argument. In the Italian and Slovakian contexts, I show that local enforcement leads to greater revealed preferences for social spending. As the horizontal equity of the municipal taxation increases, individuals reveal increased intrinsic demand for local social spending, electing more frequently to redirect 0.5% of their income tax from the national budget to social service expenditure in their municipality. This pattern illustrates how government action influences individual values, and that a better-functioning taxation system supports a more progressive society. In an additional case in Australia, I show that tax enforcement before a single-issue national election led to voting against the party championing a regressive tax reform. My evidence suggests that, across contexts, the horizontal fairness of the tax system contributes to pro-social norms.

It expects argues that risk exposure only increases welfare demand when it is reasonable to assume that workers are aware of their risk exposure and when future-related concerns are currently salient. An empirical analysis of longitudinal data from Switzerland and 28 European countries supports the theory. Swiss workers only optimize their welfare preferences in a forward-looking manner when they become unemployed, and only the national unemployment rate is found to increase welfare demand in European countries. In contrast, a variety of risks on the occupational and individual level drawn from previous research are found to be unrelated with welfare preferences. The implication is that the risk exposure of employed workers may matter less for their welfare preferences and downstream political phenomena such as voting behavior than commonly expected.

I propose an argument whereby there is an extent to which people perceive differences in incomes between themselves and those poorer as justified, because they simultaneously reflect and confirm their own relative social status -- especially in a context of salient ethno-cultural heterogeneity due to immigration. This may then lead to willingness to sacrifice parts of ones' own material pay-offs to reduce those of the competition even more, i.e. be less supportive of redistribution. I test the implications of the argument using a 2x2 vignette survey experiment, where respondents were randomly allocated to either no vignette; information about their position in the income distribution relative to those poorer; information highlighting recent increases in immigration; or both of these two combined. In accordance with the theoretical expectations, the results suggest that exposure to the *combined* vignettes lead to lower expressed support for redistribution, especially among the lowest and the highest imcomes.

And when are people more divided over it? Previous studies have focused on the effects of income inequality, economic development and individuals’ household income, but mostly separately and with some mixed results. This article theorises and tests the interactive effects of these three factors. First, support for redistribution is proposed to increase when both development and inequality are high. While inequality increases the need for redistributive policies due to self-interest, development enhances people’s altruism by providing resources and state-capacity required for redistribution. Second, public opinion is expected to be more divided when both inequality and development are low. In these cases, the costs of redistribution go to a broader segment of the population and involve a larger share of their income. The analyses use multilevel models to estimate over-time effects with survey data consisting of 368,619 respondents in 281 surveys from 86 countries over three decades. The results support the hypotheses, showing that support for redistribution is higher in developed unequal countries, and that the differences are largest in less affluent equal countries.

In this paper, we examine whether citizens' moral attitudes toward private debt influence their preferences toward public debt policy. Given that private debt often invokes strong moral emotions rooted in religious beliefs, we argue that many people rely on their attitudes toward personal debt to evaluate the complicated macroeconomics of public debt policies. Using both observational and experimental survey data from Italy and Brazil (N=3000), we show that people's moral judgments about private debt repayment are strongly correlated with their attitudes towards public debt consolidation and repayment, even after controlling for other important factors. Additionally, we demonstrate that experimentally manipulating people's beliefs about whether defaulting on private debt is morally """"""""right"""""""" or """"""""wrong"""""""" also changes their attitudes towards public debt policy. Our research sheds light on the role of moral emotions in shaping public opinion on economic policy.

Meeting Fiscal Needs in Zambia 2002-2020	How do politicians in sub-Saharan Africa achieve fiscal sustainability? Legislators can borrow externally or attempt domestic revenue mobilization. Much of the literature suggests that legislators are “chameleons” shifting rhetoric once in power to conform to clientelistic pressures, and adjust their spending and taxation with an eye to winning elections. To test these propositions, this paper draws on 16 years of Zambian parliamentary debate, comparing legislators’ rhetoric toward three sources of government finance: corporate taxes, payroll taxes, and external credit. We use dynamic word embeddings to compare rhetoric when politicians are and out of office, showing that preferences are strongly constrained by the fear of financial crisis, limiting the degree to which legislators can pursue any one of these strategies independently. Our paper contributes a new dataset including over 400,000 parliamentary speeches with covariates for legislator district, gender, and occupation. It also adds to the literature on policy autonomy in developing countries, demonstrating the conditions under which politicians attempt domestic revenue mobilization.

First, it uses qualitative and quantitative text analysis methods to study changes in parliamentary discourse related to poverty in the aforementioned time period. It studies prime ministerial speeches, question-answer sessions, and public speeches. Preliminary results suggest that there has been a change in the perception of poverty over time: while it was conceptualized as a problem to be solved through economic growth, employment and the provision of adequate foodgrains to people in the 1960s and1970s, this perception expanded to focus on rural development and investment in health and education as facets that were as important as economic growth and employment to address poverty in the early 2000s. Second, it conducts a similar text analysis using budgetary speeches, which contain information related to budgetary allocations and justifications, to find that a change in the perception of poverty in political discourse is strongly correlated with a change budget allocations and justifications. This provides insight into the policymaking process in India.

This information shock allows us to study the causal effect of misalignment on political speechmaking. We find that MPs who learn that they represent principals with incongruent preferences (leave vs remain) significantly reduce their tendency to speak about the EU and Brexit, compared to MPs with congruent principals. Instead, they talk more about populist topics, such as crime and justice, and ‘the people’. They also cater more to their districts by speaking more about local issues and housing development.

For some groups, these classifications are more contentious. The deservingness heuristic also structures politicians’ response to policy design: considerations of benefits are expressed about deserving groups, whereas punitive measures are important for undeserving groups. The analysis is based on a field survey of over 500 elected representatives in Germany in 2021. Legislators judge the power and deservingness of six groups – asylum seekers, elderly, drug addicts, farmers, handicapped persons, investment bankers and unemployed – and then describe their policy choices on a subset of these groups in an open-ended interview. We leverage model based clustering for classifying assessments of power and deservingness and then use these classifiers for analyzing open-ended survey responses about policy design. The paper offers novel evidence on the power and privilege of some groups over others. These group differences are rooted in the variegated perceptions of elected representatives.

Information about policy implementation and its consequences has been theorized to be a determinant of who has a policymaking advantage: Congress or the bureaucracy. Given the critical role of information, what drives information sharing between bureaucrats and Congress?

Using a new dataset that covers the federal agency affiliation, appointment type, and agency-level characteristics of each bureaucrat who testified in Congress from 1961-2018, as well as a new measure of analytical information present in witness testimonies, we examine who from the bureaucracy testifies in hearings and what information they provide. We find that the presence of divided government dominates as the main driver of the information exchange between bureaucrats and Congress.

Employing multiple new statistical methods appropriate for the staggered introduction of reform legislation, our results show that reelection rates significantly increase following the abolition of patronage appointments. We then show that one reason for the increase in reelection rates comes from increases in rates of rerunning by incumbents.

In this paper, we offer the first cross-country experimental study on how different types of potential citizen candidates value and trade off costs and benefits of public office, and how this influences the quality of the candidate pool. First, we conduct a conjoint survey experiment across 10 developed and developing economies (N= 15 000), during which we elicit individual preferences for national disclosure regulation and lobby rules. Second, using a factorial experiment, we randomly vary hypothetical local office rules and study their effects on the desire of respondents to run for local office, and differentiate between socially and rent-seeking motivated candidates. Our findings have important implications for the research on political selection and transparency.

We discuss why we expect benevolent dictators to be rare, empirically. We also detail observable implications, and especially how we can distinguish “benevolent dictators” from other types of authoritarian leaders who, in some contexts, have incentives to act similarly to benevolent dictators. Our subsequent empirical analysis, drawing on several thousand heads of state or government since 1789, suggests that there have been very few benevolent dictators throughout modern history. The lack of consistency in “good performance” across policy areas and over extended periods of time, for almost all autocratic leaders, is hard to square with “benevolent dictatorship”. Finally, we discuss academic and policy implications from our argument and findings, stressing the importance of making realistic assessments about autocrats' motivations and how this influences our ability to form more precise expectations about dictators’ future behavior.

The president offers favors like bribes, state advertising revenues, and low tax rate to the rich media owners and takes in return skewed media coverage that increases his popularity and assists him in winning the elections. A system like this emerges, on the initiative of the president, when his popularity is low to ensure his political survival. A forward-looking popular president refrains from this decision, since the favor exchange system would constitute a powerful tool in the hands of his political opponent in future elections, when the former will hold the opposition role.

Cross-section results reveal that each additional electoral turnover elevates support for democracy, leading to a positive cumulative impact over one’s life cycle. We then leverage close elections and discontinuities around the voting age to identify the unique causal effect of turnovers and test the mechanism behind this effect.

During these years the Presidents of theUnited States developed a strong rhetoric against drug abuse. The main target ofthe presidential rhetoric was crack cocaine, a drug that the media associated withBlacks. We implement a difference in differences approach to test if exposure to the presidential rhetoric affected the behavior of law enforcement officers. We find that arrests for crack cocaine of Blacks increased more in counties more exposed to the presidential rhetoric against drug abuse, while we find no effect for Whites. We use machine learning techniques to construct a novel measure of the intensity of the presidential rhetoric against drug abuse, based on Regan's and Bush sr.'s public papers. We then use this new measure to validate the findings of our DD model. We find that Regan’s political rallies had a similar effect.

This study argues that corruption is a causal determinant of political assassinations. Politicians use assassinations as a way of enforcing their corrupt agreements with other politicians. To test this argument, I develop a novel dataset on political assassinations in Brazil. More specifically, I identify the universe of all assassinated municipal politicians by linking data on over 10 million homicides over the past two decades to a registry of all political candidates. Using these data, I exploit randomized anti-corruption audits, which have been shown to reduce subsequent corruption in audited municipalities. Consistent with the theory, I find that politicians are less likely to be assassinated in audited municipalities, and these effects are amplified when larger government revenues render it more worthwhile to engage in this form of costly punishment. These findings suggest that beyond various other consequences, corruption may foster political violence, with important consequences for democracy and development.

Evidence from Italian Municipal Elections	Studies have highlighted an increase in attacks against elected officials. However, little is known about the motives of these attacks, whether they are perpetrated by individuals or organized groups, and which politicians are most likely to be their victims. This paper asks whether women pay a higher penalty than their male colleagues.

While previous studies focused on the provision of public services with clear links to political and state actors, the present paper examines the closure of bank branches in Spain, a public-private service not directly provided by the government. These closures decreased financial accessibility in many rural and periurban areas. Moreover, by facilitating the privatization of the banking industry and injecting public money to rescue banks, this process bred protests throughout Spain, where mainstream parties are perceived as the main political actors responsible for this phenomenon. Preliminary results from DiD models show that bank branch closures fostered anti-mainstream party vote, mainly for 2011-2015, characterized by widespread protests and an ongoing fragmentation of the party system. Simultaneously, the closure of bank branches does not seem to affect voting turnout, even in the long term. The findings help us understand the links between the privatization processes taking place under globalization and their effects on changing electoral landscapes.

The dramatic rise in import competition from developing countries since the 1990s has given new urgency to explain political responses in the United States and other advanced economies. Recent scholarship has cataloged many reduced-form effects of trade shocks. Far less attention has been paid to the problem of unbundling the causal paths through which economic shocks affects political responses. In this paper, we assess the possibility that an important part of the political effect works through local labor unions that shape the relative strength of workers in the policymaking process. We study the US House of Representatives using a recently developed semi-parametric mediation model. The model operates by leveraging two distinct sources of exogenous variation: an instrument for import competition and a novel instrument for district-level union membership based on history and geography. We find that import competition lowers district-level unionization and that weaker unions lead to less legislative responsiveness. The union channel represents a large fraction of the treatment effect of import exposure on legislative votes.

Past generations of workers joined together for mutual aid and political agitation to address such grievances. But precarious employment, fissuring workplaces, and distributed supply chains make it harder to build the necessary occupational identities and dense networks of co-workers. How will workers and firms respond? I exploit a widespread but largely unstudied set of firm-specific, employer-driven income support programs, ``employee hardship funds'' (EHFs). Echoing mutual aid funds from an earlier era, EHFs raise money in the form of donations from workers themselves and provides cash grants to a firm’s own workers when they face unforeseen emergencies. I document the prevalence of EHFs, including among 9 of the 10 largest American retailers. I use a novel matched worker-employer survey at two large firms to discover whether such privately provided """"""""welfare"""""""" matters to workers, improves financial well-being, and affects workplace solidarity and politically relevant attitudes: support for unions and for the welfare state.

Even though it is growing rapidly, it still accounts for only 1-3% of employment across Europe. Consequently, it is valid to ask why parties should develop a policy position on this economic niche topic. The paper aims to analyse: (1) if the gig economy is taken up by the entire ideological party spectrum; (2) in which countries it does (not) play a role in party competition; and (3) which argumentative strategies different parties/party families use. Therefore, classical theories of party competition are combined with the niche issue literature to investigate whether argumentative patterns from previous niche issues can be transferred to the gig economy. The article draws on the parties’ most recent manifestos to perform quantitative text analyses. The sample comprises all parties from more than 20 European countries with at least one seat in the national parliament. Preliminary findings show that the gig economy is addressed in about 30% of manifestos, that parties from the entire ideological spectrum engage in the discussion and that national contexts matter.

Focusing on unionization, we argue that misperceptions about the benefits and costs of unionization prevent workers from taking action. In a representative study, we show that there are many Americans who have misperceptions about the material consequences of unionization and that there is a relationship between holding misperceptions and support for unions. Using a survey experiment, we correct workers’ misperceptions about the costs and benefits of unions and test whether doing so increases support for unionization. The results indicate that correcting misperceptions leads to a large increase in support for unions. We find that these effects run through a direct and indirect mechanism. First, voters update their priors about what unions could do for them and therefore support them more. Second, voters update their priors about the capabilities they and others like them have to improve their own working conditions (political efficacy), leading to increased support. Our study helps us understand aggregate support for unions in advanced democracies.

Over the last two decades, we have seen an important restructuring of employment relationships in post-industrial societies, and technological change is widely considered one of the main drivers of these transformations. The emerging literature in political economy has shown that exposure to automation makes individuals more likely to support radical right parties. However, the extant works have not yet identified the mechanisms linking exposure to automation and political behavior. In this paper, I explore the potential mechanisms, focusing on the interplay between economic and cultural factors. Using mediation analysis and survey data from the European Social Survey (2012-2016) for thirteen European countries, I present evidence that outgroup threat and nostalgic sentiments mediate the effects of technological change on support for radical right parties and political disengagement. I then complement the analysis with a survey experiment with a parallel design encouragement applied in the US. My findings have important implications for understanding the links between structural change in labor markets, cultural backlash, and political inequality.

Do training policies prevent that workers are being left behind during the transition towards the knowledge economy?	An important characteristic of the knowledge society is routine-biased technological change which has deepened the divide between routine workers and college graduates. Given the decline of traditional labour market institutions, such as labour unions, the idea that inclusive access to training policies can prevent that these routine workers (“the losers of technological change”) are being left behind has become popular among academics and policy makers alike. However, little is known on whether these skill strategies achieve their goal of making technological change and therefore the transition to the knowledge economy more inclusive. Therefore, I ask the following question: Can life-long learning policies moderate the impact of technological change on employment opportunities of routine workers? I use a novel identification strategy for public training infrastructure by exploiting data on the geographical distribution of training providers in Denmark which I match with employment data from the Danish registers. This enables me to study whether in firms, which have better local access to training providers, routine workers are less likely to experience downward mobility.

An analysis of the employers' contribution to the rise of far-right parties based on linked employer-employee data.	It is a well-established finding that technological change has caused frustration among negatively affected workers and therefore contributed to the political success of far-right parties. However, workers within the same occupation experience technological change differently depending on how firms manage technological change. Understanding the firm as an actor with agency opens the possibility that despite occupational status losses at a national level, inclusive production strategies can prevent that workers feel left-behind in their existing employment relationships. This suggests that firms have a role to play in shaping the extent to which job polarisation because of technological change ultimately leads to political polarisation which would be novel contribution to the existing literature. Therefore, I ask the following question: Can firm-level production strategies moderate the effect of working in occupations negatively affected by technological change on far-right voting? To test the argument, I analyse a linked employer-employee version of the German SOEP panel study which provides data the inclusiveness of firm-level production strategies. I further use the well-established routine task intensity index to operationalise technological change at the occupational level.

In this paper, we argue that the automation risk also affects individuals' environmental concern and subsequent policy support. The long-term economic risk posed by automation is expected to reduce environmental concern amongst those affected, due to a deprioritisation of long-term issues that also necessitate economic transformation. Automation risk subsequently leads to individuals being less concerned about the environment and less supportive of costly environmental policy. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) from 2002 to 2018 for 23 European countries, we find individuals more exposed to technological change are less likely to hold environmental concerns. Moreover, using causal mediation analysis with data from the eight wave of the ESS, we explore how exposure to automation affect support for environmental policies.

Local politicians that belong to the incumbent’s coalition will spend relatively more than politicians that are partisan-unaligned with the government. I test the theory by leveraging the Peruvian political crises between 2017 and 2020 using a rich, monthly dataset on district municipalities’ spending. I apply a difference-in-differences design that uses the constitutional fact that election cycles of local mayors are independent of national election cycles. I find that municipalities, where mayors share the same party affiliation as the President, spend 11% more during political crises, especially on discretionary budget lines. This finding would suggest that, even in contexts with weak parties, important cross-level political dynamics can lead to inefficient spending decisions.

This is a substantively important question without an easy answer. It is difficult to make inferences using observational data, as often done in the literature. Most important, firms with managers personally connected to political elites also tend to be state-owned enterprises (SOEs), i.e., institutionally connected to the state, so it is hard to tell which type of connection matters. This study addresses the inferential challenge through a simple conjoint survey experiment with Chinese loan officers. I find (1), contrary to the conventional wisdom, local SOEs in China do not have any institutional advantage vis-à-vis private firms in accessing cheaper bank loan, but the advantage kicks in when the state tightens credit control; (2) the advantage gets bigger monotonically as the strength of the institutional connection gets stronger; (3) firm managers’ personal political connections also matter independently; and finally, (4) political connections, whether personal or institutional, do not wash away the importance of firms’ economic fundamentals in accessing bank resources. This paper contributes to our understanding of the micro-foundations of economic resource allocation.

Building on previous studies, we hypothesize that gaps in the quality of public services and information asymmetry between the government and the population increase support, while exposure to information about the potential abuse of such tools by the state reduces support. We conducted a survey experiment with 2462 respondents in Russia and complemented it with four survey experiments of 1000 respondents each in Germany, Turkey, the United States and Estonia. We find strong and consistent evidence that knowledge about the potential misuse of digital governance solutions reduces support, irrespective of the type of political regime. Citizens who mostly rely on government-controlled information are more likely to support the introduction of digital governance tools. Contrary to previous studies, we do not find that gaps in the quality of public services increase support. Instead, respondents who are satisfied with the services provided by the state also seem to trust the government with introducing a digital governance solution.

It presents a stylized theoretical model that illustrates the conditions under which electoral consequences should occur. Based on the assumption that taxation is unpopular, it can be expected that governments are rewarded for tax cuts and punished for tax increases; and based on the assumption that taxes are popular among supports of pro-redistribution parties on the left, it can also be expected that left parties rather reap electoral rewards for tax hikes and suffer losses for tax cuts. These expectations are tested with data on the electoral fates of government parties in OECD countries over 45 years. The empirical analysis covers the development of personal income and VAT tax rates as well as the adoption of tax reforms in the legislature during government parties’ incumbencies. The results show that increases to personal income taxes is punished at the subsequent election, with some evidence also pointing towards electoral rewards following personal income tax and VAT decreases.

Yet, joining the government as a junior partner can be electorally costly. On average, due to their relative policy invisibility, junior coalition partners lose more votes than the prime minister's party. This is made worse when the economy performs well, as voters mainly credit the latter for economic boom. This suggests that junior partners are electorally disadvantaged under macroeconomic boom, as voters’ crediting of the prime minister’s party overshadow these parties’ policy accomplishments. This paper focuses on junior partners' electoral strategies under economic boom. I argue that under an improving economy, junior partners without responsibility for the finance portfolio should distinguish themselves from the prime minister's party. They should pay greater attention than the latter does on non-macroeconomic policy issues, i.e. attention differentiation, with the goal of maximizing voter support. Results from statistical analyses support my hypotheses and suggest that in a good economy, attention differentiation is electorally effective for junior partners. They also hint at the potential link between growth and issue diversity in elections.

Drawing on a survey experiment, we then evaluate the model using the proposed electoral reforms in Germany. We show that citizens become less supportive of the opposition and the opposition’s proposed electoral reform, when they are informed that the opposition is supportive of the reform. This pattern is consistent with citizens learning – from the attribution to the opposition party – that the reform is likely to be biased and punishing the politicians accordingly.

This paper proposes one mechanism that focuses on 19th century party building efforts in states with diverse societies and high-levels of voter disenfranchisement. I conceptualize a mechanism -- Associational Endowments, by which parties managed to create voter-party linkages in the absence of free and fair elections through civil associations. During the 19th and 20th century, emergent political parties organized outside parliaments in civil society; Socialist, Catholic, Protestant, ethnic, and agrarian parties, provided material (and non-material) goods and services to the disenfranchised population through their brick-and-mortar institutions. This paper shows (1) where associations where built during the long process of democratization, (2) what the associations did and for whom, and finally (3) the relationship between a party's Associational Endowment and the likelihood of it's survival into the democratic party system. To show evidence in support of the mechanism, I collected, digitized, and coded archival data for over 18,000 civil associations from the Hungarian Kingdom (1848-1945).

In every Italian election with a running Catholic party, two regions, separated by the Po river, showed marked differences in their Catholic votes (above 20 p.p.). They also voted differently in referenda on divorce and abortion (1974, 1981). I exploit the discontinuity generated by the river to disentangle the effects of conservative formal institutions (the theocratic Papal States), and conservative culture (Medieval patriarchal norms) on voting outcomes. For several centuries, the region north of the river displayed conservative culture but progressive institutions, while the other had a progressive culture and was only partially subject to conservative institutions. Using a novel Difference-in-Geographic Discontinuities (DIG) estimator, I find that conservative institutions have no effect on Catholic votes. The entire difference in votes is attributable to culture, through its effect on social capital.

Yet, existing literature does not provide a direct measurement of welfare support in the phase of development of the welfare state, and of how it could have been affected by immigration. In this article, we use results of Swiss referendum votes covering a hundred years of welfare expansion (1890-1992) to investigate the relationship between the percentage of immigrants and support for welfare expansion in the formative phase of the welfare state. Matching data on the percentage of immigrants at the subnational level with local referendum results on the expansion of different welfare programs (health, pensions, unemployment), we find no evidence that a higher proportion of immigrants is associated with lower levels of support for welfare expansion.

Through the practice of indirect rule, the British Empire relied on local agents to control the territory. Indirect rule often reshaped or institutionalized power relations at the local level, by legitimizing groups seeking hegemony over minorities. In a context where local political conflict between colonizers’ backed elites and minorities overlapped with religious boundaries, conversion to Christianity may have become a vehicle to articulate claims and coordinate against authorities, leaving a legacy of persistent and politicized religious identities. I address this question in the context of colonial Nigeria, where the Northern provinces overlapped with the territory of a pre-colonial Islamic state. I study the effects of assignment of ethnic groups to Muslim colonial authorities on Christian identification and political attitudes today, and the effects of mission penetration inside pre-colonial borders on religious mixing and episodes of conflict in the post-independence period. To this purpose, I use geo-referenced data on the distribution of European missions and contemporary surveys, and geographic regression discontinuities at Nigerian pre-colonial and colonial administrative boundaries.

We argue when the economic benefits provided by the peripheral regions to the central state are minimal, indirect rule would be favored as it helps to minimize the cost of ruling. When the perceived benefits associated with the resources extraction increases, however, rulers are tempted to establish direct rule. We construct a panel dataset to examine the effect of an exogenous price shock on the Qing rulers’ extension of direct rule into the formerly indirectly-ruled southwestern provinces. We find native chiefdoms endowed with copper were more likely to adopt direct rule in times of rising international copper prices. To avoid military confrontation, the Qing state preyed only upon the civilian chiefs, while leaving the military ones untouched, as the latter was appointed to provide social order. Our findings survive several alternative explanations of state building, and go beyond historical China to shed light on other cases where central power balanced their need to extract rents and deter rebellion.

We argue when the economic benefits provided by the peripheral regions to the central state are minimal, indirect rule would be favored as it helps to minimize the cost of ruling. When the perceived benefits associated with the resources extraction increases, however, rulers are tempted to establish direct rule. We construct a panel dataset to examine the effect of an exogenous price shock on the Qing rulers’ extension of direct rule into the formerly indirectly-ruled southwestern provinces.

Yet, there are few spatio-temporally disaggregated tests of the relationship between modernization processes and nationalism. More importantly, it is theoretically unclear whether modernization led to national cohesion and stabilized Europe’s multi-ethnic states or whether it destabilized them by fueling non-state nationalisms and separatist mobilization. In this paper, we use the gradual expansion of the European railway network 1816-1945 to investigate how this key technological driver of modernization affected ethnic separatism. Combining new historical data on ethnic settlement areas, conflict, and railway construction, we test how railroads affected independence claims, separatist conflict, and successful secession among non-core ethnic groups. Difference-in-differences and event study models show that railway-based modernization increased separatist mobilization and secession. Separatist responses to railway access concentrate in countries with small core groups and weak state capacity as well as in large and economically disadvantaged non-core groups. Overall, our findings caution against a simplistic understanding of the effects of European modernization.

In this paper, we look at Thailand’s railroad projects in the late-19th and early 20th centuries as an example of a state’s strategic response to colonial encroachment. By transporting government officials and establishing a permanent administrative presence, the railways served to ensure Thailand’s sovereignty over peripheral regions and bring them under direct governance. These regions, long considered economically unviable and disconnected from Bangkok, gained rail access due to their strategic importance and in turn witnessed urbanization and increased agricultural production.

These conditions were absent in some postcolonial societies, and yet well-defined property rights were codified. I advance a theory that underscores exogenous changes to labor institutions as drivers of property rights formation. I argue that the abolition of labor-repressive arrangements, such as slavery or the slave trade, encourages landed elites to delineate private property rights as a means to exclude free workers from accessing cultivable land and reduce the cost of labor. I use a multi-method strategy to test this argument in Imperial Brazil, where a ban on the Atlantic slave trade pushed planters to support the Land Law of 1850 to prevent immigrants from claiming land and hinder the rise of a commercial smallholder class. This paper shows how landed elites exploited a hallmark of private property to maintain their privileges: the right to exclude others

Evidence in political economy suggests that ethno-religious diversity undermines public service provision. We argue instead that competition across ethno-religious groups can enhance non-state public service provision by minorities, if they face an existentialist threat. Egyptian Coptic Christian elites engaged in rapid development of modern schooling in the 19th and early 20th century as a backlash to missionaries’ efforts to convert their followers. Employing original dataset of modern Egyptian schools (1825 – 1913), we show that competition created by American missionaries, that held the most contentious conversion program, caused a rise in the provision of Coptic schools, and that had almost double the effect size in comparison with other missionary groups. We employ an instrumented difference-in-difference design, we exploit the Egyptian Khedive's decision in 1878 to recognize Protestantism as a formal religious sect, and the geographic variation in Copt population share. We demonstrate that competition initiated through the surge in American missionary schools in areas with a high share of Copts, led to a significant increase of Coptic modern schools, post 1878.

Despite the importance of electoral contestation to classic conceptualizations of democracy, the historical origin of this institution is not well understood. In this paper, I consider the origin of contests in early modern England. I provide the first systematic documentation of the pattern of contest emergence over the long 17th century. Then, using newly-collected data on the universe of candidate selections---including their date, location and the characteristics of both returned MPs and their so-called challengers---I systematically evaluate competing theoretical accounts of their emergence, including those predicated on group cleavages, as well as those centered on eroding norms of consensuality. I find that eroding norms did not initially provoke contestation; instead, extant norms were superceded by socio-political interests reflecting an emergent cleavage between increasingly independent local power in opposition to traditional aristocratic power.

Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the Norwegian Industrial Revolution	Recent work has shown that a large share of employment in manufacturing (i.e., indus-trialization) is strongly correlated with democracy, even after accounting for countryand time fixed effects, time trends, and a wide range of plausible control variables.In this paper we exploit a unique quasi-experiment in 19th- and early 20th-centuryNorway that allows us to examine whether this correlation between industrializationand democratization is causal. Using novel roll-call data from the Norwegian nationalparliament we study whether MPs that represented more rapidly industrializing dis-tricts were more likely to vote for suffrage extensions over the 1891 to 1906 period. Forcausal identification we exploit that Norwegian districts with a greater geographicalpotential for hydropower generation were significantly more likely to industrialize afterthe nationwide introduction of hydroelectricity in 1892. Preliminary results suggestthat industrialization did cause democratization in Norway.

In contrast, this paper highlights the role of Dutch dukes and barons who set up the first national, professional party organizations to successfully challenge the independent liberals that had dominated Parliament since 1848. Realizing their strong position among the disenfranchised, the Antirevolutionaries would outflank even some Liberal factions in their drive to expand suffrage during the 1880s and 1890s. I supplement prior qualitative, historical research with analyses of a panel dataset on all candidates that stood for election between 1848 and 1918, coupled with highly detailed electoral and demographic statistics of Dutch municipalities, to provide evidence for the link between conservative party organization and democratization. These findings suggest a role for robust conservative party organizations in peaceful transitions to democracy, contradicting the canonical view that democratization results primarily from a revolutionary threat of the masses.

We document that voters who voted for exiting candidates are more likely to change their voting behavior in the subsequent election than the other voters. However, candidate exit explains only a fairly small part of the changes in the voting behavior over time within individual voters. This indicates that for quite a few voters the partisan ties were stronger than have been previously thought in this candidate-centered system with weak parties. We uncover three large voter groups: Loyalist Conservatives and loyalist Liberals who do not change party in general nor in response to candidate exit, and a volatile group who changes voting behavior both in general and more so in response to changes in the choice set.

We consider the canonical case of the secession of southern U.S. states in the 1860s where multiple regions explored secession and use novel hand-collected daily sub-sovereign bond data from the NYSE to understand the dynamic process of secession. We show that, after the election of President Lincoln in the fall of 1860, markets priced the risk of secession into southern and border states -- long before war broke out between the Confederacy and the North. Further, secession risk decreased as the number of states seceding increased, suggesting that markets reassessed the viability of the Confederacy based on the strategic decisions of states to join the movement. Moreover, consistent with a model where more homogeneous preferences make the outside option more attractive, financial markets viewed secession as less risky when it was validated by a popular vote rather than only a vote by subset of leaders.

Resistance movements across occupied Europe have been typically accused of not having helped their fellow Jewish citizens escape from genocide. In addition, a common view in political science holds that insurgents’ presence attracts more state violence. In contrast to this, I use multiple archival collections on WWI and WWII military personnel, Holocaust victims’ records, and testimonies of survivors and rescuers to show that insurgent presence in fact decreased local numbers of Holocaust victims. To ensure that the relationship is causal, I use an instrumental variable exploiting the exogenous number of WWI military deaths, which increased insurgent recruitment in WWII. Case studies of mechanisms reveal that the insurgents helped the Jews by using tactics they had developed to fight the incumbent. By studying a three-way relationship between the genocide targets, insurgents and the state, this article provides unexpected and quantifiable evidence about the most notorious genocide to-date.

We argue that, when their hegemony is threatened, local elites use patronage networks and the salience of political identities to mobilize their constituencies, first at the ballot box and then in armed conflict. We study the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and the pro-Franco uprising in the province of Navarre, a stronghold of rural conservatism, promoted by the traditionalist Carlist movement. We identify the roots of Carlist mobilization capacity in the countryside using newly digitized data on agrarian reforms in the early 19th century, and on combatants in the first Carlist war (1833-1840). We then measure the influence of Carlism on mobilization using individual-level archival data on electoral participation (1931-1936) and on the universe of Navarrese pro-Franco insurgents in 1936. We further study the role of elites influence and external threats to traditionalist identity on mobilization, with novel data on the partisan composition of municipal councils, local electoral competition, and affiliation to competing political identities, such as socialism and Basque nationalism. This project sheds light on the sociopolitical dynamics of interwar fascism.

The Legacies and Non-Legacies of Interruptions in Local Self-Government	Interruptions in local self-government are a common feature of both external imperial rule and centralized authoritarianism. Due to their similarities, the literature on historical legacies has considered both kinds of interruptions as potentially legacy-producing. But under which specific circumstances do these denials of local political autonomy actually lead to sustained changes in political behavior? We develop a novel framework that elucidates when interruptions in local self-rule will produce political legacies, and when they will fail to do so. Two factors are crucial: the duration of interruption and the scope of repression. Enduring interruptions characterized by encompassing repression are the most likely to generate persistent changes. Contrariwise, transient interruptions characterized by limited repressiveness are unlikely to produce legacies. Given our theory's broad character, we conduct empirical analyses in two markedly different settings: Poland, which was split between three major empires, and Brazil, where a military regime externally installed appointed mayors in a large number of cities. Our results demonstrate that interruptions in local self-government have varying potential to create legacies.

Concurrently, US polarisation literature showed that people perceive politics in affective rather than ideological terms, coining the term affective polarisation – the difference between positive bias towards in-group members and negative bias towards out-group members. Affective polarisation has repeatedly been linked to problematic consequences, such as democratic dysfunction. As its causes remain understudied in Europe, this paper explores whether individuals suffering from economic hardship are more affectively polarised. By experiencing negative emotions and a lack of self-esteem, individuals are theorised to emphasise group identity to recuperate status, which strengthens social distance towards out-group members. While financial and job insecurity literature tends to focus on objective measures, this paper also considers people’s perceptions of these insecurities. Moreover, it will test for the moderating effects of personality traits, such as neuroticism and narcissism. The empirical analysis relies on novel nationally representative data collected in 11 European countries (N = 14.000). Different measures of affective polarisation will be analysed, such as thermometer and social distance scales.

This current wave of populism across Europe has affected a wider swath of countries than ever before and has raised concerns about its consequences for democratic stability and backsliding. However, there have been very few empirical studies to test how and to what degree populism affects level of liberal democracy. Using both the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and Varieties of Party (V-Party) datasets, I conduct a cross-national observational study across 35 European countries over three decades (1994-2019) to analyze how and if populists in government, populists in the opposition, and general populist party presence affect the level of liberal democracy in a country. Additionally, I argue there is a key piece to this relationship that scholars have previously overlooked: affective polarization —partisans’ feelings of distrust, contempt, and dislike toward political opponents. I argue that affective polarization mediates the relationship between populism and democratic backsliding.

Often, these divisions are based on ideological identification, so that ideologies form the basis of social groups. However, even though the importance of ideological identification has long been recognized, research on affective polarization has so far largely ignored it. In this paper, we remedy this by adapting the design presented in Orr and Huber (2021) and Diaz and Lelkes (2022) to account for ideology in addition to partisan and policy issues. In addition, we include political involvement as a further characteristic (Krupnikov and Ryan 2021). Using this design, we test (a) the influence of ideological identities on inter-voter affect, (b) whether it remains relevant when accounting for other voter characteristics, i.e. partisanship, policy beliefs and involvement and (c) whether partisanship remains a relevant source of intra-voter affect once ideological identities are controlled for. We field our survey in Germany, a medium-size party system with long-lasting partisan and ideological identities.

However, the micro foundations of this transformation are less well understood. Here we take a voter-perspective to evaluate how party competition has been restructured in the eyes of the voter by leveraging measures of citizens’ self-reported propensities to vote for alternative parties (PTV) in the EES surveys from 1999 to 2019. Our analysis provides evidence of a substantial shift in voter assessment from party competition structured on the economic left-right dimension to the GAL-TAN dimension.

First, there appear to be almost no events that lead to noticeable changes in the number of people identifying with broad identity categories (e.g. """"""""journalist'', """"""""Christian''). We show this via unsupervised modeling of all the content in Twitter users' self-descriptions---automatically summarizing all identity-related words into 80 meaningful identities. Second, we investigate whether very significant negative events might lead to disavowal of specific identities whose status is threatened by the event (for instance, Catholic identity and Canadian school mass grave discoveries). We find that de-identification is an extremely rare response to negative events. In follow-up analyses, we plan to investigate whether status-threatened group members instead defend their identity through tweets.

Nevertheless, while societies have moved towards more inclusion, there is also more hostility directed towards Muslim minorities. One answer to this puzzle can be found in the conflict of liberal democratic values. Currently, existing work have mainly considered the juxtaposition of gender equality and minority rights. This paper goes beyond the question of gender equality and turns the focus towards a particular value conflict, namely that of child-rearing values. Through a series of survey experiments this paper demonstrates that there are large differences in the majority population’s willingness to include Muslim minorities. The results show that when Muslim minorities want to preach conservative child-rearing values, their democratic rights are completely rejected, while the rights of a Christian group preaching the same values are not. Using follow-up open-ended responses this paper further demonstrates the core differences in people’s perceptions and the reasons leading to religious discrimination.

I test this argument in the Spanish regions of Madrid and Catalonia through an online experiment where treated individuals are exposed to information that highlights the role of the societies of Madrid and Catalonia in the high rates of blood donation of Spain. I find that exposure to the treatment induces the reduction of negative attitudes towards out-group members without changing perceptions concerning the in-group category. These results updates our knowledge on how can social recategorization reduce affective polarization and prove that it can be applied in settings where groups are polarized on the dimension of territoriality or nationalist attachment rather thanalong partisan lines.

Insights from choice experiments on carbon removal policy	Most high-income countries struggle to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions fast enough. This has led to rapidly increasing interest in carbon removal approaches. The key issue here is that quasi-permanent, and thus highly effective carbon removal from the atmosphere is expensive, whereas less durable removal approaches, like reforestation, are cheaper. We examine how citizens, whose opinion drives climate policy choices and whose policy preferences are commonly presumed to be myopic, form preferences towards effective long-term versus low-cost short-term environmentalism. Our study design relies on choice experiments in two high-income European democracies (Switzerland, UK, N=3000 each). The randomly manipulated policy attributes in the experiment cover cost, durability of carbon removal, leakage risk, and implementation mode (gradual vs. full). We expect that long-term effectiveness of carbon removal increases public acceptance if uncertainty about the policy’s future effectiveness is low. For this reason, individuals with more trust in public institutions are also more likely to opt for policy designs that favour long-term effectiveness of carbon removal (durability) over costs, implicating a higher willingness to pay for effective long-term approaches to carbon removal.

Drawing on the notion that both environmental concern and carbon emissions increase with affluence, this study investigates whether high carbon emitters alter their support for ambitious environmental policies when primed with their revealed environmental impact. Going beyond dominant theoretical explanations such as the low-cost hypothesis or moral licensing, we assess how policy support changes if environmentally concerned citizens, who either ignore or are unaware of the negative impact of their behaviors, are primed with the respective information. We analyze changes in a rich set of environment-related policy preferences based on an experimental design implemented in a high-quality, population-representative panel survey in Switzerland (N=6000). Through an individualized information prime on personal carbon emissions, we resolve the rationale behind dominant theoretical explanations for the observed attitude-behavior gap by providing respondents with the supposedly absent or suppressed information. In particular, we measure within-subject changes in support of different environmental policies that vary in cost intensity, incorporating a voluntary, market-based or command-and-control approach.

However, the evidence presented in this paper suggest that this opposition may be overestimated. The study presents novel evidence from a coordinated online-survey among samples of both ordinary citizens, local elected representatives and public administrators in Norway. The results show both what citizens, politicians and bureaucrats themselves think about a specific proposal for meat reduction, as well as each group's perception of public opinion about the same specific proposal. The results are in line with recent studies estimating perceptual accuracy that find a tendency to overcompensate for own opinion when assessing public opinion. Such misperceptions of public opinion are unfortunate for the public debate, and for the adoption and implementation of new policies.

We find that citizens of these three countries, on average, support information disclosure requirements for firms as well as provisions allowing governments to sanction non-compliance. We further explore between-country variation in policy preferences, perceptions of policy benefits and costs, and interactions with key individual attitudinal and ideological priors.

We also compare these personal beliefs and normative expectations to those of White Democrats. Our findings suggest that Black and White Democrats agree on the norms of their partisan and American identities, but Black Democrats are more likely to express personal beliefs that are consistent with those normative expectations regarding institutional racism. This is because White Democrats are more likely to violate the group norms by disagreeing that situations which represent institutional racism are indeed instances of racism. Through a norm priming experiment, we find that White Democrats are more likely to express personal beliefs that are consistent with partisan norms regarding subtle racism, institutional and colorblind racism when primed to think about those norms. This is only true among Black Democrats for subtle racism.

To address this question, I study the case of Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, the co-developers of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and children of Turkish immigrants in Germany. I first demonstrate that German media favorably highlighted the Turkish roots and migration history of vaccine developers. Leveraging the quasi-experimental setting with the announcement of the success of the vaccine, I then posit that the wide broadcasting of the vaccine's success and its developers' identity should have positive spillover effects on public attitudes towards immigration. Amongst those who were exposed to this announcement, compared to those who were not, I find a 4 percentage point increase in support of easing immigration opportunities. I suggest that this effect is driven by a change in perceptions of self-awareness on issues relating to immigration and integration. These findings imply that positive media framing and highlighting successful integration can be key to social cohesion in host societies.

We randomly assigned personality descriptors from the Big Five Aspects Scales (BFAS), a well-validated personality inventory that splits up each of the Big Five into two aspects, to fictitious immigrant profiles. Our findings are threefold: First, we show that immigrants’ personalities which signal a greater willingness to integrate culturally, namely high politeness (part of Agreeableness), low volatility (part of Neuroticism) and high orderliness (part of Conscientiousness), have a strong causal effect on natives’ propensities to admit such immigrants into the UK. Second, we find similar effects for immigrants with personalities that signal greater economic potential, namely high industriousness (part Conscientiousness), enthusiasm (part of Extraversion), and intellect (part of Openness to Experience). Third, we find that, with the notable exception of openness (part of Openness to Experience), immigrants’ and natives’ personality congruence does not play a role in natives’ evaluations. Rather, natives scoring high in socially desirable traits disproportionately punish immigrants who do not possess such qualities.

What determines attitudes toward deportation? We focus on two countries where immigration is a key political issue and where populist right-wing politicians have been successful in recent years: the U.S. and Brazil. We ask what role economic contributions have in driving deportation attitudes and whether interventions describing an immigrant’s experience can reduce support for deportation. We study these questions with original survey experiments conducted in the U.S. and Brazil with representative samples. In our first experiment, we find that when respondents are exposed to a story describing the economic contributions of a hard-working immigrant in the host country, they are substantially less likely to support the deportation of undocumented immigrants. The importance of economic contributions to counteract support for deportation is confirmed in our second experiment: the share of respondents who oppose deportation increases significantly for different undocumented immigrant profiles when they are presented as entrepreneurs.

The entry of nativist and nationalist radical right parties can help normalize certain attitudes considered taboo among the population. This paper argues that the presence of an RPP in parliament has a legitimation effect that allows citizens to declare their antiimmigration attitudes, previously hidden. I test this argument using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology, examining whether the population expresses more negative attitudes towards immigration after the entry of Vox, a Spanish RRP, in the Andalusian Regional Parliament in 2018. Results show a strong positive relationship between Vox’s entry in parliament and people’s proclivity of expressing negative attitudes towards immigrants of the Andalusian population immediately after the election, compared to citizens from other regions of Spain. However, this effect does not hold in the long term. This article has important implications for our understanding of attitude normalization and RRP effects on society.

Results support the intergroup conflict-dominant leadership connection and, furthermore, panel analyses show that followers enhance their preferences for dominant leadership the more they experience aggressive emotions.

To investigate this question, we rely on a novel dataset of political violence from Greece during the snap parliamentary elections of May and June 2012. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we test causal effects of political violence on turnout and vote choice at the vote-center level in two major Greek cities, Athens and Thessaloniki. We find strong positive effects of political violence on voter turnout, and strong negative results on the vote for the incumbent socialists and the radical left. Vote for the conservatives and the communist party increases in precincts with geographic proximity to violent events between the two elections.

In this paper, I trace the permanent effects of repression against civilians on their support for autocracy. A growing literature shows that autocracies repress citizens and social organizations by psychological, digital or physical means imposing legitimacy and stability. Drawing on evidence from an historical case in Turin, Italy, I show how state political violence against civilians results in persistent decrease of support for autocracy, even when a regime change takes place. I first gather qualitative new data by reviewing over 500 newspaper articles on protests and repressions in Turin between 1867 and 1922. Second, I implement automated webscraping approach on state archives to over 89,000 previously classified individual-level data on National Fascist Party members. To empirically test this claim, I implement spatial regression discontinuity designs and show that areas exposed to state political repression during the monarchy era did not support fascism. The findings show that state political violence causes negative support for authoritarian regimes, providing a permanent challenge to the regime, hindering their legitimacy.

Research has shown that government performance and political detachment influence Australians’ distrust (Dasonneville and McAllister, 2020; Cameron, 2020). Yet, in electoral democracies, political parties are critical actors as they link voters and political institutions. This paper argues that voters with different levels of partisanship strength have a different perception of government performance (specific political support), and political trust (general political support). It is expected that supporters of the winning party will have greater political confidence than electoral losers. Moreover, strong government supporters should be more lenient towards government performance, while strong opponents should remain distrustful. Lastly, voters showing either weak party government support or weak support for the opposition, will be more likely to respond to performance in their evaluation of the government while also making more independent assessments of political institutions than stronger government and opposition partisans.

The spatial theory of voting has frequently been criticized for assuming too much of the average voter: voters need to identify their personal ideal points and the locations of the party alternatives. Grofman's discounting models brings the political """"""""status quo"""""""" back in: voters are supposed to factor in how far candidates or parties, if elected, will be able to move the status quo towards their advertised spatial positions. Theoretically, the discounting model is a very compelling approach. It is able to explain patterns of polarizing trusteeship when party elites factor in discounting and assume much more """"""""extreme"""""""" policy stances than their electoral constituencies. The discounting model may also provide explanations for protest voting, electoral, and political polarization from within the spatial modeling tradition. Empirical applications, however, have been rare and often based on studies of individual cases or elections. This contribution aims at closing this critical research gap. We focus on rich evidence from the first four waves of the CSES project and apply Bayesian statistical tools so as to probe the added value of discounting party positions.

This study builds on this literature to investigate if voters facing a policy change discount future political costs too. Stemming from psychological theories, the main hypothesis is that political costs should be intrinsically different and less subject to discounting. A survey experiment fielded with Italian and UK participants empirically investigates this hypothesis. The findings show that voters strongly resist policies that will affect their choices in the future — that is, they don’t devalue future political costs even if they can have an economic advantage in the present. However, this is moderated by ideology: Voters with pre-existing views that are congruent with an irreversible policy better tolerate a restriction in future policy alternatives. These results have important implications for our understanding of voters’ preferences for policy outcomes. Moreover, these findings show that campaigns on issues of sustainability should stress future political costs more strongly than they do now.

Recent literature on MPs’ legislative behaviour highlights the importance of an MP’s mandate for their strategic behaviour in parliament. However, the underlying assumption that citizens, too, differentiate between the two types of MPs in mixed-member systems has not yet been empirically tested. Using a novel dataset of incumbent German Bundestag MPs from 1953-2021, I show that MPs’ vote share in electoral districts does not significantly change because of their attained mandate. Further exploring this mechanism on the individual level, I demonstrate that citizens’ knowledge and re-election of MPs do not differ between list MPs and nominal MPs. I conclude that the mandate divide in mixed-member systems might be present among MPs but is not perceived by the citizens. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the causes of the mandate divide in the legislative behaviour literature. If citizens do not differentiate between MPs, then the strategic behaviour of district MPs either fails to hit its target or is differently motivated than initially assumed.

The relationship between improving the public realm and electoral fortunes	Public realm works constitute one of the most visible and constant actions governments undertake. Investment on public spaces has a direct impact on people's most familiar surroundings, their quality life, and their social capital. Yet, the retrofitting of public spaces may generate negative externalities, such as gentrification. Given the importance of public realm works, it is surprising that we are largely oblivious to their effect on political behaviour. This article examines the impact of a soft planning strategy known as the Catalan Neighbourhood Law, which had the goal of converting several designated urban areas--especially areas with acute urban deficits--into better and more sustainable places to live. After digitising the different interventions, as well as those areas that could have potentially been redeveloped but were not funded, the empirical design relies on a staggered DID and examines whether they improved the electoral support of the incumbent (or the opposition). To gauge the mechanism, we capture exposure to public realm improvements using geo-located individual-level surveys. This article has important implications for our understanding of the relationship between urban policies and political behaviour.

As such, there is considerable scholarly interest in uncovering the trade-offs voters face when deciding to vote between a democratic and undemocratic yet otherwise appealing party or candidate. This paper presents a conjoint experiment in this direction embedded in a nationally representative surveys in Turkey, an important electoral autocracy. Unlik e existing approaches, respondents face a choice betw een two hypothetical future scenarios for the country rather than fictional candidates, with random variations across the ideology of government, the state of the economy, orientation of foreign policy, and the country’s level of democracy. Analyses reveal which characteristics identify voters who prioritize democracy over other considerations.

A Longitudinal Analysis of the Evolution of Support for Stealth Democracy	With the contemporary increase in populism in many western democracies, scholarly interest in people's democratic process preferences has soared the past decade. Stealth democracy - the idea that the people do not really want active democratic participation and prefer politics to be efficient, including non-elected experts and business men - was introduced to capture what seem to be a participation-inclusion fatigue in the people. Yet, we know little about how support for stealth democracy changes over time, including how its socio-demographic and regional composition changes in a longitudinal perspective. Utilizing data from Denmark (2011 and 2019), I conclude that preferences for stealth democracy has significantly decreased over time. Yet, simultaneously, preferences for stealth democracy has become more polarized with stronger gender, educational, and regional divisions over time. Furthermore, we see support for new emerging parties vis-a-vis older and established parties are associated with stealth democracy preferences. The results are discussed in a future light, evaluating current democratic decision-making institutions in the light of individual preferences for stealth democracy.

Electoral turnovers and excess mortality	The transfer of power via elections is an essential feature of democracies. We investigate the effect of such electoral turnovers on a crucial health measure, excess mortality. Our data comes from France, where local elections were held at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in mid-2020. Using regression, matching, and regression discontinuity designs to analyze 5,000 electoral decisions, we demonstrate substantial negative side-effects of electoral turnovers. Municipalities where the incumbent mayor was defeated experienced between 7 and 11 percentage points higher excess mortality as compared to municipalities were the incumbent held on to their office. Theoretical considerations and data on mask-wearing mandates suggest that electoral turnovers cause frictions, which can delay the implementation of effective disease-control measures. While crucial for the functioning of democracy, holding elections comes at a cost.

Identifying preferences for combinations of actors in government across nine European democracies.	Research on citizens’ attitudes towards alternative actors in government is expanding, but limited in two respects: most studies have focused only on preferences for “ordinary citizens” and “independent experts” as decision-makers and most studies do not show preferences for combinations of actors. To address these shortcomings, we analyzed how citizens from nine European countries scored on 21 survey items recently developed by Hibbing and colleagues (2022) to capture preferences for a variety of actors and governing styles. The data were analysed through multi-group latent classes analysis, a method that is well-suited to identifying discrete clusters of individuals with similar patterns of response across multiple indicators. Our results point to seven different groups: 32% of citizens prefer being governed by a mix of actors; 16% are favourable towards expert-informed politicians; 14% demand a greater role for ordinary citizens; 12% are open to anything but politicians; 11% want expert-informed referenda; 10% support a combination of politicians and ordinary citizens; and 5% are only willing to be governed by experienced politicians. However, the size and socio-demographic characteristics of these groups differ across countries.

Results indicate that negative partisans avoid positive content about their disliked party, but do not seek negative content in order to 'validate' their aversion.

How Negative Partisanship Shapes Media Consumption Habits	A vast literature on the concept of selective exposure suggests that individuals tend to consume information that is congruent with their pre-existing dispositions, such as their preferred party. However, we still know little about the effects of negative partisanship, individuals' rejection of a particular party, on media consumption habits. Do negative partisans seek or avoid news about their disliked party? I attempt to answer this question through the combination of a three-wave panel survey (N = 2,200) and web-tracking data collected before and after the 2021 German federal election. I classify each news article read by respondents based on what party they refer to and its general tone (positive/negative). I then explore whether negative partisans consume disproportionately more or less news about their disliked party, and whether this is conditional on the polarity of the article. Results indicate that negative partisans avoid positive content about their disliked party, but do not seek negative content in order to 'validate' their aversion.

Targeted Attacks and Coalition Logic on Negative Campaigning in Multiparty Systems	Negative campaigning, mostly a phenomenon of a two-party system like the U.S., is more actively used in multiparty systems. Here, the logic of attack is much more nuanced, as parties need to choose their targets based on coalition options and ideological compatibility. The question remains if parties are office-seeking or policy-seeking in these attacks. We test the effect of the feasibility of each coalition option and ideological proximity to each other party, on the target choice of political parties. We use data from 9 German state and federal elections between 2020 and 2022, where coalition options and probabilities vary both between elections and over time. We combine published polling results that lead to the mathematical possibility of coalitions, as well as the ideological distance between the respective parties. For negative campaigning, we classify attacks and targets from 3,600,000 social media posts using a transformer model trained on 50,000 manually annotated posts. We find that parties are strongly driven by their policy preferences - they will rather dampen attacks in general rather than attack their potential partners, even though coalitions are unlikely.

The link between party positions and their political discourses.	Do political parties use justifications in their speeches that support their positions on European integration? This paper explores this question by linking studies of political communication to the literature on political competition over European integration. We argue that parties in favour of integration are more likely to justify their views by appealing to normative integration values and the quality of policy outputs. Eurosceptic parties should focus on procedural rules, and they should deliver more emotionally negative messages. The empirical analysis focuses on four key debates over European integration: the Constitutional Convention, the debates about Sixpack and European Stability Mechanism, and Schengen. Using computational text analysis (seeded topic models and sentiment analysis), we find that communication strategies by and large follow partisan positions on the EU in support of positional strategies. Pro-integration parties are more likely to talk about democratic values, economic performance, social conditions, solidarity and human rights, whereas anti-integration parties focus on institutional procedures and invoke (less relevant) goals from other issue domains. When they refer to normative values, they tend to use negative framings.

This begs the following question: why are politicians so negative if this strategy does not increase their re-election chances? In this paper, I argue that negativity usage by politicians is affected by the mediatization of politics: politicians use negativity because, due to the negativity bias in the news, it increases their chances of gaining media attention. I test this hypothesis using individual-level data on Belgian politicians’ negativity usage in the parliament and their presence in the prime-time TV news (2010-2020). The results show that going negative in the parliament significantly increases politicians' chances of appearing in the TV news later that day, despite controlling for relevant predictors such as politicians’ rank, gender, and ideology. In turn, once politicians get media attention due to negativity, their chance of going negative again in the future increases significantly.

An empirical analysis of the content and impressions of parties’ Instagram and Facebook Ads in the 2021 German election campaign.	While it has been argued that parties adapt their messages to target groups to maximise electoral support, we know little about the content of these ads. How do parties tailor the content of these targeted messages and how is this tailoring influencing their success? Based on theoretical expectations derived from the literature about group appeals and party competition, we will provide empirical answers to these questions. We first show how parties tailor the content of their targeted campaign messages. Second, we investigate if the tailoring of campaign content leads to greater success. We tackle these questions using a manual content analysis of the Facebook and Instagram Ads by German parties (n=4200) during the 2021 general election and merging it with the novel Meta Ad Targeting Dataset. This gives us the opportunity to explore which target groups the parties selected to reach, and how they adapted the message content to these target groups. Lastly, we make use of the impressions of these ads as a measurement of success. The findings will provide original insights about the effects of modern election campaigns.

While the relationship between centralization and contention is well-documented, little work exists on the relationship between contention and decentralization. Leveraging insights from multilevel governance, community formation, and political behavior, we argue that state decentralization changes the structure and quantity of protest through three mechanisms. First, decentralization creates more arenas for contention where the chances for success are higher. Second, decentralization shifts the nucleus of political and economic power downwards, making localized social networks more important for mobilization. These networks are denser in the weak ties essential for political mobilization. Finally, these dynamics are self-reinforcing over time. We hypothesize that 1) higher levels of decentralization are associated with higher rates of protest throughout the country, 2) higher levels of regional authority are associated with higher rates of protest within that region, and 3) higher levels of decentralization are associated with less country-level synchronicity in protest rates because of decreased importance of national-level factors. We test our hypotheses using a novel dataset merging the Regional Authority Index, automated event counts, and regional and national-level socio-economic controls in 34 developed democracies from 2000-2018.

First, representatives who have strong subnational attachments and who come from peripheral jurisdictions are more likely to find it important to represent their constituents. Second, the extent to which elected representatives are inclined to follow their voters instead of their party depends on the identarian and distributional consequences of the policy at hand. These hypotheses are tested through a survey experiment fielded to around 2,000 elected municipal and county representatives in Norway in February 2022. The results support our hypotheses: representatives –and especially those with strong subnational attachments—are more inclined to deviate from their party when the policy decision is related to the identity or welfare of the subnational jurisdiction. In addition, representatives –and especially those from rural and peripheral jurisdictions—are more inclined to deviate from their party when the costs are largely borne by the subnational jurisdiction.

The effect of crises upon preferences for power allocation.	The centralization of power is a predictable organizational pattern of crisis response. Following the emergence of unexpected shocks such as natural disasters, pandemics or economic recessions may lead to more centralized decision-making. Yet little is known on the extent to which citizens’ exposure to different types of crises may shape their attitudes towards the (de)centralization of power, on whether their attitudes actually correspond to a centripetal drift in power allocation or the duration of the effect. This paper explores these questions by theorizing on how various types of crises - namely short-term shocks such as sanitary crises or long-term threats such as climate change - may differently shape individuals’ preferences for the (de)centralization of power across supranational, national, regional or local authorities. Hypotheses are tested using both observational (panel) data and experimental studies in Spain. Empirical evidence shows that the covid-19 sanitary crisis prompted a centralizing drift in citizens’ preferences. Subject to further investigation, preliminary evidence regarding the impact of climate change shows that this type of crisis causes a centralizing drift towards supranational (European) institutions.

An important hope associated with mini-publics is that they will help to alleviate public discontent with politics and contribute to perceptions of legitimate decision-making. I argue that the effects of mini-publics on legitimacy perceptions depend crucially on the extent to which they live up to the ideal of random selection and, more specifically, their composition reflects the broader citizenry. To test my expectations, I ran a pre-registered survey experiment in the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,200). I find that the involvement of mini-publics in political decision-making can increase legitimacy perceptions if its composition fully reflects the citizenry; however, even small deviations from representativity decrease these beneficial effects substantially while larger deviations can wipe them out entirely. Overall, these results constitute a challenge for hopes that mini-publics constitute an effective response to perceptions of political illegitimacy.

These deliberative mini-publics have been a key demand of many environmental groups, and the United Kingdom (among other countries) has taken modest steps in this direction. Yet if climate assemblies are to be effective, their decisions must cease to be mere recommendations. We present the results of two experiments fielded via a UK survey to investigate this central question: under what circumstances is the public more likely to support the use of binding citizens’ climate assemblies? The first experiment focuses on how the public reasons about granting extra influence to social groups that would be especially affected by climate change and climate change legislation. The second experiment examines how public support is shaped by elite partisan conflict and whether the climate assembly is promoted by politicians or the general public.

We test whether the use of open consultations reduces the negative impact of these inequalities on citizens’ legitimacy assessments of policy-making. Moreover, we examine whether adopting policy decisions that go against public opinion on an issue increases the negative consequences of inequalities in group involvement while acting in line with public opinion lowers them. Our expectations are tested through a survey experiment with a conjoint design. Attributes such as the type of consultation, interest group representation, and public opinion are randomly varied. The findings have important implications not only for understanding how different types of inequalities in interest group participation affect the legitimacy of policy making but for teasing out whether decision-makers can affect these assessments by their choice of consultation mechanisms and use of public opinion data.

Public perceptions, politicians' lived experiences and interest representation	Past research suggests that institutions, which are descriptively more diverse are also more representative of a variety of societal sub-groups. However, most of this research has focused almost exclusively on (visible) demographic characteristics. We argue that there are compelling arguments for going beyond visible characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. In particular, we contend that shared lived experiences could help politicians ‘react more or less the way the voter would have done, on the basis of descriptive similarity’ (Mansbridge 1999: 644), particularly under unprecedented circumstances or in the context of unarticulated interests. With this paper, we go beyond descriptive similarities between representatives and represented by focusing on politicians’ reported non-professional interests, life-style choices and family status that lead to unique underlying experiences. By using conjoint design survey experiment, we will examine how knowledge of politicians’ lived experiences influences citizens’ evaluation of politicians' and parties' likability and policy-making competence on specific issues. We expect that information on politicians’ interests and backgrounds provides citizens with informational shortcuts that influence who voters perceive as most likeable and most able to develop meaningful policies.

Recent evidence suggests that better party-voter matching reduces abstention rates. However, whether the same applies when considering the relationship between party candidates and voters has not yet been examined. Parties are dynamic political actors that internally conflate differing views, which are presented to voters through the different party candidates. The alignment of voters with certain party candidates may be sufficient to satisfy their representational demands. This paper argues that the relationship between candidate-voter congruence and turnout is stronger when the parties feature candidates who overlap with the ideological positioning of their voters. Conversely, an increase in abstention is anticipated if voters fail to relate to their potential representatives, and, as a result, distrust towards parties and elections intensifies. Using data from 72 elections (2005-2020), I estimate the overall level of ideological congruence and its effects on voter turnout for the first time with a many-to-many approach. The results highlight important oversights in how we conceptualise political representation, its quality and its impact on electoral participation.

Generations of scholars have debated whether a representative should represent their voters or all citizens - however, insights into how and why citizens think about this have remained rare despite its democratic-theoretical relevance. I argue that winning causes citizens to perceive their interests as more important than the common good, whereas electoral losers expect their representatives to consider all interests equally. Relying on a regression discontinuity design in close German district elections, I demonstrate that winning induces citizens to expect their MP to represent their voters instead of the whole constituency. I present suggestive evidence that citizens' self-interested considerations rather than a reinforced group identity explain this winner-loser gap. My findings indicate that citizens understand democracy in a self-serving way and that winners are more willing to exclude political opponents from the democratic process.

Issue Trade-offs and Democratic Backsliding	Recent studies have shown that citizens in established democracies are willing to make significant trade-offs between valued political goals and democratic principles. While the role of co-partisanship has been much studied in relation to democratic backsliding, we know less about the particular types of policy issues that are more likely to make citizens prioritize them over democratic norms. Yet, these questions are particularly salient in the context of European multiparty systems that have experienced significant party system realignments in recent years. Drawing on the literature on issue evolution and issue salience we hypothesize that identity-related issues which do not fit into the traditional left-right issue dimension are more likely to generate trade-offs between issue congruence and democratic principles. Our theoretical expectations are tested with evidence from a pre-registered conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey conducted in Finland (n=2406).

As 'microscope with a quality seal', surveys are considered alongside expert assessments. Contrasting with this optimistic perspective, literature on citizens' tolerance for democratic backsliding has questioned to which extent citizens are able to even recognize democratic backsliding and highlighted factors that may cloud citizens' judgement. In this paper, I bridge these two literatures to study whether citizens recognize democratic backsliding in contemporary Europe. Departing from the former literature, I look at changes over time which holds citizens to a higher standard than aggregate assessments. Departing from the latter, I look at large-scale trajectories of democratization and autocratization instead of assessing individual reforms via survey experiments. Building on the European Social Survey as well as original survey data, I show that while citizens' assessments show aggregate correlations with other indicators of democratic quality, they are not sensitive to democratic backsliding even in cases of protracted autocratization. Moreover, I show how party identification, political interest and education impact citizens' sensitivity to recognizing democratic backsliding.

Interest Groups and the Behavior of Connected Parliamentarians during the Democratic Backsliding in Japan 1928-1942.	Who vote to limit their own power during democratic backsliding? I examine the voting record, biography, electoral returns, interest group membership, and parliamentary group membership of the members of the House of Representatives in pre-war/wartime Japan (Election year: 1928, 1930, 1932, 1936, 1937, 1942), then run several difference-in-differences analyses taking advantage of exogenous shocks. I find that the parliamentarians backed by business or agricultural interest groups mostly resisted the power grab by the army after the Great Depression, but since the start of the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937), most of them flipped the positions and started to support the military rule. Interestingly, however, those industries that were irrelevant to the war effort (Silk, Banking, Brewery etc.) fervently supported the military cabinet, and those that were essential for the mobilization (Shipping, Railroads, Warehouses etc.) tended to oppose the war and military government. It appears that those sectors that were badly hurt by the war and sanctions desperately needed quid pro quo to receive governmental support, while those retained some bargaining power vis-à-vis the military struggle to defend democratic institutions.

Recent concerns about democratic backsliding in established democracies have raised the question: Will citizens notice violations of democratic norms and reject political decisions that lead to their desired outcome? Existing studies paint a pessimistic picture, suggesting that citizens are unable to restrain themselves when on the winning side of political competition and to call out undemocratic behaviour for what it is. This paper investigates winners’ restraint in the UK. It adds to the literature on citizens’ ability to resist undemocratic practices by examining winners’ reaction to accumulating violations of democratic norms. Just as in the real world democratic erosion happens gradualy, we test whether citizens are responsive or become immune to repeated violations of democratic norms. Results show that, while double standards exist and winning is the main predictor for peoples’ perceived legitimacy of political decisions, citizens are sensitive to repeated norm violations. In two experimental studies, we investigate how far winners are willing to go before rejecting flawed processes, and find that a majority of winners change their perceptions of fairness and legitimacy when exposed to multiple flaws.

However, it is unclear whether polarization is as detrimental to democratic governance as this trend implies or whether it is actually beneficial and engaging. Several studies have found that polarization increases turnout and overall political engagement, but elite polarization is also associated with the rise of extreme parties. This contribution argues that these disparaging observations are a result of the different ways in which attitude formation and political behaviour respond respond to elite polarization. I present a new mechanism and measure to understand the individual level effect of polarization on voter satisfaction with democracy and voting intentions. I test this relationship across 30 democracies using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. I consistently find a negative effect of polarization on democratic satisfaction across all data sources, policy, and ideological dimensions. At the same time I find a consistent positive effect on turnout. Consequently, polarization can be both a boon for engaging the electorate and increasing turnout and a bane for decreasing satisfaction with democracy.

An establishedliterature studies the stability of individual attitudes over time, and researchers often assume that partisanship is fixed during electoral periods. Against these assumptions, we demonstrate that elections cause large partisan shifts among voters. We argue that after elections losers might distance themselves from previously voted parties, while winners remain safely attached to the bandwagon. We demonstrate this phenomenon both at the level of parties and of individual voters. First, we leverage monthly opinion polls to show that defeated parties lose support among the electorate in the aftermath of national elections. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest lasting negative effects on party support. Second, we use household panel surveys to establish that voters who supported declining parties are more likely to change in favor of gaining parties. This paper contributes to the literature on post-electoral politics by highlighting a new dimension along which democratic winners and losers diverge. Moreover, the existence and magnitude of post-electoral partisan shifts suggest caution about the assumption of stable preferences common in much applied work.

The Role of Affective Polarization	Elections generally boost satisfaction with democracy (SWD) but not among radical and populist party voters. These two findings are hardly compatible with the single in-group logic that takes SWD changes as a function of the own party results. Instead, this paper proposes that affectively polarized radical voters will also react to the out-group party outcomes. When facing a defeat, a negative response to the out-group win will outweigh the positive impact of the relative in-group success. We test this argument by leveraging the uncertainty between rounds of the 2022 French presidential election. First, we prime voters of the new radical candidate Éric Zemmour with their party's relative success or their primary opponent's victory (Macron). Consistently with the expectations, priming Zemmour's voters with Macron's victory substantially decreases SWD, but none of the in-group conditions has any significant effect. Second, a qualitative analysis of an open-ended question supports an affective mechanism. These findings shed light on the relationship between SWD and affective polarization. Contrary to representation theories, the institutional inclusion of marginalized groups may only exacerbate dissatisfaction in highly polarized electoral contexts.

We exploit the coincidence of the fieldwork of the EVS and ESS with national elections, as well as variation in the timing of survey interviews with respect to the election day in the CSES. This identification strategy provides exogenous variation in winner/loser status and election salience. This allows us to causally assess whether winners are willing to exercise restraint without abusing their position as winners, and losers are willing to accept their defeat without questioning the democratic system. Crucially, our design also allows us to study whether the potential lack of restraint and consent that immediately follows elections dissipates as time goes by and elections lose salience.

However, most previous studies on the subject have been unable to isolate the impact of winning/losing from the correlates of party choice. This paper quasi-experimentally studies how winning and losing elections affects individuals’ support for democracy and checks and balances, and how differences between winners/losers change as elections lose salience (as time passes, after elections have taken place). We exploit the coincidence of the fieldwork of the EVS and ESS with national elections, as well as variation in the timing of survey interviews with respect to the election day in the CSES. This identification strategy provides exogenous variation in winner/loser status and election salience. This allows us to causally assess whether winners are willing to exercise restraint without abusing their position as winners, and losers are willing to accept their defeat without questioning the democratic system. Crucially, our design also allows us to study whether the potential lack of restraint and consent that immediately follows elections dissipates as time goes by and elections lose salience.

Effects of party cues on evaluations of checks and balances reforms 	Reforms of checks and balances are often used to reshape and undermine existing democratic institutions. How do citizens respond to such reforms? This paper studies the effects of party cues on (a) support for reforms and (b) motivations assigned to the reformers who propose to reform checks and balances. In addition, it investigates whether citizens evaluate such reform proposals differently than other proposals. It compares the checks and balances reforms to an inconsequential administrative reform without differential effects on citizens depending on their position vis-à-vis the government. Using a mixed-design survey experiment with a large sample (N = 1040) of Polish citizens, the study shows that (1) the supporters of the ruling party evaluate all reforms through rose-colored glasses, whereas the opponents are more suspicious of potential violations of democratic rules; (2) the administrative reform was evaluated more positively and not seen as ill-intended, by contrast with the checks and balances reforms. All in all, citizens see reforms of checks and balances differently depending on who proposes them. However, overall, these reforms are not received with great enthusiasm.

Despite some contributions, the relationship among these three factors is little studied, especially from a comparative perspective. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between tolerance towards minority groups, affective polarization and citizen commitment to democratic norms in five countries of southern Europe and Latin America. Our argument is that intolerance towards those groups fuels both partisan affective polarization and rejection of democratic and liberal norms; and that affective polarization in turn reinforces anti-democratic attitudes (especially those related to the possibility of banning parties), partially mediating the impact of social intolerance. To test these expectations, the paper uses an original panel survey (TRI-POL) which was carried out between September 2021 and April 2022 in Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This dataset contains thermometer feelings towards different social groups (e.g. immigrants, homosexuals, territorial/ethnic groups) and voters of parties in each country, attitudes towards democratic norms and other information from respondents.

This study examines whether partisans' tolerance of undemocratic behavior extends to election cheating. Using three novel, preregistered survey experiments, the study demonstrates that partisans do not display a partisan double standard, disapproving disproportionately of cheating by opponents. The findings show that even relatively subtle forms of election cheating by an in-partisan candidate affectively depolarizes voters, whereas similar cheating by an out-partisan candidate polarizes. Exposure to in-partisan election cheating causes voters to reduce in-party affect and simultaneously increase out-party affect. However, these backlash effects depend on the information source. When out-partisan media provides the information, partisans tend to dismiss the information as incredible cries of foul play. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democracy's viability and provide some counterbalance to the current narrative that partisan tribalism undermines voters' commitment to democracy. The findings also speak to the role of partisan identification as an unmoved mover.

Using a candidate-choice conjoint experiment we established that voters in seven European countries (Serbia, Poland, Germany, Ukraine, Spain, Sweden, and Estonia) tend to trade off democratic principles for interests that are related to the group they belong to. We also measured polarization, which often served as an explanation for voters’ willingness to tolerate undemocratic behavior, but could not identify an increased polarization for many of the interests for which voters would trade off democracy. Drawing on empirical evidence from two countries from the survey sample (Poland and Serbia) in which substantial democratic backsliding recently occurred, this paper offers additional explanation of voters’ increased tolerance for undemocratic behavior. Using the process tracing, and building on the findings from social psychology, the paper demonstrates that in Poland and Serbia, political entrepreneurs (Jaroslaw Kaczynski and PiS; Aleksandar Vucic and SNS) managed to subvert democracy by politicizing in-group identity and weaponizing it against democracy, regardless of polarization.

Comparative research identifies strong correlations between competing parties’ differences on cultural and economic issues, on the one hand, and citizens’ cross-party hostility, i.e., affective polarization, on the other. Yet we do not know which specific cultural or economic issues drive affective polarization. We analyze this question with a priming experiment with 11,000 individuals across 10 western publics, which prompts respondents to provide open-ended answers to a prompt inviting them to discuss how political parties compete either on cultural or economic issues. We find that respondents who discuss immigration, as either a cultural or an economic issue, express significantly more resentment and distrust towards political opponents. We conclude that immigration debates significantly drive affective polarization, regardless of whether citizens view these debates through a cultural or an economic frame.

A Quasi-Experimental Analysis	Does elite polarization increase affective polarization? I study this question with a real-world a sudden increase in elite polarization in the United Kingdom when the Labour Party suddenly adopted a more extreme ideological stance in 2015. Using British Election Study Internet Panel data, I find that higher ideological elite polarization leads to higher affective polarization. Moreover, the effect of elite polarization is not only limited to in-partisans (i.e., Labour identifiers) but it also extends to out-partisans (i.e., Conservative identifiers). Importantly, in-party feelings drive the increase in affective polarization more than out-party feelings. Affective polarization is not necessarily a reflection of out-party animosity but can fluctuate due to changes in in-party enthusiasm, which cautions against a bipolar conceptualization of in- and out-party feelings. Lastly, I show that the causal direction between how citizens perceive elite ideological polarization and how affectively polarized they are is bidirectional, which means that affective polarization is rooted both in identity and policy. While some levels of affective polarization are inherent in democracies, affective polarization can, to a certain extent, be tamed by moderate position-taking by parties.

We rely on data from a conjoint experiment that was conducted as part of the 2022 French election study, in which participants choose a potential lodger between two individual profiles, characterised among others by their partisan preference. This allows determining to what extent respondents’ choices are influenced by the partisan leaning of the potential lodgers, and whether this effect is stronger among affectively polarised citizens. Such effects of AP have been observed in other settings. We extend this approach in two ways. First, we include partisan social identity (Huddy et al. 2018) as a moderator. We expect negative effects of AP to be more pronounced when citizens’ partisanship is a more central part of their social identity. Second, we measure AP in two distinct ways: based on affect towards political parties or towards the supporters of these parties. This makes it possible to assess which form of AP is more likely to lead to discrimination against out-groups.

More specifically, the contribution of this article lies in examining the mechanisms through which affective polarization reduces post-election satisfaction with democracy after elections, particularly among winners, thus narrowing the winner-loser gap. To this end, the article is divided into two sections. First, the article examines the main triggers of affective polarization in electoral campaigns, focusing on two phenomena: party/ideological polarization and negative campaigning. Second, this paper examines the relationship between affective polarization and the winner-loser gap. The findings show party polarization increases the level of affective polarization, while the empirical evidence on the effects of negative campaigning on this phenomenon is not entirely robust. Moreover, the results show that the winner-loser gap decreases significantly due to the decline in satisfaction with democracy among affective polarized winners.

We find that Britons’ environmental attitudes have become increasingly aligned with partisanship and cultural ideology. Studying multiple environment items allows us to show that this pattern is not restricted to beliefs about climate change, but also applies to attitudes concerning environmental policy and behaviours. However, we also find that levels of environmental politicisation in Britain remain limited relative to that found in the US.

Exploring socio-cultural and economic inequality mechanisms	Right-wing populist (RWP) parties are gaining popularity at the same time as the climate crisis is escalating. Scholars have studied RWP parties’ positions on climate change and RWP supporters’ opposition to climate policy. Yet, little is known about the effect of RWP rhetoric about climate change on individual opposition to climate policy. Individuals can reject climate policy if the latter puts a strain on individuals’ economic conditions via threat to employment with the closure of carbon intensive or increased living costs with carbon tax (e.g. the economic dimension) and/or if they see the climate agenda as being espoused by a liberal, cosmopolitan elite (e.g. the cultural dimension). This paper investigates these two dimensions using a survey experiment conducted in the United Kingdom (UK). We draw on framings actually used by real right-wing figures prominent in the UK debate, either blaming climate policy for the cost-of-living crisis or casting climate policy as the ideological project of progressive urbanites. This experiment would help us make causal inferences about what drives individuals to oppose climate policies, and how they express that opposition.

Can fiction make the climate crisis real? Globally, low levels of climate awareness, belief, and concern suggests that existing strategies to change opinions and behavior around climate change remain relatively ineffective (Leiserowitz et al. 2022). In this paper, we examine a new strategy for inducing climate awareness building on work in psychology and political science that uses narrative strategies to shape attitudes and behavior. This approach, called perspective-getting, can change opinions on a range of subjects from immigration and refugee acceptance to LGBTQ rights (Eyal et al 2018, Kalla and Broockman 2021, Adida et al 2022). We design a narrative treatment that goes beyond the standard perspective-getting approach, using fictional narratives to both convey information and evoke emotion, which can affect information processing and information-seeking behavior. In a large cross-country online experiment, we randomly expose respondents to a purse control condition, to a factual scientific framing of climate information, and to a fictional narrative containing the same information to test the effectiveness of fictional climate narratives in improving climate literacy.

The Link between Political and Non-Political Environmentally-Friendly Behaviour	How are political and non-political behaviour on the environment linked? Discussions on how to tackle climate change often focus on individual actions of sustainable consumption and more environmentally-friendly habits. As the environment becomes more politicised, to what extent do voters separate political behaviour from other types of behaviour? How can these behaviours be influenced? We argue that political cues and policies can be an important way to shape voters’ behaviour. We test these questions using geocoded data on voting and bike commuting behaviour in France from 2007-2020. We first explore the association between these two behaviours. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we test how political elites can influence voters’ environmentally-friendly behaviour: If they do so through cueing mechanisms or through policies such as building new bike lanes. In additional analyses, we explore the individual level mechanisms of the link between environmentally-friendly and voting behaviours. Overall, these results are important for our understanding of the relationship between the individual-level behaviours of citizens and climate policy-making.

While we can observe the political repercussions of this transformation, it remains unclear whether this political divide is underpinned by individual perceptions of economic and social inequalities. Do new left and radical right voters indeed evaluate social inequalities as most important and politicized? Or do they link economic and social concerns more closely than the socio-cultural polarization of this divide may suggest at first glance? Which inequalities are central to these groups and which are perceived as neglected by politics? Drawing on an original survey fielded in Germany in 2022, we show that both highly and less educated voters place strong emphasis on both economic and social inequalities. Low educated voters, in particular, place more emphasis on the importance of socioeconomic differences, but feel that politics is not sufficiently addressing them. Understanding how voters link economic and social inequalities is relevant to better understand policy demands and responsiveness.

Explaining working-class votes for the meritocracy	Meritocratic beliefs are consequential in explaining support for redistribution, yet we still know little of why working-class individuals buy into the rhetoric of meritocracy despite low levels of upward mobility. To differentiate among competing explanations related to a lack of alternatives, aspirational beliefs, or a psychological benefit, I complement cross-sectional time series with a survey experiment. The design makes participants choose between class and merit-based political rhetoric. By asking participants to state their preference, associating the rhetoric with policy content, and measuring the effect on social identity, the experiment will show if working-class participants prefer a merit-based discourse to a class-based one when given an alternative, and clarify the mechanism through which this happens.

We advance two competing theoretical arguments: On the one hand, psychological theories of class conflict assume that inequality accentuates perceptions of individual economic positions, leading to more pronounced class identifications among both low- and high-income people. Consequently, resentment and animosity towards the out-group will increase and affective polarization between the rich and the poor intensifies. On the other hand, since inequality diminishes the material status of the lower socioeconomic classes, political economists hypothesize that rising levels of economic inequality will decrease the class identity among the poor. Consequently, affective polarization should be reduced. To test these expectations empirically, we conduct survey experiments in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Respondents are treated with different information on the countries overall level of economic inequality as well as their own position in the income distribution. The results will show to what extent inequality affects hostility between low- and high-income people, thereby undermining mutual respect and dialogue, which are some of the cornerstones of well-functioning democracies.

Evidence from a survey experiment in Britiain	Do people like social groups because of their political opinions, or do people like political opinion-based camps due to the social group associated with that opinion? Answering this question is important for understanding the sources of political and social conflicts. We build a theoretical model of why opinion-based and social group-based polarization are connected. We test our theoretical assumptions with a survey experiment in Britain. The opinion-based identities we address are rooted in the universalist-nationalist cleavage, namely immigration and the environment. The social group we focus on is the working class, a group of considerable salience in the British context. When self-identifying working class members are informed that the working class is the majority in one of the opinion-based camps, working class respondents feel closer towards the camp for which the working class was shown to be the majority supporter. However, respondents feel more distant from the working class when they perceive that the working class is the majority in their opposing opinion-based camp. Our results offer a novel perspective on how socio-structural identities are linked to post-materialist opinion-based camps.

French presidents over time have strikingly similar experiences in terms of popularity: a peak after the election soon followed by a process of erosion. This “cost of ruling” pattern is particularly strong in the Fifth Republic, facilitated by the concentration of power in the hands of presidents, making them the person to blame. Cost of ruling tends to dominate other possible drivers of popularity and hinders the president’s capacity to benefit from good economic conditions. This changes only during cohabitations, when presidents and prime ministers are of different parties or coalitions: power sharing makes the president more popular and better able to gain from good economic performance. Our analyses also reveal that this cost of ruling has increased over time: in the early years of the Fifth Republic presidents enjoyed consistently higher levels of popularity, but this is no longer the case.

As regards the role of the economy, we show that it still is a crucial predictor of approval ratings in Spain, but also provide evidence that its influence has fluctuated over time. As regards non-economic factors, we find that the salience of terrorism is strongly associated with positive approval ratings in Spain. Similarly, congruence between mass preferences and government ideology results in higher approval ratings. By contrast, when mass preferences deviate from the incumbent’s ideology, the popularity of the latter deteriorates, which might ultimately result in electoral turnover. Our study suggests that the economy continues to be a crucial factor behind government popularity in Spain, but also uncovers the role of other contextual factors like issue salience and mass preferences, which have received much less attention so far.

Then we turn to the country case study chapters in this volume, characterizing them according to Lijphart’s (1971) case study typology: theory-confirming, theory-infirming, hypothesis-generating, and deviant case studies. Ten of the 11 case studies are categorized as fully or partially confirming. Additionally, a few of these can also be considered hypothesis-generating or deviant in that they provide new insights regarding the role of inequality, government responsiveness, and economic measures, topics that deserve further study. In the closing section, we discuss additional avenues for further research such as how the pandemic, climate change, migration, and threats to democracy may impact executive approval ratings in the future.

This chapter re-examines the economics-politics relationship in cross-national perspective. Returning to Paldam’s instability dilemma, we address two questions. First, are the factors identified as drivers of approval in individual country studies replicated in a pooled popularity function? Second, do cross-country differences in political context, issue salience, and political dispositions interfere, facilitate, or otherwise condition the economics-politics connection? Multivariate analyses of approval across 20 countries from the 1990s through 2019 show that the economy-popularity relationship varies across both time and space. While the magnitude of the economy’s effect has on average diminished since the turn of the 21st Century, the change is much more pronounced in some countries than in others, and in some nations, its effect has even increased.

Citizens living in relatively deprived places are assumed to feel left behind by globalization and politics, which, in turn, decreases their feeling of societal recognition and makes them more susceptible to radical-right parties. However, this two-step mechanism has rarely been tested directly since previous studies often focused either on the attitudinal level or on aggregate-level effects. This paper examines whether the individuals’ living place affects the feeling of lacking societal recognition and hence, contributes to radical-right voting. The study focuses on Germany as a particularly interesting case because of previous inconclusive empirical evidence regarding the effects of regional inequalities. Geocoded survey data is used to analyze the relationship between living in a ‘left behind place’ and the subjective ‘feeling of being left behind’ by relying on fine-grained measures of living conditions and an original measurement of perceived societal recognition. Subsequently, the analyses focus on the relation of lacking societal recognition and voting behavior as well as the underlying mediation model.

Place-based consciousness is defined as a strong identification with one’s place of living plus feelings of hostility towards out-groups who are perceived to look down on the in-group and keep the in-group from receiving its fair share of public resources. I argue that place-based consciousness determines how candidates from different political parties and backgrounds are perceived, and subsequently, which candidate is chosen by the citizen. By using experimental data from a conjoint experiment together with an extensive measure of place-based consciousness, I can show that it does influence candidate choices of German voters. The results suggest that place-based identities and grievances not only exist in Germany, but can also play a pivotal role in voting behaviour.

While Switzerland exhibits a large rural-urban divide in the quarterly votes, it has not yet been researched whether there exists also a divide in political trust. Evidence from the European context points to a geographical component of political trust with rural residents being less trusting, as they feel left behind their urban counterparts. On the other hand, the design of the Swiss political system and the country's small-scale nature suggest no divide. I investigate the Swiss rural-urban divide in trust in the government, the parliament, the justice system and politicians using an original data set from September 2022. Results reveal a significant but irrelevantly small divide. The key to the absence of such a divide might lie in place-based identity. When interacting place-based identity with place of living, it reveals that rural residents exhibit higher levels of political trust than urban residents when place-based identity is low, while trust is higher in urban than in rural places for high levels of identity.

After several decades at the margins of cleavage politics, a growing body of literature has diagnosed a return of geography, pointing towards an increasingly polarized conflict between cities and the countryside. While existing studies have highlighted important differences in political behavior between urban and rural dwellers, how this conflict actually manifests itself in peoples’ minds remains largely unexplored. Crucially, this leaves the precise mechanisms that make place politically divisive unclear. Combining open-ended survey questions with a conjoint experiment fielded in nine European countries, this paper sheds light on the prevalent stereotypes individuals associate with people living in urban and rural areas. Expecting that individuals particularly stereotype ruralites as nationalists and urbanites as cosmopolitans, the results of this analysis have important implications for our understanding of how geography underpins existing political conflicts.

Recent studies highlight that voters often “follow the leader”, by aligning their opinions with those of their favourite political leaders. Yet, even in polarized societies, there are instances in which voters take positions that contrast with party positions, such as in referendum campaigns. In this study, I argue that after voting in a referendum, a relevant share voters “follow the issue” and change party preferences to accommodate issue preferences. I test this argument with cross-sectional and panel data related to four referendums in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Results show that support for parties changes substantially following referendum results in each country, with some voters “switching” to the parties that are aligned with their own position on the referendum proposals, although ideological distance between voters and parties moderates vote switching. Additional evidence from a survey experiment addresses potential issues of reverse causality and confirms that voters increase support for parties that share their own issue preferences.

These effects are long-lasting and their strength varies across individuals in a predictable manner. We exploit issue-specific campaigns before direct democratic votes at the ballot box which occur frequently in Switzerland. The estimation results show that direct democratic ballot votes have an effect on the attitudinal consistency of citizens, both in the short- and in the long-term: ballot votes more aligned with main dimension of conflict are associated with more consistent attitudes and this association persists across time. These findings have implications for normative and empirical research.

Specifically, we bring together a unique rolling cross-section panel survey spanning five months before election day with data on media portrayals of intra-party strife. This allows us to trace over-time changes in voters’ perceptions of candidate image and party unity in an exceptionally fine-grained manner. Our analysis contributes a novel, agentic perspective to the literature on campaigning and provides new insights as to how elections are personalized in the minds of the voters.

In this paper, we examine to what extent the mode of fundraising, i.e., whether or not donations are made via fundraising events that facilitate personal contact between donors and politicians, may be driving these trends. We leverage novel data based on state-level campaign finance disclosures and individual-level Census data, as well as multiple nationally representative surveys to examine event- or non-event donors along a number of dimensions relevant for responsiveness and polarization. Preliminary results suggest that event donors are wealthier and donate more frequently than other donors. Moreover, they exhibit relatively centrist policy preferences. Further, event donors are better represented on an issue-by-issue basis by their members of Congress than either non-event donors or non-donors. The results speak to the effects of campaign finance on polarization and responsiveness. The results are consistent with event donors playing an important role in how campaign finance affects political outcomes.

In particular, I study the effect of the Smart Voting campaign; the latter was launched by Alexi Navalny with the aim to coordinate voting for the strongest opponents of the United Russia in single-member districts. I concentrate on two factors that influence opposition voters’ behavior: the image of incumbent party invincibility and the ideological distance between a voter and the main contender of the dominant party on a ballot. To test my hypotheses, I run a conjoint survey experiment (n = 481) in the second-largest Russian city - Saint-Petersburg - in the run-up to the 2021 State Duma election in September 2021. The results strongly support the hypothesis about ideological distance, while evidence for the effect of the image of invincibility is very weak: respondents presented with information emphasizing the challenges the United Russia faced in the election do not seem to vote more strategically than those from the control group.

One is an original data set created from collections at the National Archives involving the Congressional Seed Distribution, a Department of Agriculture program that allowed MCs to send packets of plant seed to constituents at taxpayer expense, serving primarily advertising purposes. The other is a dataset drawn from the pension records of Civil War veterans. I employ these data to directly identify and analyze MC interactions with and actions on behalf of constituents. Additionally, the chapter traces macro-level changes in constituency service, linking them to the broader system-level changes that lie at the heart of the theoretical account advanced in the book. I show the effect that developments such as the professionalization of the bureaucracy and the electoral reforms that tied MCs more directly to voters rather than local party leaders had on the internal organization of Congress and the activities of its members.

While it has often been debated in the literature whether PID really is an """"""""unmoved mover"""""""" or subject to feedback effects from the political performance of party candidates or their issue positions, this discussion has usually focussed on the national level. We complement this perspective in two ways: first, by looking at feedback effects that originate at the level of individual US states, and second, by looking at the socialisation effects of the partisanship of presidents and state governors. Using multilevel ordinal logit modelling applied to cumulated American Election Study data from 1958 to 1992, we show that even after controlling for parental PID and other predictors, the party not only of the US president but also of the state governor experienced during adolescence and early adulthood affects the formation of PID.

As feminism gains visibility in political and media agendas, it could be expected to work as a source cue similar to ideological or party identities. We use three experimental studies to test whether providing people with a feminist cue (information about feminists endorsing policy positions) affects where people stand on those issues, contingent on people’s attitudes towards feminism. Experiments are run in different countries (UK and Spain), deal with different issues (gender violence, surrogate pregnancies, gender quotas, and the use of niqabs and burkas) and vary on whether or not they offer frames and party cues together with feminist cues. We find that there are no significant cue effects for feminism. The paper discusses the reasons why, although feminism may refer to a bunch of highly salient gender issues, it does not work as a social identity that conditions where people position themselves in terms of policy options.

Far right voting is often explained as a counter-reaction to cultural change, including to feminism. Given the aims of feminism, men should feel more threatened by feminism than women, which could explain their higher likelihood to vote for an anti-feminist far right party. However, individuals’ perceptions of feminism as a threat have seldom been measured in their own right. Using novel survey data on the case of Spain, we find that, contrary to expectations, women feel more threatened by feminism than men. The effect holds for material, symbolic, egotropic and sociotropic threat perceptions. We develop and test two mediation hypotheses to explain this finding. First, women generally have higher levels of threat perceptions and anxiety than men regarding various issues, including feminism. Second, women spend more time on house and care work, which they may not consider as adequately valued by feminism. Our results support these hypotheses, controlling for various factors, including party identification and feminist self-identification. The study confirms the ambivalent nature of social perceptions of feminism and highlights the difficulties of feminism in achieving large support among women.

Little is known about what this constitutive change has triggered regarding women’s attitudes, this research aims at filling this gap. I aim to capture the effect of female enfranchisement on women’s political and feminist attitudes at the individual level by drawing on research that focuses on the influence of impressionable years and research that contends that political opinions form throughout youth. This goal is challenging since, once women's voting rights are assured, the entire female population is treated, making it challenging to identify an appropriate counterfactual. Furthermore, it is challenging to disentangle between different causal paths. I attempt to overcome this issue using the case of the Spanish Second Republic. This case allows identifying and analysing those women who voted up until two times, lost their suffrage during the Franco regime, and regained it after democratisation. Hence, it captures not only the legacies of acquiring suffrage but also the consequences of losing it and living under a gender-based authoritarian regime.

New research explores the impact of the U.S. Women’s March on women's descriptive representation. Yet, for a worldwide phenomenon, we ignore how the effect of feminist mobilizations on political representation travels to multiparty systems. This paper sheds light on this by focusing on the 2018 and 2019 Women’s Day protests in Spain, which gathered around five million people and witnessed unprecedented female mobilizations. Combining geographical data on protests and administrative data on candidate lists at the municipal level, we explore the effects of Women’s Day mobilizations on the selection of female politicians. Taking advantage of the intensity and geographic variation, we use a difference-in-differences design to examine protests' effects on party nominations of female candidates, their positioning on the lists - either as a front-runner or a second – and the mechanisms behind this. This paper contributes to the literature on social movements and political representation by presenting novel evidence on the different strategies that parties may incur when facing the salience of feminist movements.

As mixed gender environments increase, how can we expect them to affect gender norms? To answer this question, we focus on the effects of the introduction of mixed gender education. We collect data on education reforms in European countries that enabled male and female coeducation. We then merge these data with individual-level data from the European Social Survey. To estimate the effect of coeducation on gender norms, we run regression discontinuity designs that compare cohorts nearly affected and nearly not affected by the reforms. Our findings suggest that coeducation had no effect on men’s views of gender equality, but it made women more conservative when it comes to female labor participation. Our results have implications for the set of policies that work, and do not work, for female empowerment and gender equality in advanced industrial democracies.

Resilient or simply unaddressed by far-right parties?	Being considered the losers of technological change, male industrial workers have turned to support far-right parties. Yet, although “female” routine occupations such as office clerks have shrunk similarly, female routine workers have not voted for the far-right as frequently as their male counterparts. The dominating explanation for this gendered voting pattern is a greater societal status loss among male routine workers. Our paper tests an alternative explanation, namely that male and female routine workers have been unequally addressed by far-right parties. Therefore, we ask the following question: Is the effect of technological change on far-right voting for female workers moderated by far-right parties? While most studies analyze national dynamics of party competition, research suggests that parties adjust their political campaigns to the local context. We test our theoretical arguments with a measure of local party strategy which is constructed from politicians’ social media data in Germany. These data are combined with GSOEP data and the established routine task intensity index and EU KLEMS data on ICT usage within industries as measures of technological change.

Evidence From a 20-Country Conjoint Study	Due to the persistent underrepresentation of women in politics around the world, it would be logical to conclude that citizens discriminate against women running for office. However, the empirical evidence of gender bias is mixed. Whereas early research suggested that men do outperform women in the electoral sphere more recent work suggests that women and men perform equally well once party and incumbency are controlled for. Furthermore, most existing work is conducted in the United States or a select few other Western nations. To evaluate whether citizens prefer male leaders, we conducted a 20-country comparative study, employing a conjoint design asking participants to choose between political candidates varying on characteristics such as gender, occupational background, age, number of children etc. The design allows us to estimate the average effect of gender on candidate preference, while simultaneously measuring effects of other relevant candidate attributes. Additionally, we test the potential moderating effect of macro-level variables like current levels of women’s representation in parliament, as well as the moderating effect of respondent-level variables such as sexist attitudes and political ideology.

One driver of this gap is that children’s experiences with domestic labor might be gendered. This raises the question whether interventions that familiarize both young men and women with some of the basics of housework, such as home economics classes in school, can increase their contribution to housework later in their lives and thereby reduce the domestic labor gender gap. We shed new light on this question by leveraging the quasi-random variation in home economics classes across Swiss gymnasiums. Due to budget cuts, home economics classes were cut in some schools in 2004, and reintroduced after a popular initiative a few years later. Drawing on a survey and student registry information about where and when respondents graduated from gymnasium, we compare self-reported housework time of students who went to gymnasium between 1999 and 2018 with and without home economics. Initial findings indicate that home economics classes reduce the domestic labor gender gap. These causal effects underscore the importance of this educational intervention for gender equality.

One is the effect of geographic circumstances on voters. Through the rural-urban divide, researchers try to understand the factors that make rural voters more likely to vote for the far-right, linking them in most cases, to the consequences of globalization. However, little attention has been paid to cultural circumstances that are stable for generations in these areas. This paper fills this gap by using an innovative perspective: the effect of historical legacies in an unexplored case like Spain. The lack of industrialization and the support for Frente Nacional during the Second Republic in agrarian rural areas helped maintain traditional values that explain the vote for VOX nowadays. The mixed-methods approach of this paper, using both new municipal-level historical data and qualitative interviews, allows us to understand how the transmission of values has been made through generations. Results support the main hypothesis of the paper: Rural-agrarian voters who live in a municipality that supported FN during the Second Republic have a higher probability to support VOX nowadays.

Initiatives commemorating past atrocities often aim to affect political behavior in support of democracy and pluralism in the present. Yet, little empirical evidence exists whether that happens. In this study, we examine if exposure to local memorials that commemorate victims of atrocities reduces support for far-right parties. Our empirical case is the Stolpersteine counter-memorial in Berlin, Germany. It commemorates victims and survivors of Nazi persecution in front of their last freely chosen place of residence. We employ various analytical strategies from time-series cross-sectional analyses to a discontinuity design using a novel panel dataset that matches the location and date of placement of new Stolpersteine with election results from seven elections (2013-2021) at the level of polling station areas. We find that, on average, the presence of Stolpersteine is associated with a 0.96%-point decrease in the far-right vote share in the following election. Our study suggests that counter-memorials reduce local far-right support. The finding demonstrates how social representations of history can impact political behavior in the present.

After the Second World War, millions of Germans were questioned about their political past by courts. I document how denazification shaped the emerging political landscape in postwar Germany. Using three sources of plausibly exogenous variation in the extent of denazification, I find that denazification reduced the demand for nationalist politics. This difference is observed in neighboring and otherwise similar municipalities (i) across Allied occupation zones, (ii) across court-districts, and (iii) within districts. Tracing the effect over time, support for nationalist politics moves as party platforms evolve.

This paper aims to improve our understanding of how different framings of historical guilt and continued responsibility influence citizens’ views of the past, attitudes to outgroups, and voting decisions. It relies on a survey experiment based on a nationally representative sample in which respondents are exposed to vignettes outlining different framings of guilt and continued responsibility for the Holocaust. The vignette texts are adapted from excerpts of speeches by Holocaust survivors and politicians from across the political spectrum on Germany’s culture of memory and the need to remember. Exploring how citizens react to these different narratives will help us to analyse how different societal narratives, policies, and political contexts interact with individual characteristics in shaping reactions to different framings of historical guilt and continued responsibility and make citizens susceptibly to revisionist accounts relativizing the past, for example by radical right parties.

Previous studies use case-study designs of limited generalizability and have not directly studied how events affect everyday political engagement. This investigation tackles these issues by conducting a quantitative comparative investigation on event’s impacts on everyday political engagement. Through exhaustive historiographical analysis, I identify 43 eventful periods for 5 West European countries across the twentieth-century. Using the results of 360 statistical models analyzing 30 years of survey data, I assess the empirical association between cohort-level variables of historical exposure to each of these events and interpersonal political discussion, a behavioral measure of daily political engagement. I find that most events are significant predictors of political discussion, but they are heterogeneous in the magnitude and direction of the impacts they exert. Using an original database on events characteristics, I identify associations between these heterogeneities and the recency, transformative nature, and rallying capacity of an event, and introduce theoretical propositions aimed at understanding these previously uncharted associations.

This investigation seeks to shed light on this issue. I argue that due to age and socioeconomic differences in political interest and the degree to which people use environmental cues for political inference making, historical events produce effects on political engagement that are segmented across the life cycle: they are large and socioeconomically equalizing for young adults, and moderate and unequalizing for other ages. I find empirical support for this hypothesis by analyzing variations between West Germany and France in how age and socioeconomic attributes performed as regressors of interpersonal political discussion, a behavioral indicator of daily political engagement, before and during German Reunification (Nov ’89-Dec-’90). I develop and use an original quantitative indicator of historical contingency to show this comparison approximates quasi-experimental conditions that tackle validity issues that remain pervasive in even-based research.

However, research also highlights that when people are reminded of past and current atrocities, they feel helpless as what they can do is limited. In this well-powered field-in-the-lab experiment in Germany, we will examine the effects of real-world intervention where people contribute to building an online archive about the victims of Nazi persecution. Taking action related to the atrocities increases participative self-efficacy and intentions to mobilize for a society free of prejudice. In addition to a pure control condition, we also compare our treatment to an exposure to past atrocities condition. This way we can highlight the importance of giving people options to take actions related to atrocities in addition to reminding them about the atrocities so that intergroup relations are improved. This research has critical implications for the literature on political mobilization and prejudice reduction.

While there is a burgeoning literature on the long-term impact of socialization under authoritarian regimes on a range of democratic, economic and left-right views, we know less about its impact on attitudes to socio-cultural issues. I theorize that exposure to communist regimes is likely to reinforce social conformity (particularly in contexts of high levels of past repression), which should in turn generate over the longer-term greater social conservatism, including more opposition to foreigners and less support for gender equality norms. I test this hypothesis using attitudinal data from the World Values Study and the European Social Survey, coupled with indicators from the V-DEM dataset and World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Preliminary results provide partial support for these theoretical claims. The findings from this study can contribute to our understanding of the long-term determinants of attitudes to socio-cultural issues in Europe.

This paper examines the effect of cross-party contact on the content of political discussion using a lab-in-the-field experiment in Britain. Building on insights from social psychology, we argue that people discussing politics with likeminded partisans will be more emotive, whereas cross-partisan discussions will encourage greater use of perspective-taking and reason. We test these propositions by randomly assigning partisans to discuss a divisive political policy with either co-partisans or out-partisans in a non-deliberative discussion setting. Using supervised machine learning to analyse the discussion content, we find that people taking part in cross-party group discussions are less likely to use negative emotive rhetoric and more likely to engage with the evidence and argument. These findings demonstrate the ways in which cross-party discussion enable people to discuss even divisive political issues in a reasoned manner.

In a pre-registeredfield experiment, we recruited high-school students in 18 schools in Poland and randomly assigned them to either a debating workshop or a control condition. Beforeand after the workshop period, we asked students to indicate their belief in a set ofnews headlines (half of which were true, half false) and also measured their degree ofconspiratorial thinking. We find that debating increases the accuracy of beliefs regardingnews headlines, while reducing conspiracy thinking. These findings point to a greatpotential of school debating, which occurs naturally in many educational contexts and iseasily scalable.

Beforeand after the workshop period, we asked students to indicate their belief in a set ofnews headlines (half of which were true, half false) and also measured their degree ofconspiratorial thinking. We find that debating increases the accuracy of beliefs regardingnews headlines, while reducing conspiracy thinking. These findings point to a greatpotential of school debating, which occurs naturally in many educational contexts and iseasily scalable.

And to what extent does partisanship drive the formation of social relationships? These dynamics are intertwined: exposure to heterogeneous social networks may prevent outpartisan hate, however, especially in a highly polarized political climate, individuals may proactively avoid interactions with outparty members, thus reducing their exposure to alternative viewpoints. To answer these questions, we ran a two-wave survey coupled with several experiments in the US. The survey measures outpartisan hate and the amount of close and casual relationships individuals have with outpartisans. It also conducts three tests to measure network selection: a pairwise comparison, a conjoint experiment and a competence game. Exploiting the November 2022 House Elections as an exogenous source of partisanship, we compare the same participants’ answers between polarized and calm political times. Preliminary findings show that participants in both close and casual heterogeneous networks are indeed less polarized than those in homogeneous networks. They are also less driven by partisanship in their selection of social relationships. These findings suggest that interpartisan animosity can be contained when outpartisans interact and form relationships.

Despite decades of scholarship suggesting the critical influence of identities establishing the causal effect of identities on political preferences is extremely difficult because identities are -- either by choice or external force -- endogenous. We examine the causal relationship between identity and political preferences through a countrywide natural experiment in Thailand on the basis of Thailand's color identities, which are exogenously assigned at birth. We conducted two large-scale surveys in Thailand that allowed us to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous sources of color identification. We find a statistically significant effect of endogenous identities on political attachments and choices. However, we do not find a statistically significant effect of the same color identity when this is derived exogenously. This study serves as a clean test of exogenous identities on political preferences in a real-world political setting and sheds light on the theoretical and empirical relevance of distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous identities for politics.

By sending cues of improved deliberation in the interest of social groups within society, descriptive representation affects how well voters perceive themselves represented by these institutions and how fair they perceive the process of decision-making. For instance, the degree to which women are represented signals improved deliberation in the interest of women to voters (male and female). Previous studies have investigated the effect of descriptive representation on perceptions of representation and procedures. However, in sum, empirical findings remain inconclusive. They do not allow us to answer the question of when and why descriptive representation is relevant for evaluations of institutions. I answer these questions by connecting theories of representation and group identity theory. The degree to which voters feel subjective group belonging and status they perceive these groups to have within society predicts how they perceive and process collective descriptive representation. To test this, I collect original survey data, incl an online conjoint experiment, in Germany and UK.

However, intergroup contact does not occur in a vacuum — even if that is rarely made explicit. Rather it is typically embedded in an institutional environment in which support of positive intergroup interactions is low, high or a mixture of both. Allport, the father of intergroup contact theory, postulated that “the effect of contact is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional support (i.e., by law, custom, or local atmosphere)”, and the few existing studies on the topic suggest that he was right. This study examines the role of authority support from various institutions in intergroup contact (i.e., government, business, and church) through a priming experiment and a conjoint experiment in the US. The results highlight the importance of authority support for participating in intergroup contact events and perceptions of the effectiveness of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice. This study contributes to the literature on the necessary conditions for intergroup contact to be effective.

Previous studies already demonstrated that the explanation models underlying individual voting participation are the same across immigrant-origin and native voters, but could not explain why the turnout gap between both groups persists. This paper integrates theoretical notions of explanations for turnout and identifies three central explanations for these group differences: (a) socialisation experiences (immigrant-origin voters are less socialised into political activity when their parents are less integrated politically), (b) resources (immigrant-origin voters have fewer resources that matter for voting, such as education, political knowledge) and (c) mobilisation (parties mobilise voters differently). Using a novel data set from the IMGES II, conducted in the city of Duisburg during the 2021 Bundestag election, we test a three-phase model of the political life cycle on random samples of immigrant-origin groups and natives. We find differences between voters for all three phases, during the time of politically coming of age, the period of cumulating relevant resources and, finally, during the run-up to the election through exposure to mobilizing efforts by parties.

While there has been much debate about the financial cost of such schemes, little attention has been paid to their effect on parliamentary effort. We propose a model that captures the two main features of life pension schemes: i) the pension amount increases with seniority, and ii) age determines parliamentarians' eligibility. Our model highlights heterogeneous incentives to exert parliamentarian effort: introducing a life pension decreases effort of eligible parliamentarians with high seniority and increases the effort of all other parliamentarians. We test this model using the introduction of the life pension in Italy in 1955 where the eligibility of parliamentarians depends on their age and the amount accumulated depends on their seniority. Our empirical results show that the prospects of accumulating a higher pension stimulates parliamentarians to exert more effort, especially when parliamentarians are not eligible. In contrast, eligible parliamentarians face a trade-off between accumulating further benefits or enjoying the life pension straight away. Senior eligible parliamentarians decrease their effort while all other parliamentarians maintain or increase their effort.

The family is the sphere where people most frequently interact across generations and personal experiences in this context can influence support for other - and future – generations. However, the role of family ties in fostering inter-generational solidarity has rarely been studied within public opinion research, especially not in causal-oriented studies. This paper investigate solidarity with future generations, specifically related to climate action and long-term sustainability of the welfare state, among middle-aged and old adults, and how family relations to grandchildren inform such opinions. It does so using a large-scale survey experiment priming familial roles to different degrees, fielded among a representative sample of people aged 55 or older in Denmark. The paper contributes with knowledge on the link between family ties and inter-generational solidarity and, most importantly, with causal evidence for whether family ties matter for willingness to prioritise solving long-term issues.

A transition to a more sustainable energy efficient region with the goal of creating more jobs to combat unemployment is depicted in the Regional Policy Direction, a five year plan from 2019-2024. Literature on regionalism is becoming more prevalent regarding the discussion of post-industrial regions and new economic projects with the goal of becoming more autonomous. Will economic advancement plans trigger a growing support for more regional autonomy in Wallonia? This discussion aims to address the less obvious and more compelling Walloon case of regionalism as Belgian regional conflict has been historically and currently centered around the region of Flanders with the dominant far-right party Vlaams Belang calling for Belgian succession and autonomy from Wallonia.

Proposed answers are far-reaching. Yet in recent years cautionary voices have become louder: not all relations between material circumstances and political attitudes can be interpreted as a direct consequence of these circumstances. This is because (1) pre-adult experiences with socio-economic disadvantage, (2) shocks early in individuals' labour market trajectories, as well as (3) exposure to economic risks throughout individuals' labour market trajectories can impact the attitudes of those who experience an economic shock, next to (4) the shock itself. This article highlights the need to disentangle these processes theoretically and empirically. In theoretical terms, these four processes differ regarding the underlying models of political socialization over the life-cycle. The analyses highlight the crucial role of labour market experiences early in life - process 2) - since only younger age groups adjust their redistributive attitudes in response to unemployment. These results stem from age group specific analyses of the Dutch LISS panel from 2008 to 2021 using traditional and more advanced fixed effects models that control for time-constant and dynamic unemployment risk factors.

We show that this effect is driven by those who own their house outright, whereas homeowners with a mortgage are more similar to renters, reflecting the pressure of mortgage payments counteracting the insurance function. We furthermore investigate experimentally whether informing respondents about house price inequality or overall wealth inequality affects their efficacy. Our pre-registered hypotheses stipulate that learning about high inequality should reduce efficacy. However, the information treatments show no effect, suggesting that political efficacy is not easily manipulated with information about inequality.

In doing so, we distinguish two crucial stages of socialization: during post-secondary education and on the job, and we adjudicate when class differences in political preferences become more marked and consolidated. Are class preferences a direct consequence of individuals’ economic prospects and experiences on the job?

We elaborate on the conceptual differences between the processes of selection and socialization, and address these questions empirically using UK and Swiss panel data. Our first analyses focusing on socialization in the job and entrance into a class location provide little support for socialization at this stage, as class differences in issue positions are often at least as large prior to entering occupation.

However, educational expansion and changing occupational structures have also created opportunities for upward mobility among younger professionals – unprecedentedly so for women. This paper studies how men and women make sense of upward mobility (in combination with societal trends around them) and how this influences their political attitudes and behavior. We explore the importance of different reference points for men and women (e.g. comparisons to mother’s versus father’s/parents’ status), whether they interpret labor market success differently, and how upward social mobility may differentially relate to political attitudes (including gender-related ones) for men and women. Empirically, we draw on multiple original surveys fielded in various European countries between 2021 and 2023, which include objective and subjective measures of social mobility as well as attitudinal and electoral outcomes. If upward mobility differentially shapes the politics of (younger, educated) men and women, this may be a key element to ongoing changes in the electoral dynamics across advanced democracies.

However, educational expansion and changing occupational structures have also created opportunities for upward mobility among younger professionals – unprecedentedly so for women. This paper studies how men and women make sense of upward mobility (in combination with societal trends around them) and how this influences their political attitudes and behavior. We explore the importance of different reference points for men and women (e.g. comparisons to mother’s versus father’s/parents’ status), whether they interpret labor market success differently, and how upward social mobility may differentially relate to political attitudes (including gender-related ones) for men and women.

We put forward another explanation: Massive population losses in these areas imply that many voters who would have been least likely to support anti-system parties have left, leaving behind increasingly disaffected remainers. We exploit the natural experiment of German reunification, after which 16 million eastern Germans were suddenly free to move to wealthier western Germany, to show that large net outflows of population predict high levels of populist radical right support. Using unique administrative data as well as panel survey data, we estimate to what extent this pattern is due to those who left being politically different from those who stayed and those who stayed changing their political attitudes as a result. We conclude that if leavers had remained, the vote share obtained by the populist radical right in those regions would have been substantially lower.

Advocates of such policies argue that they are likely to reduce spatial disparities that caused radical right support in more economically deprived areas. However, little is known about whether, and if so how, such policies affect political attitudes and behaviour. This paper aims to assess the impact of urban regeneration policies on individuals’ political interest, sense of external efficacy, political participation and/or party identification. To do so, we focus on the ‘Social City Programme’ in Germany which is an urban regeneration policy that combines economic investment and social cohesion projects to boost local economies and increase civic and political engagement. The German panel data allows us to compare various political attitudes and behaviour of individuals that receive this programme with similar individuals that did not receive it since its implementation in 1999. This paper provides important insights into whether place-based policies are successful at promoting political participation and curbing anti-mainstream support.

In this research note, we shed new light on this question by estimating the geographic scope at which the local presence of refugees affects voting behavior. Focusing on Germany in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis, we combine precinct-level electoral returns with the geocoded street addresses of refugee housing facilities. Using a difference-in-differences design within large cities, we show that refugee exposure sharply increased far-right voting among citizens living in close proximity to refugees. However, these effects are highly localized: on average, no substantive effect can be detected among voters living 300 meters or more from refugee accommodation. We further establish the generalizability of this pattern across German municipalities using census grid data. Our findings demonstrate how the substantive conclusions of quasi-experimental designs can be affected by the geographic level at which treatment exposure is measured.

The Spatial Dynamics of Anti-Establishment Support	The strong and rising support for populist radical parties has caused upheavals across European political landscapes. Most studies to date, however, have focused on the ascendance of populist radical right (RR) parties, overlooking other expressions of mainstream party disaffection and abandonment, especially on the radical left (RL). Specifically, despite growing interest in geographic divides in support for radical anti-establishment parties, prior research has predominantly examined the local contexts under which voters turn to the RR. Our study deepens understanding of the conditions under which populist anti-establishment sentiments translate into support for the RR in some localities and the RL in others. We advance a structural economic argument to explain how space and place structure support for RR and RL parties. We posit that what distinguishes RR from RL strongholds and voters is their relative economic and labor market conditions and how they evolve over time. To make our case, we turn to France - a country with long-standing presence of radical parties - and examine the dynamics of electoral support for RR and RL candidates in French presidential elections between 1995 - 2022.

Utilizing group threat theory, this article examines the effects of increased media coverage on realistic and symbolic threat perceptions towards immigration, and whether effects may differ by socioeconomic status. I first evaluate the frequency of media coverage of migration using the MigPress corpus of German newspapers. Using mixed multilevel models, this data is linked with longitudinal information on the salience of the migration topic from the German Socio-Economic Panel and greater detail on perceptions of symbolic and realistic threat from the European Social Survey. Results demonstrate that while media salience increases concerns about immigration, these concerns are mainly due to symbolic rather than realistic threat perceptions, indicating that the relationship between economic concerns and anti-immigration attitudes may be overrated. Media coverage increases concerns most for the highest social classes, possibly because they consume more newspaper content. These findings bring us a step closer towards better understanding how media coverage can affect the attitudes of social groups in divergent ways.

National Identity, Vote Choice, and Mass Media: Evidence from Germany.	National identity has been suspected to explain far-right vote choices. Paradoxically, while national identity is rather stable and latent, far-right voting is far more volatile. The `activation hypothesis’ offers an explanation for how identities become behaviorally relevant. It is assumed that right-wing political elites in particular exploit the increasing salience of migration-related public discourses in their campaigns and thus activate national identities for electoral decision-making. Arguably, the mere presence of migration-related news in the mass media may serve as a situational trigger for thinking about national in-group/out-group boundaries and thus increase the relevance of national identities for voting decisions. Drawing on Identity Theory and Social Identity Theory, I investigate whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through migration-related issue salience in mass media. In doing so, this paper is the first one to use panel survey data linked with media content to test this activation hypothesis for Germany.

The implication of our argument is that citizens are better informed about parties’ ideological positions in election time, but that this information effect is conditional on a free media environment. Using the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data and leveraging variation in the timing of interview-taking, we show that citizens are better informed about parties’ left-right positions close to election time. However, this effect only holds in high media freedom settings. Our findings draw attention to the important role that the information environment plays for voter perceptions.

Do people prefer protectionism or compensation when confronted with the distributional effects of trade? Central to the embedded liberalism thesis is that open economies will compensate citizens losing out as a consequence of competition from international trade. With political parties – particularly on the radical right – mobilising on protectionism, it is worth asking whether the compensation schemes of embedded liberalism can still work. This is particularly pressing because we know relatively little about the form citizens would prefer such compensation schemes to take. We expect people prefer protection over compensation if they personally lose from trade, but prefer compensation over protection if other people in society lose from trade. Our research design focuses on unique survey data from Germany, Ireland, Spain and Sweden in which we embed a pre-registered experiment that manipulates the scenarios surrounding increases in import flows and the steps politicians can take to address them. Our results illuminate the relative importance of education and region-specific import competition on preferences for political responses to international trade. This helps us to unpack the complexities beneath the trade protectionist/liberalization dichotomy.

Do people prefer protectionism or compensation when confronted with the distributional effects of trade? Central to the embedded liberalism thesis is that open economies will compensate citizens losing out as a consequence of competition from international trade. With political parties – particularly on the radical right – mobilising on protectionism, it is worth asking whether the compensation schemes of embedded liberalism can still work. This is particularly pressing because we know relatively little about the form citizens would prefer such compensation schemes to take. We expect people prefer protection over compensation if they personally lose from trade, but prefer compensation over protection if other people in society lose from trade. Our research design focuses on unique survey data from Germany, Ireland, Spain and Sweden in which we embed a pre-registered experiment that manipulates the scenarios surrounding increases in import flows and the steps politicians can take to address them. Our results illuminate the relative importance of education and region-specific import competition on preferences for political responses to international trade. This helps us to unpack the complexities beneath the trade protectionist/liberalization dichotomy.

We specifically focus the outbreak of the bacterium Xylella Fastidiosa in the Southern Italian region of Apulia, one of Europe's leading olive oil-producing region, in 2014 which exterminated centuries-old olive groves. By exploiting geographic variation in the spread of the disease and georeferenced municipal-level data, we use a difference-in-differences design to quantify the economic disruption associated with the spread of Xylella Fastidiosa and its electoral consequences. The disease generated an average loss of 1 per cent of yearly post-tax income per capita in infected municipalities. This economic disruption had important political consequences: far right parties gained an excess vote share of 3.7 percentage points in affected areas due to increases in turnout and an electoral loss of left parties. The vote shares of the regional incumbent, a large left-wing coalition responsible for managing the disaster and administering relief, remained unaffected. We combine a machine-learning approach and qualitative fieldwork in purposefully selected municipalities to identify the community- and individual-level mechanisms that underlie our findings.

Research has repeatedly shown that citizens tend to overestimate attitudinal divisions in society and between political camps. We propose that engaging in moral thinking—i.e., making judgments about whether other people are in the “right” or in the “wrong”—exacerbates misperceptions of division. This is so because the black-and-white logic of moral thinking leads individuals to experience diverging opinions as more fundamental and consequential. We study this hypothesis on the case of immigration; a topic considered to be highly polarizing. Embedding a survey experiment in countries with high and low levels of actual polarization around immigration, we randomly assign respondents to a question-as-treatment intended to trigger moral thinking about their attitudinal in- or out-group. We then examine whether the activation of moral thinking leads respondents to overestimate divisions around immigration in society. In addition, we examine whether activated moral thinking, through heightened (mis)perceptions of division, drives respondents to take more extreme immigration stances. The study contributes new knowledge on the consequences of moral judgments in politics and carries important implications for understanding the drivers of societal division.

However, little is known about the direction of this relationship: did polarization induce moral differentiation in political rhetoric or—vice versa—did changing moral rhetoric precede the growing partisan divide? We examine this question by leveraging a unique dataset containing all state-of-state speeches given by American governors on a yearly or bi-yearly basis since each given state entered the Union to explore the dynamic relationship between partisan polarization and elite moral rhetoric. Using these speeches has two advantages. First, covering a long time period enables us to explore temporal dynamics between polarization and moral rhetoric far beyond the scope of previous research. Secondly, they allow us to investigate how moral language itself has evolved in non-polarized contexts, which can provide important insights into potential scope conditions such as the role of economic development and inequality.

Voter Inferences from Candidate Affluence	This paper investigates how information about candidate affluence shapes voters’ decision-making at the ballot box. Challenging existing arguments that voters prefer affluent to low-income candidates on competence grounds, I argue that voters use information on affluence to infer candidate self-interest and evaluate the credibility of candidates’ policy promises on redistribution. I hypothesize that populist voters are particularly likely to rely on perceived self-interest as a heuristic for credibility. Evidence from a candidate-choice conjoint experiment lends partial support to my argument. While voters dislike affluent candidates for office across the board, populist voters are particularly reluctant to support wealthy pro-redistribution candidates. My findings help explain why widespread public support for greater redistribution need not translate into election victories for left parties.

Remarkably, moral identity has not received much attention in the study of voters' heterogeneous responses to politicians' immoral behavior. The cognitive accessibility of moral identity differs across voters. First of all, moral identity is more accessible to voters’ whose moral identity is more central to their self-definition. Second, situations can make voters’ moral identity more accessible. We conducted a set of survey embedded experiments to better understand the causal link between voters' moral identity and voters’ emotional and attitudinal response to politicians' immoral behavior. In these experiments we primed the cognitive accessibility of voter’s moral identity (and competing partisan identity) before exposure to information about politicians’ immoral behavior. Respondents whose moral self-schema were primed experienced more condemning moral emotions, evaluated the transgressor and the moral violation more negatively and showed less ingroup favoritism than respondents who were part of the control group.

Political scientists have long viewed values as a source of structure and constraint in political belief systems and, more recently, as a potential contributor to affective polarization. Some scholars have argued that moral values, in particular, have contributed to disagreement and hostility between partisan groups. Yet, there is little direct and systematic evidence as to which values are moralized. Using convenience samples of US-based respondents as well as a representative, probability-based sample of respondents from the AmeriSpeak panel at NORC, we examine the moralization levels of 21 values from three different value systems (moral foundations, Schwartz values, and political values). We show that there is meaningful overlap in value moralization between value systems and considerable variation in value moralization within value systems. Using conjoint experiments, we also show that these differences in value moralization matter, with more moralized values driving stronger social polarization. Our paper contributes to the literatures on values, morality, and polarization by comprehensively examining the relationship between values and morality and how they jointly shape polarization.

Scholars have long tried to identify the factors leading citizens to form coherent political belief systems. While extensive research explores how distinct social groups differ in degree of attitude organization, relatively little attention has been given to the possibility that particularities of political systems may affect belief system coherence. Using network analysis to model political beliefs systems based on large, representative surveys conducted across 39 European countries (the European Social Surveys), I show that belief system coherence exhibits both substantial and systematic cross-national diversity. My second contribution stems from investigating why differences in belief system organization emerge at the country level in the first place. In particular, I examine hypotheses related to elite incentives to transmit ideologically coherent information and conditions that enhance citizen demand for such information. I find belief systems to be more coherent in countries with greater party-system institutionalization, stronger programmatic citizen-party linkages, and deeper party ideological polarization.

We aim to address which of these has the largest effect on trust judgements. We do so through conjoint experiments in five countries, which indicates broad agreement that benevolence, followed equally by integrity and competence, are the primary determinants of trust judgements. In other words, trust in government is undermined to a greater extent by the belief that the government is not looking after citizen interests than it is that the government is incompetent or lacking integrity. We link these to determinants in existing literature and suggest mechanisms to (re)build trust given these findings.

We do so through conjoint experiments in five countries, which indicates broad agreement that benevolence, followed equally by integrity and competence, are the primary determinants of trust judgements. In other words, trust in government is undermined to a greater extent by the belief that the government is not looking after citizen interests than it is that the government is incompetent or lacking integrity. We link these to determinants in existing literature and suggest mechanisms to (re)build trust given these findings.

The paper utilises utility theory to explain how deindustrialization affects the public's trust in democratic institutions. According to Utility Theory, those with lower incomes and education levels will not profit from deindustrialization, whereas those with higher incomes and education levels will. Using data from the European Value Studies and the World Value Studies, a Bayesian Multilevel Analysis is performed to determine the impact of deindustrialization on trust in democratic institutions among various income and educational groups. According to the findings, deindustrialization is associated with an increase in the polarisation of public trust in democratic institutions between higher- and lower-income groups. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect, case studies are proposed to establish different pathways through which deindustrialization can lead to an increase in political mistrust.

The great majority of recent studies on political inequality identify the ‘working class’ as the social group that governments are least responsive to and is lacking descriptive representation. These studies treat the ‘working class’ as one homogeneous group, although empirically it shows that this group became more heterogeneous over time (increasing shares of pink-collar workers and immigrants). When looking at the political attitudes and electoral behaviour of this group, empirical findings are contradicting. To shed light on this, Evans et al. (2022) look at Denmark and the United Kingdom to show that the empirical contradictions can be explained by national differences in class identity. This is reflected in distinct political attitudes on redistributive and immigration policies. Thus, one might wonder whether these differences may also be observed in political trust? To analyse this question, I draw on ISSP data comparing attitudes of British and Scandinavian respondents. I expect workers drawing on their current class positions to be more trusting in core political institutions than workers referring to their class origin.

How does it affect perceptions of what is acceptable in the political realm? We argue that spatial connectivity can change political norms by exposing individuals to reference groups that are different from those in the area of their primary residence. These new reference groups may have different views as to what is acceptable in politics, thus leading to the spread of different political norms. To test this hypothesis, we leverage data on mobility across Spanish regions. We focus on norms against public support for the radical right, one of the most well-established norms in the political realm. Taking advantage of two close elections (April and November 2019), we will test whether mobility in the summer between those elections led to more similar perceptions of the how appropriate it is to express support for the radical right. Our results will highlight how short-term mobility can lead to the spread of ideas in politics and significantly affect norms that regulate the political realm.

In this paper, we contribute to this literature and assess how local boundary reforms affect citizens' attitudes. We combine data on Swiss municipal mergers with individual-level panel data from the Swiss Household Panel to study how jurisdictional reforms impact citizens' political trust, satisfaction with democracy, political interest, and perceptions of political influence. This data allows to compare individuals living in merged municipalities with individuals living in non-merged municipalities and to assess the effects of local boundary reforms over a long time-period (1999-2019). While we find no effect of municipal mergers on citizens' political trust, satisfaction with democracy, and political interest, using a difference-in-differences design, we uncover a positive effect on individuals' perceptions of political influence -- a finding that goes decidedly against the established literature. We argue that this positive effect has to do with the specific participatory nature of municipal mergers in Switzerland.

Does political polarization harm citizens' subjective sense of free speech? Seminal accounts in political science such as the ‘spiral of silence’, conformity pressures in social networks, or online echo-chambers point to social in-group mechanisms that can restrict citizens' free expression. We offer a novel alternative argument that focuses on a different aspect of political polarization. We decompose polarization into two parts: in-group attachment and out-group aversion. Specifically, we argue that out-group aversion reduces normative constraints on citizens' expression and therefore has a liberating effect on subjective free speech. We test our argument using data from two original surveys fielded in Germany and including a new measure of out-group aversion. The results broadly support our argument and suggest that out-group aversion not only significantly increases subjective freedom of speech, but is of far greater relevance than contrasting in-group mechanisms. This finding has important implications for our understanding of political polarization, public opinion and democratic culture.

However, political discussions online are polarised, plagued by hostility, ‘fake news’, trolls, and more. While much work has been done to understand the political consequences of this, the secondary social effects of having such a climate around online political discussions remain understudied. In this study, I address this by examining the link between exposure to polarised political discourse and generalised trust. I use a vignette survey experiment where I show respondents a series of tweets - the overall distribution of which varies in the degree of polarisation between treatment groups - in a 2x2 factorial design: non-polarised/neutral, pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal, and polarised (a mix of pro- and counter-attitudinal tweets). This is designed to manipulate respondents' levels of perceived polarisation through exposure to polarised discussions on social media. I then measure respondents' levels of generalised trust using survey-based measures, asking respondents directly about their attitudes, as well as using behavioural measures.

While there is thus strong evidence of growing numbers of economically-right, culturally-libertarian (‘right-libertarian’) voters, I show that these voters do not support liberal parties that best share their positioning, instead favouring more distant alternatives. Using cross-national data supplemented with an analysis of the 2017 German federal election, I test the theory that right-libertarians’ stable socioeconomic circumstances lead to greater political satisfaction, disincentivizing them from ‘rocking the boat’ by switching parties. In line with theoretical expectations, regression analyses from the cross-national level find right-libertarians to display consistently high levels of political satisfaction. At the German level, right-libertarians were also least likely to switch parties between 2013 and 2017, causing the liberal FDP to miss out on large numbers of like-minded voters. These findings suggest that satisfaction can act as a check on the behaviour of voters who may otherwise be expected to follow a logic of proximity voting in switching parties as the two-dimensional space has developed.

Cohort differences in Consideration Set Models	This paper studies an """"""""overlooked stage"""""""" of electoral realignment with a generational perspective: the consideration stage of voting. Related to this, it focuses both on the size of different cohorts’ consideration sets as well as their composition over time. I expect more recent cohorts, socialized in a fragmented party space and less bound to structural determinants of voting, to be more likely to include more parties in their consideration set than less recent cohorts.Furthermore, they have different reasoning for which parties to include in their consideration set: Parties’ positions on the socioeconomic dimension matter less than spatial closeness on the sociocultural dimension. Thus, increasing volatility among more recent cohorts might be an effect of those cohorts’ increased consideration set size when compared with older voters, while electoral shifts might be a result of divergent preferences on which parties land up in a consideration set. I test these assumptions using cross-sectional longitudinal election data from the EES (1999-2019) covering eight Western European countries. I apply APC models (including Age, Period, and Cohort) to disentangle different dimensions of age.

We combine data from the IMGES I survey and the GLES post-election survey 2017 and are thus able to compare natives and immigrant-origin voters. Preliminary evidence shows that immigrant-origin citizens are indeed more conservative than natives when it comes to value orientations towards tradition and a preference for the traditional family but not with regard to immigration, which affects voting possibilities as no party caters to this preference combination.

Combining candidates and voter surveys from 49 elections, we estimate candidate-voters congruence based on demographic (gender, race, age, etc.) and political characteristics (partisanship, political participation, etc.).

The impact of public holiday legislation on ethnoreligious minorities' survival strategies.	How do minorities react to exclusionary nation-building policies? While some scholars see minorities' oppression as a necessary part of national homogenization, others emphasize their negative consequences. The paper contributes to this debate by focusing on the enaction of a state policy aimed at a specific ethnoreligious community, the Sephardi Jews of Salonica (Greece). Most importantly, it does so by studying the targeted group in conjunction with the choices made by members of the majority society. The paper provides causal evidence on the effect of institutional discrimination on minorities' economic status, using the 1924 Sunday closing law as a treatment. The 1924 law changed the holiday from Saturday to Sunday to signal that Christianity is the state's official religion. This effectively made opening Jewish businesses on Sundays impossible. Given that Saturday was a day of rest for Jews, Jewish store owners were forced to close their stores for two days during the week. To investigate the impact of this policy, I use a single measure: business records, implementing a business survival analysis.

The dominant explanation of this puzzle points to the pervasive discrimination and exclusion Muslims face in Western Europe.

The paper builds on social identity theory to argue that the effect of PD on identification as Muslim weakens with increasing SES due to their different coping strategies against discrimination.

It is not clear what makes individuals embrace these unrestricted (liberal) or restrained (protective) models of freedom of expression. Moreover, existing research focuses on the views of the general public, but not minorities, who are often the target of derogatory speech. In this study, we investigate the impact of hate speech on European Muslims' attitudes towards freedom of expression. For this purpose, we exploit an unexpected event occurred during the fieldwork of the European Social Survey: the release of the “Innocence of Muslims”, a short film that denigrates Islamic prophet Muhammad. The findings indicate that Muslims who were exposed to hate speech adopted a more protective stance towards freedom of expression. These findings have relevant implications for current debates on the limits of free speech and for understanding minorities' views about democracy.

A diverse range of radical parties and candidates have successfully mobilised public disillusionment with politicians’ alleged responsibility for economic inequality and decline. While much of the academic literature around this topic focuses on the predictive power of macro-level economic trends on radical vote choice, much less research centres individuals' attitudes towards economic inequality itself. Addressing this gap, this paper applies the novel framework of 'subjective economic inequality' to centre individual beliefs, perceptions and fairness judgements. This paper presents evidence of how subjective economic inequality can explain between-unit and within-unit differences for an established indicator of disillusionment: political trust. Using cross-sectional and panel data from multiple waves of the British Election Study Internet Panel, this study contributes to the ongoing debate around economic inequality and its consequence for political opinion and behaviour.

Dimensions of Economic Inequalities and Fairness Perceptions in the US	Previous research has reached conflicting conclusions on how individuals evaluate information on inequalities, and how that affects their fairness perception and the need for redistribution. Empirical evidence suggests that attitudes towards inequalities and policy preferences are influenced by inequalities only when they are perceived as unfair. In this paper, I put this argument to the test, measuring how different types of information on economic inequalities influence fairness perceptions. While previous literature has conceptualized economic inequalities as a unidimensional phenomenon, I suggest that inequalities are a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Building on existing measures of inequalities, I test whether information regarding the different dimensions of inequalities influences fairness perceptions, and how each of these dimensions contributes to the overall perceived unfairness of existing inequalities. I identify the main dimensions explored in previous research—replicating some of the information treatment and adding new ones—and field a well-powered, and pre-registered conjoint experiment. The set of information provided is based on real-life distributions of different dimensions of inequalities across US states, to provide realistic inequalities profiles.

A promising avenue of research has been to test whether the visibility of inequality matters in shifting perceptions (Sands 2017; 2020). Employing panel data from the UK related to redistributive preferences and proximity to deprivation, we find a significant and positive effect: openings of new food banks in an area are significantly linked to an increase in redistributive preferences. We argue that the impact of food banks derives from the visibility of the primary need they serve, acting as a reminder people go hungry in this economic system and countering negative stereotypes people may receive about welfare claimants. To test the mechanism, we employ a novel dataset of Twitter panel data. To explore whether the effect works through a mechanism of updated information on welfare claimants (reducing stereotypes) or rather by enhanced pro-sociality in the community, we analyse Tweets related to redistribution connected to the local authority level via pre-trained machine learning algorithms and topic modelling.

In particular, after November 2020, the American public showed substantial increases in partisan polarization over beliefs in the integrity and trustworthiness of the election outcomes. What is less well understood is how these same partisan patterns were evident among a group of governmental actors who presumably should be better informed about election practices and more resistant to mis- and disinformation about the 2020 election: local election administrators. In this research, we explore gaps in views of election integrity between local election administrators and the mass public. We compare these viewpoints at two time periods: the summer before the 2020 presidential election (before the emergence of the """"""""big lie"""""""" and the summer before the 2022 midterm election (after eighteen months of the """"""""big lie""""""""). This research has important implications for our understanding of representative democracy, election management, and how elites can be prone to some of the same conspiracy thinking that impacts the mass public.

Does this elite polarization cause mass ideological polarization? I argue that when a political party takes a more extreme position, masses polarize through two mechanisms. In-partisans should follow the party and adopt a more extreme ideological stance while out-partisans should backlash and move in the opposite direction. Furthermore, I argue that whether in-partisans become polarized depends on their spatial location on the ideological scale. If a party moves to left, only those who are to the right of the party should adopt more left-wing stance. To test these expectations, I exploit a real-world sudden party polarization when the Labour Party shifted to the left. Using British Election Study Internet Panel data, I find limited evidence that elite polarization leads to mass polarization: Overall, neither in-partisans nor out-partisans became more polarized. Only Labour partisans that were located to the right of the party became more left-wing. These findings provide insight into how masses react to increasing elite polarization, alleviating pundits' concern that masses are deemed to polarize if political parties polarize.

In this paper, I implement a novel survey experiment in Sweden and Norway which exposes voters to a campaign ad that links Swedish and Norwegian political parties to their electorally successful and governing counterparts in Germany. By manipulating the content of this ad to invoke the name of the sister party abroad or the broader ideology of the shared transnational party family, I gain useful empirical leverage to isolate the effect of transnational allegiances on a party’s brand. I argue that a party connecting itself to an electorally successful party abroad should have positive consequences for its perceived viability, credibility, and competency in the eyes of voters. These effects should be especially pronounced for small parties at the party level and for partisans at the voter level. This experiment has important implications for our understandings of transnational party politics and the transnational linkages between voters and parties.

While in the meantime more radical parties like the Greens or the AFD have recorded increasing support. Using CHES and ESS data and considering 2006-2020 period, polarization is first measured through an index taking in account both parties’ position on issues and their respective electoral weight. Mass polarization is studied through population’s positions on issues. Finally, models establish the impact of social and positional characteristics on the individual probability to vote for a party over time. The results indicate that population hasn't been polarizing over time, but the polarization of parties has been increasing since 2014 and AFD appearance. Variables traditionally associated with voting for the mainstreams have been fading over time, and their interaction with ESS waves since 2014 supports the hypothesis of a running voter sorting undermining mainstream parties’ successes without polarizing the whole electorate.

Evidence from German Elections	Empirical research on the electoral fallout of party ambiguity and voter uncertainty has often been ambiguous and uncertain itself. The focuses on an German election survey that does not only inquire voters about party locations but also about the uncertainty associated with these placements. Our contribution proceeds in two consecutive steps: (1) We show that, within the expected utility framework, voter reactions to ambiguity and uncertainty are moderated by attitudes towards risk. We demonstrate that large parts of modern electorates are rather risk-neutral than risk-averse so that the usual assumption of strictly concave utility profiles cannot be sustained. (2) Building upon these findings, we hypothesize that the political consequences of party ambiguity and voter uncertainty are dependent on voter attitudes towards risk: (2a) We demonstrate that party ambiguity and voter uncertainty are likely to reduce the electoral fortunes of political parties. (2b) Relatedly, we show that voter uncertainty tends to reduce the salience of spatial vis-à-vis non-spatial components of voter utility. (2c) These effects provide party strategists with additional strategic options by laying out blurred campaign messages and/ or platforms.

How voters trace the coalition program to parties	Previous research on party promises has focused on understanding the making and fulfilment of political promises and the translation of electoral promises into coalition promises. It has also started to analyse whether and under which conditions voters accurately perceive pledge fulfilment. However, we still lack knowledge as to whether citizens are able to assign pledges to parties, more specifically whether they accurately trace coalition programs to electoral programs. Based on data from a representative face-to-face survey conducted in Germany in 2019 (N = 1.200), this paper examines whether citizens are able to identify which party a coalition promise comes from (based on a sample of 17 coalition pledges). It tests how different factors, such as party ID and pledge saliency, affects citizens’ (in)accurate perceptions. The findings of this paper have implications on accountability and political representation in multi-party systems.

Public opinion disagreement, issue alignment, and sorting across European countries	Whereas attitudinal polarization has become a hot topic for academic debates in the USA over recent decades, the question of whether, and over which issues, European countries are polarized has so far received limited scholarly attention. Existing studies focus on single countries and different types of attitudinal polarization, not allowing for cross-national comparisons. This article provides such a comparison of the state of attitudinal polarization across 21 EU member states. Using the EVS-2017 data, we study three types of attitudinal polarization (disagreement, issue alignment, and sorting) over five key attitudinal dimensions: social inequality, immigration, EU-integration, gender, and environment. We demonstrate that different types of attitudinal polarization do not coincide with each other on a country level but do produce geographical clusters. Polarization as disagreement is higher in the East and South of Europe, while issue alignment and sorting are higher in the North and West. Looking at the three types of polarization together, immigration is the most polarizing dimension across Europe, though polarization as disagreement and sorting is also still substantial with respect to social inequality.

Within this framework, the ‘room to manoeuvre’ theory argues that greater integration eventually decreases turnout by limiting the choices available to voters, thereby weakening the stake of elections. However, this finding is still debated empirically. Indeed, Blais and Kostelka (2021), recently found that the deepening of globalization is not associated with the decrease of turnout in the long run. This discrepancy thus calls for more research. In fact, there exists almost no studies which have theorized, and tested, the causal mechanism underlying the relationship between globalization constraints and turnout at the individual level, while no study has ever tested this relationship experimentally. This study fill this gap by investigating the effects of perceived constraints on turnout and by highlighting the role individual meanings of voting play in the process. We put these propositions to the test using an original experiment fielded in the 2022 midterm elections in the US. Findings have implications for theories linking government constraints and democratic legitimacy.

Can unconditional cash transfers weaken the link between income and turnout? We study a unique experiment in Finland, which randomly assigned a sizable group of unemployed to basic income for two years (2017-19). Leveraging individual-level registry and survey data, we show that replacing conditional unemployment benefits with unconditional basic income has large positive effects on actual voter turnout and subjective levels of political efficacy. On average, the intervention increases turnout in municipal elections by about 3 p.p., an effect that is magnified among marginal voters (+ 6-8 p.p.) and persists in national elections after the end of the experiment. Our analysis suggests that the turnout effects are driven by unconditionality increasing social capital -- rather than income itself. We discuss implications for theories of voter turnout and policy feedback, and the design of basic income policies.

Despite the methodological challenges for robustly analyzing broad repertoires of participation across multiple contexts, these questions have become increasingly urgent due to mounting concerns about inequality in political participation and representation worldwide. We answer these questions in the current study by implementing recently developed techniques for latent class analysis using cross-national data from the European Social Survey (ESS) between 2002-2018. Specifically, we implement methodological innovations for conducting latent class analysis in complex multilevel data structures with covariates and measurement equivalence testing using a stepwise approach. The findings provide a well-specified assessment of three substantive areas of interest in relation to central debates in the political participation literature: socio-economic stratification across participant types, cross-national assessment, and over-time change. At a time of increased concern for unequal representation in contemporary democracies, we conclude by discussing both the methodological and substantive implications of our findings.

Most post-industrial democracies are characterized by high spatial inequality with an increasingly unequal distribution of economic opportunity between prosperous and lagging-behind areas.

We ask about the societal implications of this policy recommendation by examining its theoretically ambiguous effects on political integration. While the expected improvements in economic outcomes could stimulate political participation, a change in location also creates disruption that may work in the other direction. We study the case of Germany. In a first step, we descriptively map spatial inequality by combining various innovative data sources into a rich indicator of local economic opportunity at the NUTS-3 level. We then merge this opportunity map with micro-level panel data to explore individual moving patterns and the important question of selection into opportunity moves. Finally, we look at economic and political outcomes of distinct types of relocation with a particular focus on differential political participation. Our results imply that there may be no trade-off between the economic goals of “moving people to jobs” and its broader societal consequences.

I argue that firms that primarily rely on higher education graduates with specific skills (e.g. STEM graduates) will skill update their graduates relatively more than firms that primarily rely on graduates with general high skill sets (e.g. social science graduates). I further posit that firms with a theoretical skill orientation skill update more through formal educational institutions while firms with a practical skill orientation rely more on in-house skill updating. I test the arguments leveraging comparative employer and individual survey data covering the universe of European countries. Using firm-level and individual-level data survey data, I find empirical support for the propositions. The paper identifies a new link between the nature of skills and skill updating, shows how skill orientation is linked to the type of skill updating, and stresses the importance of continual skill improvement in the knowledge economy.

In this context, a growing literature argues that automation risk should increase individual demand for generous social policy. Yet, empirical findings are mixed. In this paper, we argue that the existing literature overlooks the moderating role of skill formation systems. In particular, we posit that dual VET systems undermine the link between automation risk and social policy preferences. Because they authoritatively certify the skills acquired, dual VET systems reduce the perceived risk associated with working in a routine-intensive occupation. Additionally, by allowing individuals to command above-average salaries early in their career, and by socialising young people mostly at the workplace, they instill """"""""workfarist"""""""" attitudes in individuals who went through the dual system. These mechanisms combine to sever the relationship between automation risk and demand for social policy in countries with a high dual VET share. Based on data from the ESS and OECD, we find evidence for this argument. Our paper therefore contributes a missing link to the literature on technological change and social policy preferences.

Housing policy in most developed countries strongly favours homeowners and landlords. Homeowners have higher political efficacy and turnout, which further incentivises politicians to direct policy towards them -- a self-reinforcing equilibrium. We present a novel theory of housing preferences that recognizes risk in the housing market, and could suggest a way out of this equilibrium for policymakers. We argue that individuals form housing preferences based on house price and insecurity considerations, and that experiencing housing insecurity is associated with lower political efficacy and participation. Using long-run survey data from the UK we show that insecurity affects political efficacy most for renters but it also makes insecure home owners behave similarly to renters. Using a survey experiment, we show that candidates who put forward housing policies that target both prices and insecurity successfully engage previously marginalized groups in the housing market.

Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design.	How does holding governments to account affect the political behaviour and attitudes of voters? Electoral accountability is a foundational element of representative democracies. Yet, recent scholarly work has questioned the relevance of electoral accountability because voters often struggle to adequately punish governments for their performance, and because political parties in government may have little control over performance metrics. These findings call the relevance of electoral accountability into question. This paper advances the contemporary debate by analyzing the behavioural and attitudinal benefits of electoral accountability, even if citizens fail to adequately punish governments. I argue that when voters hold governments to account at the ballot box this has beneficial downstream effects on voters' political behaviour and political attitudes. In order to provide a causal estimation of the effect of electoral accountability on voters' subsequent behaviour and attitudes I make use of a regression discontinuity design that leverages exogenous variation in the eligibility to vote.

First, we use survey data collected around an unrelated event that increased the salience of GBV. Comparing respondents interviewed before and after the event, we find that government popularity suffers when GBV gains salience. Next, we conduct a survey experiment. We show participants a hypothetical news article about a woman murdered by her partner. We randomize the rhetorical tactics the government uses to shift the blame to other actors. As outcomes, we ask whether participants blame the government for this event or GBV more generally, whether participants express less support for the government, and whether participants are willing to take action to support anti-GBV groups in Turkey. This analysis advances our knowledge about how attributions of responsibility function for entrenched social problems, and who is more likely to hold the government responsible and why.

The role of political parties in the recruitment of ministers is changing, with technocrats, outsiders and elites with little party involvement entering ministerial positions. As accountability, and thus representative democracy, functions by and through political parties, this phenomenon dissociates government performance from the options on the ballot. As a result, this may shift responsibility away from political parties, leading to an accountability deficit. This paper investigates for the first time how voters assign responsibility for the actions of ministers with stronger and weaker partisan ties. While weak partisan ties may make it more difficult to identify who is responsible for government outcomes, I also investigate whether it moderates partisan motivated reasoning when assigning responsibility. I answer these questions by conducting a single-profile conjoint experiment in Italy.

Selective information exposure and the electoral punishment of corruption	Citizens are expected to punish corrupt politicians at the polls. Lab and survey experiments consistently show that citizens are unlikely to vote for candidates that engage in corruption. However, observational studies and field experiments frequently conclude that corrupt politicians are only mildly punished by voters. This contradiction might be caused by some of these designs not accounting for information self-selection. To overcome this limitation this paper implements a Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) experimental design that allows us to analyze the impact of corruption on voting behavior accounting for information preferences and self-selection. The results indicate that when given the option the majority of citizens do not expose themselves to information about corruption involving their preferred party and, at the same time, electoral punishment of corruption is dependent on individuals’ information preferences. The potential effects of being exposed to this information are particularly large among individuals who prefer to avoid political information altogether and consume entertainment instead. This suggests that the exposure of inattentive citizens to information about corruption scandals would increase accountability.

Many scholars believe that economic conditions matter only marginally. They claim that cultural determinants trump economic conditions. My paper shows another reason why economic shocks do not matter as much as expected. This is because companies “absorb” the impact of these shocks and politics remains quite insulated from them. Two empirical tests support this argument. First, I examine how sociotropic economic shocks (e.g., the opening of a factory or offshoring) affect voting behavior. I employ a new dataset that matches 25,000 restructuring events with subnational election results for 27 EU countries for the past 20 years and I find that these shocks do not affect incumbent and populist support. Second, I use vignette experiments embedded in nationally representative surveys in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy, and Romania) to demonstrate that voters attribute responsibility for these events to a non-political actor (the firm), as opposed to a political entity (the national government). These results hold for both negative and positive shocks.

This is key to understanding the incentives for leaders to engage in bordering practices at a time when fears relating to a globalized world have become a highly salient and contested issue in domestic politics. We argue that people induced to feel anxious display a higher support for closed borders, and for stricter border security measures, especially if the neighboring country is perceived to be more dissimilar from their own and the policy is justified with an external threat. We test our expectations with a survey of 4000 German citizens. Respondents receive sequentially a priming experiment that induces feeling of anxiety, and a conjoint experiment that presents them with pairs of border policy plans, which include information on the policy justification, intended policy measure, and type of neighboring country.

We argue that people induced to feel anxious display a higher support for closed borders, and for stricter border security measures, especially if the neighboring country is perceived to be more dissimilar from their own and the policy is justified with an external threat. We test our expectations with a survey of 4000 German citizens. Respondents receive sequentially a priming experiment that induces feeling of anxiety, and a conjoint experiment that presents them with pairs of border policy plans, which include information on the policy justification, intended policy measure, and type of neighboring country.

Where do pro-immigration attitudes come from? This study focuses on the role of two fundamental interpersonal orientations - generalised social trust and prosociality, both of which are often deemed as desirable, but often have ingroup bias tendencies. Then do they have any meaningful implications on immigration attitudes? To answer these questions, the study uses a large Swedish twin sample to examine the effects of generalised social trust and multiple prosocial behaviours on immigration policy views. The use of twin-pair fixed effects models help to effectively control for confoundings shared within twin pairs. The results suggest that individuals with higher generalised trust as well as volunteers, charity donors, and registered organ donors are more likely to express approval for pro-immigration policies. However, using a subsample of identical twins, only the positive effects of trust remain robust. Generalised trust, therefore, appears to be a robust determinant for pro-immigration attitudes, which also indicates an inclusionary outlook of social trust in Sweden.

I study the mass displacement of Venezuelan nationals, and through a difference-in-differences research design, I compare the effectiveness of introducing visa restrictions in reducing overall migration flows in certain countries across South America. I use a data set of 85,000 migrants and refugees - mostly Venezuelans - surveyed by the UNHCR as part of its monitoring activity of displaced migrants in the Latin American region. Findings suggest that visa restrictions increased irregular entry and irregular visa status for migrants while also leading to changes in their priorities. Unexpectedly, I do not find evidence of increased violence suffered by migrants who switch towards irregular entry channels. This research contributes to the academic and policy debate on the effectiveness of visa restrictions on migratory flows, as well the literature on the effects of migration policies on migrants' well-being.

How does it shape vote choice? I argue that relative to cultural and economic immigration threat, differences between left-wing and right-wing voters are small on the dimension of crime. High concern about immigrant crime among left-wing voters -- even those with high educational attainment and those living in cities -- coupled with left-wing parties' lack of law-and-order positions creates a voter-party mismatch that can lead to electoral shifts benefiting right-wing parties. Using survey data from 14 Western European countries linked with data on party positions, I first empirically confirm the voter-party mismatch on the Left, especially among Green and radical-left parties. Drawing on a panel survey from Germany, I further show that concern about immigration and crime increases vote intention for the center-right among Green party voters. Exploring mechanisms, I present evidence consistent with the idea of a voter-party mismatch. I conclude that a more complete understanding of how immigration shapes electoral politics must incorporate crime as an important dimension.

Disagreement exists in the literature about whether political attitudes and behaviours are formed early in life and are resistant to change, or are highly adaptable in response to political experiences in a new context and as a migrant. We use data from the 2021 Canadian Election Survey with an over-representation of new Canadian residents, and which includes measures of self-assessed pre- and post-migration political ideology and party preferences. We show how new Canadian residents report a greater preference for Canadian political parties on the left of the parties they preferred pre-migration. This finding is in line with the literature on immigrants’ vote choice that shows a preference of parties on the left of the political spectrum among immigrants, but sharply contrasts with our second finding: new Canadian residents simultaneously report a shift to the ideological right post-migration. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature.

To what extent is support for social policies conditional? Our thesis is that irrespective of the direction of the policy, support is conditional on several aspects of social identity: identity, affiliation, support of the ethnic ingroup, rejection of the ethnic outgroup, and the nativist rationale of the social policy. Using a visual conjoint experiment in the Netherlands, we confirm our expectations. Although the effects have a greater impact among nativists on all other facets of social identity, support or rejection of the ethnic ingroup can drastically alter policy support also among non-nativist citizens. These results have key implications on the variable nature of citizens' support for the backsliding of liberal democratic tenets.

In this study, we add to the scant existing research by investigating the effectiveness of different arguments/forms of evidence for changing natives’ concerns about discrimination of ethnic minorities.

In two survey experiments, we find that both types of evidence cause native Danes to become somewhat more concerned about discrimination, but the personal story is significantly more effective. The personal story also increases donations to a charity for ethnic minority members (a behavioral indicator of out-group relations), and elevate support for anti-discriminatory policies. We also find evidence that the positive effective of the personal story is driven by positive affect. Our results suggest cautious optimism for raising awareness about discrimination.

However, the emotional roots of affective polarization are not very well known beyond anger and anxiety. In this article, I study how the “self-conscious” emotions shame and pride affect affective polarization. In two survey experiments in Great Britain and the United States, I elicit shame and pride in respondents using “emotion recall” and measure the effects of these emotions on affective polarization.

Compared to the classic but rare two party case in the US, there are more points of reference between which ideological differences and affect can occur. Recent approaches considered groups of favoured and unfavoured parties, but continue to treat all parties individually. I argue that the perception of political camps consisting of multiple ideologically close parties plays a crucial role in the judgement of politically opposite politicians and voters. Following literature from psychology on out group perception, I assume that opposing parties are perceived as ideologically more homogenous than those on one's own side of the political spectrum. Using attitudinal and ideological perception items on each party from a multiwave panel survey surrounding the German federal election 2021, I analyse the perception of homeogenous party camps depending on party affiliation and ideological self placement. I furthermore test hypotheses regarding affect. I conclude that for valid measurements of polarization in multi-party systems, one should focus on differences between party camps rather than just individual parties.

To address this gap, we test the generalizability of partisan bias spillover into non-political decisions in the European and US context. Specifically, we use a conjoint analysis to evaluate the impact of political and non-political factors on three types of social decisions: selecting a spouse, choosing a neighborhood to live in, and deciding which business to patronize. Consistent with prior findings, we expect that partisanship will strongly influence all three social decisions, even when non-political but still politically relevant information is controlled. Additionally, we assess the strength of partisan discrimination against utility-maximizing factors relevant to each social decision to define the limits of partisan bias and affective polarization in comparative perspective.

We investigate this question by examining data on respondent assumptions about the ideological proximity of hypothetical voters via an original survey experiment fielded in Canada, Germany, and the UK. In doing so, we build on the Social Categorization Model as well as recent political science research on second order political beliefs. Our study begins by laying out patterns in perceived left-right placement based on partisan affiliations, highlighting that placements are less extreme than one might expect based on broader survey evidence. The main analysis then explores the potential role of shared partisanship and overlapping demographic markers in increasing the presumed ideological (dis-)similarity of others. Results suggest that across all three of our country cases, projection plays an important role in shaping how we think about the political stances of others – but that the effects of demographic markers are only substantively significant vis-à-vis people who lack an explicit partisan affiliation.

The scarcity of research addressing this question, as well as the shadow of self-selection looming over most of it, calls for more research on the relationship between inter-class contact and political attitudes. I contribute to this field by examining an unexplored institution in the existing literature: compulsory military service. A diff-in-diff approach, focusing on Spanish cohorts close to the removal of conscription and with females as the control group, reveals that males born in conscripted cohorts are significantly more likely to support redistribution. I present placebo tests discarding that these findings merely reflect a differing trend between genders in a broader set of political attitudes, as well as several robustness checks. Furthermore, I rule out plausible alternative explanations as well as present empirical evidence in support of conscription increasing inter-class contact.

But it is also possible that a great deal of political disagreement arises from politics itself, as citizens observing political contestation come to believe different things about which problems are societally important and which can be addressed through government action. We report results from a novel survey experimental design that presents respondents with pairwise comparisons of the relative severity of social problems in each single instance of the problem, pairwise comparisons of the relative severity of the problem in the aggregate across society, and pairwise comparisons of the priority for government addressing these same social problems. We use responses from these data—combined with auxiliary questions about perceived prevalence of the same set of problems and perceived feasibility of government action—to locate where ideological and partisan differences arise, whether in the evaluation of the problems themselves, in perceptions of aggregate severity, or in the plausibility that government can address them.

We use responses from these data—combined with auxiliary questions about perceived prevalence of the same set of problems and perceived feasibility of government action—to locate where ideological and partisan differences arise, whether in the evaluation of the problems themselves, in perceptions of aggregate severity, or in the plausibility that government can address them.

Lindemann	Hertie School, Berlin, Germany	p	y	939	BO049	Redistribution Preferences in an Experimental Online Game	How do highly redistributive regimes affect redistribution preferences? Evidence from literature on political socialisation and authoritarian legacies shows that in new democracies, a bias is present against the ideological spectrum connected to the former authoritarian ideology. Experiences that can be clearly tied to a particular political ideology can, therefore, create negative associations with such. This pattern can also be observed for immigrants coming from (former) communist countries. In this experiment programmed in oTree, I take a step back to assess the effect of highly redistributive regimes on support for redistribution preferences using attitudinal and behavioural measures. Results suggest heterogeneous treatment effects for age and prior political stances. The observed effects also depend on the specific redistribution outcome examined. Unlike expected, highly redistributive systems tend to increase redistribution preferences. This effect is stronger for those actually benefitting from this system. By conducting this experimental online game, I do not only contribute to the understanding of institutions and redistribution preferences, but also propose a combined attitudinal and behavioural approach to experimentally measure preferences.

However, our research suggests that these effects may be more complex than previously thought. We argue that citizens who live in contexts of good governance may adapt their expectations and respond with heightened discontent if these expectations are not met. To test this assertion, we conducted a study in German cities using a geo-coded survey experiment to investigate the relationship between violence and citizens' perceptions of social relations. We find that encountering violence leads to a more pessimistic view of social relations in the neighborhood and society as a whole. Importantly, we find that respondents who assessed the local government as being efficient and responsive were more likely to """"""""hunker down"""""""" in response to violence, suggesting that good governance can raise citizens' expectations and magnify the negative effects of deviations from these expectations. These findings challenge assumptions about the straightforward benefits of good governance and highlight the need for further research on the dynamic relationship between governance and citizens' political attitudes.

Yet, we still lack information on the influence of religiosity on the success of right-wing parties. This is surprising given anecdotal evidence suggests this success to be often based on the support of Christian-fundamentalist groups of citizens. To explore the effect of religiosity, I examine the impact of a multidimensional concept of religiosity – including the dimensions of belonging, beliefs, and behaviour – on nativist attitudes that have been shown to be the key predictor of right-wing voting. To do so, I use data from the ninth wave of the European Social Survey, covering 47,811 respondents in 29 European countries. Implementing multilevel analysis, I find a positive effect of belonging on nativism and a negative effect of beliefs on nativism in Europe. As I outline in more detail in the conclusion, these findings underline the relevance of a more differentiated approach towards religiosity.

The theory of anomie, developed by Émile Durkheim and Robert K. Merton, suggests that social disintegration and the loss of normative meaning can lead to declines in the social order. However, this potential factor in the destabilization of democracy has largely been studied theoretically. This study aims to investigate the relationship between anomie and democracy-endangering attitudes and behaviors empirically, using original data from ten European countries. By examining levels of satisfaction with democracy, political trust, and the willingness to use violence to express political attitudes, the study seeks to understand how perceptions of an anomic state may foster anti-democratic attitudes. The research also looks at attitudes towards major crises, such as the Covid 19 pandemic, and their potential to contribute to social polarization and perceptions of division. By using original data from multiple countries, this study offers a unique and comprehensive look at the relationship between anomie and democracy in Europe.

Survey-based research has focused traditionally on one type of such belief – conventional religiosity, usually operationalised as belief in God. Comparative survey programmes, however, offer increasingly more nuanced measures of supernatural beliefs, including heterodox ones (that is, in astrology, faith healing, lucky charms and fortune telling). We argue that heterodoxy leads to patterns of political participation that distinguish it from conventional religious belief and non-belief. Using a comparative survey source, we demonstrate empirically that political science should treat heterodoxy as an important explanation of political behaviour. Applying an operationalisation that distinguishes heterodoxy from religious belief and non-belief, we find that heterodoxy is widespread in modern societies and is empirically associated with low electoral participation and extremist party choice. The role of heterodoxy in promoting these political outcomes highlights a previously overlooked cultural explanation of the current democratic malaise. The connection of heterodox beliefs with receptiveness to naïve epistemic claims defies immediate political solutions and supports ominous predictions regarding the future of good democratic governance.

The Use of Disruptive Protest to Change Public Discourse	Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil have made use of disruptive tactics designed to attract media attention to promote their cause. Critics accuse them of setting back the climate movement by generating negative sentiments about environmental activism. However, the activists involved in disruptive actions themselves do not see this as a problem: they acknowledge that what they are doing is unpopular, but argue that this is outweighed by the benefits of greater attention for their issue in public discourse. Can disruptive protests succeed in increasing support for their policy ideas in public discourse despite their controversial tactics? This study seeks to answer this question by measuring changes in the favourability of public discourse from protest groups’ own perspectives. I analyse news discourse about three policy areas in the UK - climate change, immigration, and austerity - and quantitatively measure its similarity to the preferred discourse of different protest groups over a 10 year period. The results should provide insight into the tactical trade-offs activists face, with implications for theorists of contentious politics as well as practical implications for activists themselves.

While the role of ideology and political narratives in the inequality-redistribution link has been extensively investigated, there is no empirical evidence connecting political mobilization with redistributive demands. Against classic rational choice models, experimental and observational evidence shows that ideology, perceptions, or morals affect people's redistributive demands. However, we still know little about whether this experimental evidence might translate to actual political settings. The present paper argues that massive mobilizations can affect people's preferences for redistribution by affecting their moral evaluations or perceptions of inequality. To test these expectations, I rely on a most-likely case approach with an 'unexpected event during survey design' methodology, studying the effect of several protests: anti-austerity waves in 2011 in Portugal and Spain and the French Gilets jaunes in 2018 and their spillover effects in Belgium and Switzerland. The results show that these protests led to higher redistributive demands, providing new insights into inequality and mobilization research. Moreover, the findings are informative about the role of protests in inducing or catalyzing party systems' change.

How action forms can benefit social movements’ public visibility and support	Social movements may strategically choose from a broad action repertoire and this choice can be consequential for their public visibility and support. Our study analyses under which conditions the choice of radical protest pays off or has diametral effects to movements’ public visibility. We draw on a comparison between two recent movements in Germany, i.e. Fridays for Future and the anti-Covid-containment Querdenken, since they both emerged as reaction to two pressing current social challenges, i.e. climate change and the Covid-pandemic. Comparing these two cases in the early phase of their protest activity, we are able to assess whether large protests or more radical action forms are more beneficial and how they are able to shape public discourse. We use automatically collected, fine-grained protest event data in combination with media-based measures of public resonance and support, which are based on state-of-the-art text-as-data approaches. Our findings contribute to research on social movements, communication science as well as public opinion studies.

Multinomial regression analyses show that recruits tend to be people from the center with low levels of organization and low levels of education. Political and social consequences are discussed.

Research shows that these cultural grievances also include gender and sexuality dimensions. How can we understand radical right voters’ cultural grievances in a comprehensive way, inclusive of immigration, gender and sexuality grievances? I analyse qualitative interviews with German radical right voters, asking how they perceive and argue about social group relations. I argue that interviewees disregard or justify existing discrimination structures. Further, they perceive zero-sum dynamics between advances for discriminated groups and losses for dominant groups. Together, these perceptions lead them to perceive advances for discriminated groups as unfairly harmful to dominant groups. The interviews illustrate these mechanisms for native-immigrant, men-women, and straight-LGBTQI+ group relations. However, interviewees consider group characteristics and therefore use different arguments to explain these perceptions for different groups. The study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of radical right voters’ cultural grievances, beyond immigration and inclusive of gender and sexuality dimensions.

What explains this mismatch between objective and perceived reality? We argue that this tension results from conflicting identity needs. Optimal Distinctiveness Theory proposes that individuals’ well-being relies on an optimal balance between their needs a.) to belong to the larger group and b.) to be recognized as unique entities within that larger group. We argue that most whites and men feel firm belonging to society and even perceive themselves as prototypical members of it. However, their firm belonging to the larger society, paired with a subjectively perceived erosion of subgroup recognition, leaves their need to be recognized as whites or men unsatisfied. Online experiments show that whites and men become more supportive of affirmative action and less hostile towards outgroups when their subgroups are recognized. Hence, minority empowerment will be more sustainable if majority members’ uniqueness need is accounted for.

The Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Technocratic Attitudes in Spain	Support for technocracy increases in times of crisis and economic shocks. However, we do not know how durable initial changes are and whether they can be translated into already existing ideological divides. The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis offers a suitable case study to answer these questions. We present results from a panel study in Spain conducted between January 2020 to November 2022. The results show that support for technocracy increased substantially just after the onset of the pandemic crisis. Moreover, we also show that an ideological divide has emerged in Spain around technocracy, as right-wing respondents (measured by vote choice before the outbreak) have become comparatively more technocratic. We explore two mechanisms explaining the ideological polarization in technocratic attitudes: (1) anti-incumbent reaction to the left-wing coalition government; and (2) activation of latent right-wing anti-democratic attitudes. The mechanisms are explored estimating the moderating effects of approval for the prime minister and proxies for latent authoritarian preferences (Francoist street names and electoral data). Overall, the results suggest that the initial increase in technocratic preferences was absorbed by the left-right cleavage.

A Study of Public Health Expertise during COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, and the US	How do citizens perceive different types of public health experts and what are the implications for compliance with public health measures? I study this question using a series of survey experiments implemented in Germany, Italy, and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experiments randomized whether respondents received a public health recommendation from either a generic, World Health Organization, national, or local public health expert. The results show little difference on overall acceptance of the recommendation, but they do indicate that different types of public health experts have strengths and weaknesses when communicating with the public. International and national experts were considered to be more competent and knowledgeable, while local health experts were trusted more to understand the needs of respondents’ communities. I also find some differences based on partisan affiliation, with right-wing respondents more affected by the treatments. These results suggest that distrust of experts may have different causes based on the nature of their position, which is important to consider when conveying public health measures to the public.

This paper focuses on theories explaining support for “technological protectionist” policies such as regulation and taxation. We theorize that support for such policies should be broadly based on whether they are perceived to be detrimental for economic growth and/or benefit particular groups who are losing out from rapid automation and workplace technological change. We also hypothesize that a set of measures that capture different forms of “technological risk” should correlate with support for such policies. To test our hypotheses, we present new data from large, representative samples in 5 EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden). We measure support for empowering unions to influence technological adoption in the workplace, regulating and taxing firms that substitute workers with machines or algorithms, regulating the “gig” economy and workplace monitoring, and taxing Internet retailers. We provide a battery of measures of various forms of risk and present the results of embedded experiments that frame the policy as having socio-tropic benefits but distributional costs.

Theory and Evidence	In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the use of algorithmic decision-making systems (ADSs) to assist or replace human decision-making in a wide range of policy contexts. These include decisions on issues such as policing, criminal sentencing, and social welfare assistance. How do citizens view the incorporation of this technology in making high-stakes decisions? I introduce a new theory to explain the conditions under which citizens view ADSs as legitimate, fair, and accurate and test it using two original experiments embedded in a national US survey. Using evidence on a wide range of decisions and policy domains, I show that citizens exhibit aversion to the use of ADSs in decisions that sanction rather than assist and when they are required to make inferences about individuals rather than collectives. Evidence from a second experiment suggests that the employment of ADSs in such contexts undermines the legitimacy of the policy decisions they inform. Overall, this study provides novel insights into ways that ADSs can be used in public policy and the political implications of this growing phenomenon.

A rapidly growing literature suggests that economic uncertainty created by structural transformation and technological change contributes to political dissatisfaction and the recent surge in populist voting. We address a natural but often overlooked follow-up question: can governments moderate political backlash to economic modernization through appropriate policy interventions? While existing work suggests that spending cuts and austerity are electorally harmful to governments, we know surprisingly little about the presence of the reverse mechanism. We theorize the conditions under which expansive government policies may increase political support among those affected by technological change and empirically zoom in on a carefully chosen and significant policy intervention: the French professional security contract (CSP), introduced with the explicit aim of supporting workers hit by structural economic change. Building on fine-grained register data from the French Public Employment Service, we examine whether the number of local CSP recipients mediates the relationship between structural economic change and municipal-level turnout and election outcomes. We complement the analysis with original surveys to study underlying mechanisms and test potential explanations of why a sizeable intervention does (not) moderate political responses.

On the one hand, the arrival of telecommunications, with the telegraph as a vanguard. On the other, Sweden and other countries witnessed the arrival of the labour movement. In this paper I investigate if places with greatest conflict, those municipalities with more strikes and work stoppages, had a greater adoption of technology. Autocratic or semi-democratic regimes typical of the 19th century could use newly arrived telecommunications to repress the labour movement, as the telegraph facilitated repression. Alternatively, monarchs and autocrats could invest less in disputed spots, and use new (and popular) technology to reward loyal areas. Using newly digitized panel data, I test which of the two hypotheses has greater empirical support.

As the recommendations or decisions made by the participants can be widely publicized, the positions advanced by ordinary citizens can provide the public with relevant cues on social norms around a given issue. This may have significant implications for voters' opinion formation, particularly if they share a social identity with the citizen representative. To test this argument, we present a visual conjoint experiment designed to closely mirror the actual online participation forum of the Conference for the Future of Europe, one of the largest citizens’ assemblies ever undertaken. By virtue of the conjoint, we experimentally manipulate the policy position, the extent to which the sender is conceived as an opinion leader, the polarization associated with the policy position put forward, and the sender’s shared local social identity.

The focus of existing studies is mainly on whether and how affective polarization in the electorate reflects policy or ideological differences between party supporters. This study looks at a different manifestation of affective polarization, namely how partisans see the meanings of voting of the outgroup party supporters. The focus is on how “dangerous” the ingroup would find the out-party winning the election to be. This is important because it might have consequences on how much sore a loser one will end up to be after the election. We study: a. How does affective polarization relate to perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting? b. Is there a link between perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting and satisfaction with/acceptance of the election results?

The focus of existing studies is mainly on whether and how affective polarization in the electorate reflects policy or ideological differences between party supporters. This study looks at a different manifestation of affective polarization, namely how partisans see the meanings of voting of the outgroup party supporters. The focus is on how “dangerous” the ingroup would find the out-party winning the election to be. This is important because it might have consequences on how much sore a loser one will end up to be after the election. We study: a. How does affective polarization relate to perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting? b. Is there a link between perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting and satisfaction with/acceptance of the election results? We test our preregistered hypotheses using original survey data from USA, Brazil and Italy. The results inform scholars about the extent to which affective polarization is connected to citizens’ views on the electoral process.

Yet, prior studies on the relationship between AP and democratic support show mixed results: Some scholars document negative correlations (Armaly & Enders 2022; Wagner 2021), whereas others show the opposite (Guedes-Neto 2022). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that a certain degree of AP could be beneficial for democratic support by increasing the stakes of politics and stimulating a feeling of involvement with the democratic system (Mason 2018). In contrast, extreme levels of AP may erode support by driving a negative view of politics as an intense strife over power and a potential threat to the status of one’s preferred party (Armaly & Enders 2022). As such, we propose that the relation between affective polarization and democratic support may not be strictly linear, but instead negatively curvilinear. We employ Generalized Additive Modelling on data from the Comparative National Elections Project to test this hypothesis.

While a large literature documents the behaviour and responses to these movements, work has yet to examine and expand upon theoretical explanations for variations in state responses. In this paper, I interrogate the link between political opportunity structures and aggressive protest policing. I argue police officers are more likely to apply aggressive policing toward protest movements conditional on ideology and local political climate. I test these expectations in the case of the United States, with granular data on protests and police interventions between 2017 and 2022. Keywords: repression, police brutality, protests, left-wing, right-wing, biasness, violence

Public attitudes toward Indigenous self-determination policies in Norway and Sweden	Most states acknowledge the significance of Indigenous peoples’ right to self-determination as a provision of rectificatory justice. Yet, on the domestic level, the realization of that right is governed by national policies. In democratic societies, the question of the public’s opinion toward Indigenous self-determination is thus of great interest. Does the ethnic majority rather support or oppose policies facilitating self-determination, and to what extent? And are the Indigenous population’s policy preferences different? So far, very little is known about public attitudes toward Indigenous policies. I aim to contribute here by investigating opinions toward Indigenous policies among the ethnic majority and Indigenous Sámi populations of Norway and Sweden. In accordance with group threat theory, I hypothesize that the majority’s aversion should grow with the extent to which a policy facilitates Indigenous self-determination. In contrast, the Indigenous people should be more supportive of such policies. Preliminary results based on original survey data show a more nuanced picture. Even though the majority generally shows less support for self-determination-enhancing policies, it still prefers them over policies that substantially restrict Sámi self-determination.

Religious traditions have tools for conflict resolution, repentance, and even reconciliation. How are congregations using the tools of religion to engage questions of racial justice? Our answers come through a multimethod data set collected over two years: (a) surveys of 2,293 congregants from 35 diverse congregations find that race relations is the issue they most want their place of worship to address; (b) 90 sermons from 15 congregations reveal how clergy talked about race in the weeks after Floyd’s murder depended on racial background; and (c) 21 clergy interviews illustrate differences in how congregations use religion to engage on racial issues. These diverse data demonstrate that congregations are engaging in faith-based racial justice, but with important differences that fall along both racial and religious lines. Qualitative and quantitative evidence shows more frequent and deeper engagement in the issue of race from minority religious traditions—Muslims, Jews, and Baha’is—and from Black and multiethnic congregations.

Disentangling the effect of schooling on political beliefs in adulthood	The causal role of educational experiences in shaping political behaviour has received extensive attention in recent years. However, measurement of education is often limited in political surveys, with little detail beyond the highest level of qualification achieved. Consequently, it is often still a “black box”, with few possibilities to understand precisely how people’s education shapes their views in later life. We use new administrative and survey data to address this question. Specifically, we are able to link detailed administrative data on adults’ school records to their political views in a large-scale probability household panel survey, and analyse a succession of schooling reforms in England that affected the subjects offered to students in different schools. This allows us to understand whether it is the level of attainment, or rather the educational content and self-selection into different pathways that explain large effects of education on attitudes and electoral behaviour in England. Our results contribute to our understanding of the ways that educational expansion have shaped patterns of social and political conflict.

Prior studies have increasingly been able to identify as-if random variation in educational attainment to establish that college education increases voter turnout. However, it remains a large empirical challenge to assess the mechanisms through which education affects political participation. The current study presents causally credible evidence on this question. Specifically, theories suggest that the peer composition and curriculum associated with different areas of study affects participation in politics by providing relevant resources and knowledge. To test these theories, I leverage a regression discontinuity in university admissions in Denmark that randomly assigns applicants on the margin to different majors. Using population-wide administrative data on both admissions and voting, I show whether social sciences, compared to other fields of study, provide an experience that is conducive to democratic engagement. Furthermore, some applicants are on the margin between being admitted to university in the given year or not. Using this margin, I investigate whether the effects of admission run through immediate socialization effects or longer term human/economic capital accumulation effects.

Does education also serve as an indicator of an identity-based division with in-group and out-group prejudicial biases? This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of more than eighty (conjoint) experiments that vary the educational attainment of profiles across a variety of different political scenarios. We focus on those studies that include respondent-level education in order to test if education operates as a social identity that biases preferences towards of others to reflect education-based homophily. The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that education does indeed operate as social identity. The positive in-group and negative out-group bias is, however, not symmetric across individuals of different levels. Those with university-level education demonstrate, on average, far more group-based biases than those without a degree suggesting that part of the identity formation process results from advancing in education itself.

Bringing together insights from the literature on value formation, educational choice and social mobility, I present a theoretical model that considers jointly the effects of familial income and libertarian-authoritarian values in the selection of individuals into HE, as well as the subsequent ‘allocation' of graduates into high-income positions. As this selection-and-allocation mechanism is iterated across generations with rising shares of HE participation, the model yields two predictions: cohorts with higher HE enrolment rates should present (1) higher levels of polarisation over cultural issues between graduates and non-graduates, and (2) lower levels of polarisation over redistribution between rich and poor. The theory is tested via the analysis of pseudo-panel data, where the attitudinal dependent variables are derived at country-cohort-period level for education and income groups via a Bayesian IRT model drawing from over 1m respondents surveyed in 36 countries over more than 30 years in a variety of cross-national surveys.

Social closure of the educated increases contemporary political divides.	In Europe, citizens with and without tertiary education hold different views on immigration and European integration, and increasingly vote for new left and far right parties. What explains education-based political divides? The dominant explanation in the literature holds that attending higher education ‘liberalizes’ people, but empirical evidence is mixed. This paper draws on sociological literature about social influence in networks to put forward a novel explanation. It argues that social closure of the educated increases contemporary political divides. In contrast to only a few decades ago, a large proportion of educated individuals surround themselves primarily with other educated individuals. This limits interaction opportunities and the formation of relationships between those with and without tertiary education. Using survey data from the ESS, and panel data from Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, we demonstrate that the education level of an individual’s parents, partner and wider network exerts an independent influence on their political attitudes and voting behaviour. Then, applying our networks approach to the mixed findings on liberalization effects, we show that often, education only liberalizes those from uneducated backgrounds.

A substantial body of work addresses the link between political trust and preferences over government redistribution, yet the findings are mixed. In this paper, I reconcile these findings and shed new light on the importance of political trust. First, us-ing four pre-registered survey experiments, I show that experimentally-manipulatedtrust has no downstream consequences on individuals’ preferences over governmentspending. Second, I show using 19-year panel data from Switzerland that individuals’ changing trust judgements have no relationship with preferences over social spending or tax increases, but differences in trust judgements between people do. I suggest that cross-sectional evidence may be overstating the importance of trust, but experimental or panel evidence may understate it, leading to conflicting findings in the literature. Substantively, I argue trust is socialised in early-life and acts as a long-term ‘reservoir of support’ for government action.

A cross-national experiment	Understanding the effects of transparency on compliance with social norms is vital to human cooperation. Transparency is usually regarded as a desirable normative property in democratic decision-making, ignoring that transparency about uncooperative agents can also crowd out good intentions. Therefore, this study tests how transparency about the norm of solidarity within a social group impacts solidarity behavior. It is argued that lacking transparency leads to moderate but stable levels of solidary, while transparency leads to unstable levels of high or low solidarity. To test these expectations, respondents play the Selten and Ockenfels (1998) solidarity game with ten repetitions in partner-matching with monetary rewards. In the limited transparency conditions, respondents are informed about their payoff and the payoff of their group members. In the full transparency condition, participants are informed about their payoffs and the solidarity behavior of their group members. The control group gets no feedback at all. The web-based interactive experiment is conducted on representative samples from Austria and Germany (N ~ 2,200). Findings of the pre-registered experiment will be presented, and their theoretical implications will be discussed.

The effect of exposure to inequalities during childhood on support for the political system in adulthood	It is a long-standing claim within political science that economic inequality leads to dissatisfaction with democracy and a concomitant distrust in politics and the state. Cross-national studies show a negative relationship between economic inequality and citizens’ political system support. However, these findings are vulnerable to bias from confounding. More recent studies using designs less vulnerable to confounding suggest that inequality has a limited impact on political system support. In this paper, we suggest that it is too early to dismiss the impact of inequalities on political system support. We argue that exposure to inequalities during one’s childhood and formative years leaves lasting marks on one’s political system support. We test this argument in Denmark, linking geo-referenced surveys to population data that enables us to create a range of neighborhood-level measures of inequality during respondents’ childhood and formative year. We look at a wide range of support for the political system measures, using different indicators of income inequalities, at different levels of aggregation.

Missing, however, is the crucial question whether perceived inequalities alter individuals’ preferences for democratic governance altogether. In our paper, we study if SGRD has the potential to undermine individuals’ support for a democratic regime. We argue that those perceiving their in-group as relatively deprived are likely to support democracy vis-à-vis authoritarian rule. Perceptions of being systematically disadvantaged fuel disaffection with and resentment against the prevailing democratic system, whereas authoritarian systems with their strongmen leadership appear appealing to individuals by promising stronger protection of the in-group and pursuing more confrontational in-group-out-group relations. Based on original survey data including a panel study from six European democracies between 2020 and 2022, we show that SGRD has the potential to undermine citizens' democratic support.

Missing, however, is the crucial question whether perceived inequalities alter individuals’ preferences for democratic governance altogether. In our paper, we study if SGRD has the potential to undermine individuals’ support for a democratic regime. We argue that those perceiving their in-group as relatively deprived are likely to support democracy vis-à-vis authoritarian rule. Perceptions of being systematically disadvantaged fuel disaffection with and resentment against the prevailing democratic system, whereas authoritarian systems with their strongmen leadership appear appealing to individuals by promising stronger protection of the in-group and pursuing more confrontational in-group-out-group relations. Based on original survey data including a panel study from six European democracies between 2020 and 2022, we show that SGRD has the potential to undermine citizens' democratic support. This also holds for within-subject changes within individuals as shown by fixed-effects panel analyses. Our study highlights the negative impact of subjective inequality on support for democracy by combining literature from political psychology and political economy.

Does culture affect popular support for gender equality? Though it is widely assumed that culture matters for gender outcomes, evidence showing the causal effect of culture is still scarce. This is due to an important empirical challenge, which is to isolate culture from intervening factors, such as institutions and economic factors. This paper addresses this gap by exploiting an unique setting allowing to separate the effect of culture from other factors influencing citizens’ preferences. Specifically, I take advantage of Switzerland’s linguistic border, which sharply divides French and German language regions. Using language as a proxy for culture, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) to investigate the link between culture and local support for women’s voting rights. Analyzing the outcome of two national direct democratic votes on suffrage extension in 1959 and 1971, I find that support for female suffrage was significantly higher among voters living in French-speaking municipalities compared to voters in German-speaking municipalities. Additional analysis reveals that this cultural divide can also be observed in other issues touching gender equality.

Recent advances in political knowledge and misinformation research suggest the need to take “confidence in knowledge” more seriously. Without measuring confidence in knowledge, in addition to the accuracy of the information one holds, we cannot distinguish the mere uninformed from the ones who are confidently wrong (the """"""""misinformed""""""""). Previous studies have found that women are generally less confident in various domains such as science and finance, but little is known about political knowledge. When it comes to the accuracy of factual knowledge, it has been widely documented that women demonstrate a generally lower level of scores, but more recent studies have found it is not always the case. This paper aims to examine the presence and the extent of gender differences in the likelihood of being “confidently wrong” about factual political knowledge using an original survey in the UK that asked respondents’ confidence in their answers for each of the knowledge items they had to answer. The dataset also allows for examining the misinformation gender gap across domains of political knowledge and question formats.

In a fast-paced dating world where much interaction takes place online via platforms like Tinder, individuals may rely on visual heuristics to make advance judgements about whether a prospective romantic or sexual partner is likely “one of us” or not. Do political shortcuts, that result in the projection of group-based identities, shape individuals’ dating preferences? To answer this question, we leverage a pre-registered visual conjoint experiment manipulating AI-generated dating app profiles, assessing to what extent dynamics of assortative mating are being consolidated by political inferences individuals project onto others. The results of our visual conjoint, fielded among a well-powered cross-national representative sample of respondents from the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US, demonstrate that political projection does indeed result in assortative processes which are likely to exacerbate the affective polarisation that emerges from social sorting.

In this paper, we estimate the impact of RCV on the electoral chances of women and racial minorities using difference in differences and data from California's local elections where four cities introduced RCV for certain political offices between 2004-2018. Our findings show a large, positive effect of RCV on the electoral chances of racial minorities in open-seat elections, but no effect on women. We further conduct a series of robustness checks for our results and study the mechanisms of these findings.

Factors such as the economy, immigration or identity politics are the usual suspects in this research stream. We know less about factors that contribute to the sustained growth of radical-right parties after an initial breakthrough. One argument holds that these parties benefit especially from the visibility that they gain when they win elections. The present study attempts to isolate the unique effect of visibility and overcome empirical limitations by focusing on the two-round system as applied in legislative and local elections in France. We use election data from 1978 to 2019 at the constituency and local level and leverage the quasi-random nature of runoff qualification in the French electoral system to gauge the effect of the presence of radical-right parties that barely crossed the threshold – and hence gained visibility without necessarily winning the election – on radical-right success in the closest next election. This study contributes to the broader literature on the conditions that explain the electoral success of radical-right parties.

One argument holds that these parties benefit especially from the visibility that they gain when they win elections. The present study attempts to isolate the unique effect of visibility and overcome empirical limitations by focusing on the two-round system as applied in legislative and local elections in France. We use election data from 1978 to 2019 at the constituency and local level and leverage the quasi-random nature of runoff qualification in the French electoral system to gauge the effect of the presence of radical-right parties that barely crossed the threshold – and hence gained visibility without necessarily winning the election – on radical-right success in the closest next election. This study contributes to the broader literature on the conditions that explain the electoral success of radical-right parties.

Drawing on research on the so-called integration paradox suggests that over time immigrants adapt their expectations to the host society. What remains largely unaddressed is that immigrants’ trust varies substantially across immigrant-receiving countries, which points to the role of differences in institutions and political representation. This study examines how national and regional institutional quality, as well as right-wing populist party success, influences immigrants’ political trust. Empirical results from multilevel models with macro-unit and time fixed effects using survey data from the European Social Survey (2008-2018) combined with regional and national data shows that increases in regional populist radical right party success relate to decreasing trust levels of immigrants, particularly for first-generation immigrants. Further analyses tracking potential mechanisms find that this relationship is largely due to increases in perceived discrimination and lack of political representation.

Against previous research, this book project argues that this is not due to an increase in radical right preferences among the electorate. Instead, these increases are driven by individuals who had long held radical-right views, but who would not display them because they thought they were not socially acceptable. This self-sanctioning affected political supply, making worse candidates self-select into politics under a radical-right platform. Once better politicians start running in radical right platforms, they are able to mobilize the muted support for radical-right views. In so doing, voters learn that their views were more acceptable than they had previously thought, and become more comfortable publicly displaying their views. I test these expectations using novel measures, experiments, and sources of data which disentangle what individuals think in private from what they admit and do in public.

Western societies have witnessed a dramatic surge of hate crimes against minorities. We argue that right-wing populist parties (RPPs) have provided a breeding ground for racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and ultimately political violence. Based on social identity theory, we posit that RRPs mobilize support among an imagined in-group against a supposedly harmful out-group by employing aggressive rhetoric that depicts minorities as a threat which increases the readiness to commit hate crimes against minorities. We test our argument by leveraging a new dataset covering more than 70,000 hate crimes committed between 2010 and 2020 that we collected from police authorities in Germany. We rely on a difference-in-difference design that exploits the varying entry dates of the AfD into local legislatures to causally identify the effect of the AfD on hate crimes. To shed light on the mechanism, we analyze survey data on political attitudes and perform a quantitative text analysis of AfD social media posts. Our results have major implications for the debate on polarization, political violence and the consequences of radical right populism.

For radical-right populist parties (RRPPs), however, anecdotal evidence suggests that scandals may not have any of these consequences, but systematic evidence is lacking. In this study, I exploit a natural experiment, specifically an unexpected event during survey design, to causally identify the impact of scandals using the German Alternative for Germany as a case. As the party and its prominent figure Alice Weidel were involved in a party donation scandal which unfolded during the fieldwork of the ninth wave of the European Social Survey in 2018, the timing of the survey provides exogenous variation in respondents’ knowledge about the incident. The results show that there is no significant effect of the scandal on trust in politicians. Furthermore, there is no evidence for a moderating effect of sympathizing with the party. These findings have broader implications for research on political accountability since the RRPP’s misconduct is not punished, undermining this central democratic concept.

Social Media Strategies During Protests in Democratic Contexts	Recent research indicates that autocracies engage in information diffusion online to deal with threats arising from collective action. We ask whether this behavior is exclusive to authoritarian regimes, and to what extent. This study examines the prevalence of using social media as a tool to control public opinion outside autocracies. We argue that two types of threats can prompt politicians in democracies to deploy diffusion tactics on social media during protests akin to those employed by autocratic governments: (1) when they represent electoral threats to incumbents and (2) when they are about a salient issue on which parties disagree internally. Using topic modeling with Twitter data of political elites during popular protest events from the US, Colombia, and Chile, our results suggest that politicians in democracies attempt to shift the narratives away from protests when perceiving them as threats. Our results show that previous findings from autocratic contexts are not exclusive to non-democracies. This has implications for our understanding of elite behavior in the face of unrest and unveils potential threats in the context of democratic backsliding.

We explore this question through the lenses of political psychology and hypothesize that an increasing gap between the rich and the poor may be stimulating the success of populist media content.

Our first question is if the framing of salient political issues in terms of threat or blame leads to stronger shifts in evaluations of particular political parties. If they do, this could strengthen a process known as affective polarisation. We analysed this on the basis of an experiment in which Dutch voters (N=1.872) were shown three different versions of videos on the issues of climate, immigration, and health care. These were embedded in a survey, which also measured emotional responses (12-item PANAS). Our second question is to what extent the effects observed are matched by polarised neural responses. We analysed this with an fMRI experiment using the same videos and examining subjects’ (N=25) inter-brain synchrony, where inter-subject correlations were predicted with party evaluation scores. The effects found for the blame framing suggest that anger does indeed play a role in polarised neural responses. These findings tell us that insight in brain processes can contribute to a better understanding of affective polarisation in politics.

Research on the potential causes and consequences of such growing political animosity is advancing rapidly, increasingly also focusing on multi-party systems. However, one of the core components of affective polarisation – dislike – remains fundamentally ambiguous and in need of further conceptual and empirical clarification. This paper presents an empirical study that uses semi-structured qualitative interviews to shed light on the negative evaluations, emotions and associations that individuals have when answering the dislike-based feeling thermometer questions used to measure affective polarisation. Asking respondents to elaborate on their survey responses, it tentatively shows that, 1) individuals can have multiple relevant political out-groups, 2) those out-groups are not considered homogenous - different evaluations are given to different sub-groups, mostly depending on perceived levels of ignorance, 3) initial answers are often relativized after deliberation, 4) dislike covers different discrete emotions, mainly moral emotions such as contempt and pity, which differ per out-group sub-type. The paper concludes by highlighting conceptual implications of those findings as well as implications for quantitative survey research on affective polarisation.

The effects of electoral loss on partisan support for political violence and democratic norms	Peaceful transfers of power are a fundamental tenet of democracy. Even when one’s preferred party loses, voters should still uphold democratic norms and reject political violence. Yet, in times of heightened affective polarization, partisans may react to electoral loss by weakening their support for democratic norms. We test this idea through a pre-registered survey experiment conducted after the 2022 US mid-term elections. We randomly assign Republican and Democrat partisans to receive either a placebo or an electoral loss prime in the form of a newspaper article and an open-ended survey question. All respondents then engage in a filler task before proceeding to the political violence and democratic norms questions. Within the electoral loss treatment, we also vary which emotion, anger or anxiety, is primed, allowing us to test whether partisan anger leads to stronger support for political violence and democratic norm breaking than partisan anxiety. By linking the study of partisan emotions to affective polarization, this paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of why and when partisans are ready to adopt beliefs that are harmful to democracy.

Our goal is to understand how country-specific values influence the strength and the shape of negative emotions driving AP. We argue that the key to understanding how affective polarization works, why it occurs, and how it can be tackled, is to try to understand why it varies so dramatically from country to country. Two elements are central in the mechanism we propose: the variations of values and (hence) the variation of emotions. Following a cross-cultural psychology argument, we propose that cultural norms will regulate the emotions linked to AP (e.g. anger and fear), and that positive partisanship acts as a moderator.We test this mechanism by using an online survey (about 1000 respondents per country) fielded in twelve European Western Democracies.

This article documents a gap in Affective Polarization levels and political tolerance between men and women- with women scoring lower in tolerance than men- to subsequently explore the reasons behind these differences. Through a mixed methods approach, leveraging a unique representative polarization survey fielded in Spain (N=2938) and focus groups to explore polarization and tolerance as they unfold in everyday discourses, we explore the causes behind this gap. In so doing, the paper contributes to the debate on gender differences in political tolerance, which has generated mixed evidence. Furthermore, the paper also provides new insights into gender differences in affective polarization and how they relate to political tolerance. Results point to the importance of politicized identities and emotions to explain the degree of positivity and negativity towards political groups, as well as people’s agreement or disagreement to limit their main out-group’s political expression. The results raise normative concerns about current understandings of affective polarization and political tolerance as well as their consequences. Moreover, the results point to the need to discuss the relevance of considering power relations between groups when trying to assess inter-group dynamics of negativity and conflict.

Linking migration aspirations to actual moves among a climate-vulnerable population in Bangladesh	While the academic literature agrees that climate change will alter migration patterns, it has been inconclusive about how it will do so. For examining how environmental changes translate into migration, one needs to consider both migration aspirations and the ability to move of affected populations. We investigate which factors condition whether environmental changes lead to actual moves by collecting primary survey panel data of 1700 households residing along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. We assess baseline migration aspirations of a population at risk of being affected by riverbank erosion and floods. Re-interviewing the same population after erosion and floods have materialized, we can assess whose aspirations turned into actual moves and whose did not. We find that migration materializes only for a small fraction of those who had expressed a desire to move at baseline. Socio-economic status and social networks are important conditioning factors influencing an individual’s ability to move. Our findings have significant policy implications since they provide guidance how to support the most vulnerable parts of populations at risk of becoming trapped in unfavorable environmental conditions.

Testing the influence of education on willingness to invest in solar community projects	In addition to the long-lasting urgency to tackle climate change and to transition to renewable energies, the Ukraine war has reinforced the need to rapidly reduce energy dependence and strengthen national possibilities to produce energy themselves. Solar PV enjoys high societal support and thus offers a fast and promising way to address these challenges. However, in countries with extremely low house ownership quotes like Switzerland, private solar plant installation might not suffice. Solar community projects are therefore seen as an auspicious opportunity that introduce a market-based solution, offering investment possibilities to all citizens, independent of house ownership. However, not much is known about how these projects should be designed, e.g., regarding location, project ownership, or reimbursement, to attract private investment. Further, not all groups might react identically, posing the need to differentiate between e.g. education groups in order to maximize acceptance of and investment in solar power. This study presents novel data collected in September and October 2022, and particularly tests how different education groups react to varying solar community project designs. Preliminary conjoint analyses suggest non-homogeneous education class effects.

Climate change is one of today’s most pressing problems. Yet, most governments are sluggish when it comes to climate action. One reason is that public opinion on climate change is increasingly polarized in most countries. While a predominantly young and well-educated segment of society pushes for far-reaching climate action, others are not ready to go along. One actor that plays a substantial role in this process is the media. Since media reporting can, among others, highlight the unequal consequences of climate change for today’s youth (inter-generational inequality) or rather focus on the unequal consequences of climate policies that, if not compensated, imply an unequal burden for today’s poor (intra-society inequality), different inequalities inherent in climate change (policies) can be either exacerbated or reduced in media reporting. In this paper, we investigate how different types of media portray this issue and whether media framing can exacerbate societal rifts with regard to climate action. We tackle this question relying on a comparative media analysis using multilingual dictionaries based on newspaper articles from 16 countries, 26 newspaper outlets from 2013-2020.

The relationship between political and social manifestations of affective polarization	While research on affective polarization is thriving, it has remained somewhat unclear whether the concept is best captured by feelings towards political parties, party elites or party supporters. I propose a distinction between the political and social manifestations of affective polarization, the former signifying polarized emotions towards parties/party elites and the latter towards party supporters. Some studies have shown that although affective polarization is stronger regarding the former, at least some of the party-related feelings spill over into social sphere. However, we know little about such social manifestations of affective polarization outside the US context. Moreover, it is unclear how strong is the relationship between the two manifestations, and which factors moderate this linkage. Using original survey data gathered in France, Italy, Hungary and Estonia, I aim at addressing these research gaps. I map the levels of and correlations between affective polarization as measured by party like-dislike ratings, partisan stereotyping and social avoidance items. I also study a range of identity-, ideology- and valence-related attitudes that could affect the extent to which feelings towards parties leak into social sphere.

Consistent with a long tradition of sociological findings, we first demonstrate that attachment to one’s neighborhood of residence is much higher among rural populations than in big cities. This variation in place attachment is ultimately an important font of political and policy attitudes, accounting for the gaping ideological differences between urban and rural areas. Politically relevant grievances arise most acutely when they are shared, as prevailing conditions in specific social environments. The more dissatisfied one is with the place they live, the more attractive they find the policy goals and political agenda of liberal progressivism in US politics. Greater contentment with place, on the other hand, is predictive of politically conservative viewpoints.

To examine this question, we fielded conjoint experiments in five countries differentially affected by a number of cross-cutting cleavages (Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Our respondents were asked to choose among hypothetical profiles of families moving to live next door, whose attributes varied along a number of characteristics including voting behavior, ideology, ethnic identity, education and other context-relevant features. Through random assignment of hypothetical profiles, we therefore varied the extent to which the additional political and social identities primed in the experiment overlap or not with partisan identity, so that social sorting dynamics and their impact on respondents’ social preferences can be evaluated. Our results inform our understanding of how individuals react to multiple identity primes and how this relates to affective polarization.

Alongside social and ideological sorting, one of the explanations for affective polarisation is residential segregation by partisanship. The ‘Big Sort’ has meant that neighbourhoods in the US have become more homogenous in terms of vote. Yet while there is a developing literature on the factors which make this partisan residential homogenization more likely, and the extent to which this is due to partisans seeking out fellow partisans, there is no evidence on whether homogenous partisan neighbourhoods actually influence affective polarisation. Does living cheek by jowl with fellow partisans make someone more positive towards their own side and more negative towards the other side? In this paper, we use unique data from Britain to show that while people accurately recognise that their local area is more or less politically homogenous, neighbourhood political homogeneity is not correlated with any measure of affective polarization. These findings are robust to the type of political divide (Brexit or party), the level of geography and controls for ideology and social characteristics. We suggest that geographical sorting is therefore not a major cause of affective polarization.

Yet empirical evidence on the geographic polarization of mass opinion in Europe remains scarce. We address this gap by estimating the issue domain-specific conservatism of hundreds of thousands self-reported rural and urban dwellers over four decades. For this we integrate multiple attitude questions from 223 rounds of public opinion surveys fielded in 30 countries. Acknowledging the multifaceted nature of ideological polarization, we conceptualize polarization in terms of consistency and divergence of conservatism both across (sorting, overlap) and within (constraint, heterogeneity) subgroups. We develop a Bayesian heteroscedastic graded response model that accounts for non-equivalence of questions across countries and that allows for the joint measurement of complimentary perspectives on polarization. Applying our model to assess economic, immigration, moral, and family value conservatism, our findings suggest that contemporary media narratives and existing studies overstate the extent of ideological polarization across rural-urban Europe. Our study contributes unprecedented insights into temporal and regional dynamics of ideological polarization in Europe that are relevant to current debates on inequality and representation.

We therefore bring back another geographic division into the debate: center versus periphery. What is the difference between these two geographic divides? Leveraging original survey data from Norway, we construct latent measures of rural-urban and center-periphery identities based on the strength of an individual’s attachment to these places. We then explore the extent of polarization between these identities. Using survey experiments, we examine how this polarization affects preferences for more localized versus centralized public goods provisioning. Our work helps to better understand the subnational territorial cleavage in Western democracies.

However, citizens’ perceptions of this conflict have not been explored systematically with regards to its impact on the perceived legitimacy of public policy decisions taken in a multilevel democracy. We analyse attitudes of Norwegian citizens through a survey experiment fielded to 1,200 respondents. Revealing that these perceptions indeed have an effect on the perceived legitimacy of policy decisions in Norway would imply that unitary countries are somewhat comparable to federal and regionalised countries. We hypothesise that citizens who have more peripheral attitudes to value subnational governments more, and that they will be more willing to accept decisions made by the national government if the subnational tiers indicate support for the decision. The results reveal that centre-periphery perceptions have an impact on how and to what extent diffuse support for multilevel governance translates into specific support for policy decisions. Our findings are important as they shed light to varying attitudes towards multilevel government in unitary countries.

It is often suggested that the Greens are the party family most affected by the urban-rural divide. However, until now the reasons for the urban-rural cleavage in green voting has not been explored. This article attempts to elucidate whether the division between cities and urban areas in green voting exists at the individual level, and which are the causes accounting for this potential divide. For this purpose, a propensity score matching and a cross sectional time series designs are applied to analyse the German case. The results indicate that there is a significant urban-rural polarization in green voting, and that compositional effects, rather than contextual factors, explain this cleavage. Moreover, attitudes towards the environment seem to act as an important mechanism linking social characteristics with green voting. These findings have important implications for understanding the wider consequences of postindustrial economic and cultural transformations and the effects of ecological degradation on political behaviour.

Accounting for indifferences we identify the frequencies of typical orders as well as of intransitivities. Of major interest will be whether the left-right dimension can be identified as an underlying joint scale, or whether there are several dimensions or subpopulations. Based on rank ordered logit models we statistically explain the preference orders with prominent electoral research variables (e.g. candidate evaluations, party evaluations, issue positions, coalition preferences).

An Experiment on Voting Behavior and Computational Complexity	How does the computational complexity of an electoral system affect people's voting behavior? We ran a laboratory experiment to compare people's voting behavior under Preferential Voting (known for its computational complexity) and the Borda Count (same ballot structure, but less computationally complex). We find that a smaller proportion of strategic votes is cast under Preferential Voting than under the Borda Count. We also find that participants who scored higher on a post-experiment numeracy test voted strategically in greater proportion. When a vote is repeated, more participants change their vote under Preferential Voting, which is consistent with its greater computational complexity. Finally, we identify three heuristics that have been adopted by the participants: (1) sincere voting; (2) conformity to the votes cast by the other participants; and (3) inversion at the top of the ballot. Our findings suggest that participants respond to computational complexity by adopting in greater proportion the inversion-at-the-top heuristic rather than by voting sincerely. Our findings have interesting implications for the implications of computational complexity on preference aggregation.

Information Cues and Retrospective Voting in the Case of School Closures in Sweden	While research provides evidence that voters' consider governments' past performance, little is known about which information voters pay attention to. We suggest two competing theories of retrospective voting: Outcome-oriented voters only react to the policy outcome, whereas position-oriented voters consider the initial proposal as informative of the incumbent’s policy position and punish them for the unpopular idea. We test these opposing mechanisms using the case of widely unpopular school closures and originally compiled granular data on Swedish local elections results from 2002 to 2018. We exploit within municipality variation in voting across time to causally estimate the consequences for incumbents in the neighborhood surrounding the schools. Our results confirm that voters punish incumbents for closing a school but also for withdrawing the proposal: they vote position-oriented. Our findings have implications for the understanding of retrospective voting and which information cues voters look back to.

Local and National Competitiveness as Explanatory Factors of Turnout in SMP Systems	Rooted in the rational choice theory, high stake elections are considered to attract more voters than elections where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Although measures of national level electoral competitiveness are often thought to suffice when researching proportional electoral systems, this is not the case in countries with single-member districts. Voters in single member plurality systems are likely to (also) take into account the closeness of the race in their constituency when deciding to turn out to vote or not. This paper aims to shed light on the nature of the relationship – whether competing or complementary – of local and national competitiveness on voter turnout in single member plurality systems. It does so based on the combined British Elections Studies from 1964 to 2019 to which information on the level of electoral saliency at the constituency and national level have been added. This unique dataset not only permits addressing the extent to which local and national competitiveness influence turnout in national elections. It also allows assessing which measures of competitiveness matter more or less.

Extending recent research, we develop a domain specific logic of threat-induced emotions, arguing that anger is related to the political domain and a waning of political support, while fear is more associated with the social domain and an erosion of social cohesion. We find evidence for this logic in a randomized experiment on the threat of infectious diseases - COVID-19 and monkeypox - among a representative sample of 2,800 adults in Germany. Moreover, this logic contributes to our understanding of the role of anger in the formation of conspiracy beliefs as a current challenge to democracy. Additional analyses of comprehensive survey data from six countries (N=18,000) corroborate the experimental evidence and suggest that our findings are generalizable to different contexts. Our study has crucial implications because seminal studies on political culture stress that political support and social cohesion are critical to the survival of democracy. In times of global threats, the issue is even more pressing.

Threat rhetoric shapes policy preference formation. While the relation of this link is becoming a stylized fact, the underlying causal mechanism remains unclear. We argue that strategic emotional appeals in threat rhetoric evoke different emotions within the receiver, which in turn mediate the support for policies on the freedom-security nexus. Based on the theoretical model of appraisal and dimensions of affective response, we expect that threat situations described as uncertain trigger anxiety and turn policy preferences towards security. In contrast, a threat situation described as under control is violating norms and leads to anger which enhances freedom preferences. Applied to the case of migration in Germany we conduct a survey experiment with a treatment based on media articles. We employ a novel parallel encouragement design for a causal mediation analysis. This design allows for experimental manipulation of the mediator, which provides a strong causal identification strategy. The paper contributes to the in-depth understanding of how strategic threat rhetoric impacts democratic preferences by European citizens. We extend existing knowledge by investigating the mediating effect of emotions.

How does the ideological motive behind a security threat affect public opinion?Previous research has shown that outgroup biases and prejudices influence the threat perception of citizens in Western democracies. Individuals are more likely to identify a crime as terrorism and to support the use of extraordinary detention practices when committed by a Muslim than by White supremacists. This study analyses the causal effect of ideology on individuals’ threat perception and support for restrictive state countermeasures. Based on ingroup and outgroup explanations, I argue that while extreme right threats are perceived as incidents committed by lone actors, Islamist threats are perceived as a collective thread associated with the broader group of Muslims. Empirically, I draw on experimental evidence from a representative sample of the German population. By conducting a 2 x 2 between subjects’ experiment, I test the influence of the ideological motive on perceptions of threats and extremism and support for restrictive counter measures. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how prejudices shape public opinion and policy preferences.

Hungary is one of several countries where partisans on all sides make claims about ‘fake news’ and the risks of political dis- and misinformation. However, these similar claims have different partisan valences and those have major impacts on trust in European and domestic institutions. The autocratizing national government emphasizes fake news coming from the rest of Europe, outside Hungary (as well as from “foreign-backed” journalists), while the opposition points to fake news coming from inside Hungary, as a result of the government’s heightened control of the media environment. Using data from an original survey fielded just prior to the April 2022 national election, we examine how partisan differences in perceptions of fake news affect other aspects of elections, participation, and campaigning in Hungary and to represent how this challenge could play out in other European Union members in a worst-case scenario.

The autocratizing national government emphasizes fake news coming from the rest of Europe, outside Hungary (as well as from “foreign-backed” journalists), while the opposition points to fake news coming from inside Hungary, as a result of the government’s heightened control of the media environment. Using data from an original survey fielded just prior to the April 2022 national election, we examine how partisan differences in perceptions of fake news affect other aspects of elections, participation, and campaigning in Hungary and to represent how this challenge could play out in other European Union members in a worst-case scenario.

First empirical evidence points to the existence of a rally-around-the-flag-effect whereby individuals react to uncertainty with higher levels of trust. However, these analysis have mostly focused on national-level institutions, during the early stages of the pandemic and using data from consolidated democracies. This paper contributes to the literature by looking beyond immediate effects and exploring the association between individuals’ satisfaction with COVID-19 performance of local level institutions and political trust in Nepal. For that, it uses novel data collected via telephone interviews (N=1,400) conducted between April and May 2021, during the 2nd wave of COVID-19. Main results reveal that satisfaction with local institutions’ COVID-related performance is significantly and robustly associated with higher levels of political trust at the local level. These results suggest that not only psychological effects triggered by unexpected crisis but also performance can explain increases in political trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study thereby provides important insights on the role performance plays beyond the national level and in unconsolidated political systems.

However, these terms carry distinct connotations, which we argue have diverging second-order effects on how citizens view public employees of the administrative state. Indeed, the term “bureaucracy” has a pejorative etymology, dating back to the eighteenth century when the term was coined to disparage governments run by unelected administrators and desk jockeys. Based on the term's history, we hypothesize that bureaucratic depictions of public employees should negatively affect survey respondents' perceptions of their trustworthiness and competence. We test this hypothesis with two separate equivalence framing experiments and find that describing public employees as either “bureaucrats” or “government bureaucrats” instead of “government employees” leads respondents to view them as significantly less trustworthy and more corrupt. We further examine our results for heterogeneous treatment effects across several key political predispositions and find that respondents who are low in social dominance orientation (SDO) are more likely to change their attitudes toward public employees in response to bureaucratic depictions.

Yet, it is often argued that it is not inherently problematic if the public has little trust in politicians because they can be replaced every electoral cycle (e.g., Dalton, 2004; Norris, 2011). This assumes that people reset their level of trust in new politicians to a neutral baseline level. But do they? Using a conjoint experiment (n~1500; fielded in Belgium in Spring 2023), the proposed study would uncover if people’s trust in politicians is driven by them being or becoming politician for a living – rather than by what they stand for or how they behave. It allows to see if merely being politician makes them seen as untrustworthy by the general public. For instance, do people have less trust in politicians whose opinions align with their own compared to citizens with a different profession whose opinions differ from their own? If so, this could have far-reaching implications for the quality of representation, the role of elections, and democracy as rule by the people.

We argue that this approach will: embed public support for democracy within the concept of liberal democracy; provide for more tangible and valid measures; and permits insight into the particular features of liberal democracy which publics find the least compelling.

Yet almost everything we know about support for democracy is based on survey measures which are generally agreed to be limited, if not deeply flawed. Our understanding of support for democracy, its causes, and its consequences for democracy, is therefore more questionable than we would like to admit. In response, we propose a new approach to measuring support for democracy. Instead of asking people about their approval of “democracy”, an abstract and complex concept, we propose asking instead about public approval of the more granular rights, institutions, and processes which collectively constitute “liberal democracy”. We argue that this approach will: embed public support for democracy within the concept of liberal democracy; provide for more tangible and valid measures; and permits insight into the particular features of liberal democracy which publics find the least compelling.

However, this perception disregards the rising number of inhabitants in democratic countries that cannot vote at national elections. This exlusion not only affects those below the voting age but also those with foreign citizenship. For example, in Germany, about 8 million inhabitants of voting age that largely follow the same obligations as other citizens are deprived of the most essential form of political participation. How does the exclusion from basic rights affect individuals’ support for democracy, the democratic system and its institutions? We rely on data from the DeZIM.panel, a random sampled, online access panel of the German residential population, oversampling immigrants with more than 3,000 participants, using two recent waves fielded one year apart. We analyse how electoral exclusion relates to specific and diffuse support for democracy compared to similar individuals with citizenship. We argue that withholding the right to vote puts a political system at risk of losing its fundamental basis of support – a great danger for a democracy.

Until today such biases are treated as a nuisance at best. In contrast, we argue that social desirability biases are key to understand for social scientists as they are important proxies for social norms and the need for conformity within societies. We compare six different designs to measure social desirability bias in relation to support for democracy in three European countries. Besides a list experiment, we rely on various approaches that trigger respondents' need to provide socially acceptable answers. We show that triggering social desirability is outperforming list experiments and observational measures for various reasons. Most importantly it allows researchers to test whether social desirability is actually manipulated. It also ensures that social desirability is not treated as a nuisance but as a matter of substantive research interest.

But can we trust these findings? How firm are democracy’s societal foundations really when democratic beliefs are put under pressure? We argue that support for democracy is best understood as a social attitude that reflects perceived opinions in a person’s social environment. As such, under contemporary circumstances, social mechanisms help reinforce widespread support for democracy but in a downward spiral the popularity of democracy may quickly crumble once exogenous shocks visibly undermine popular support. To test these predictions, this Registered Report introduces a new experimental paradigm to the study of democracy’s societal foundations. Revising Ash-style conformity experiments and applying them to democratic attitudes in a conversational setting we will bring Norwegian citizens together in small groups for political and unpolitical conversations. In each of these groups, we will randomly vary the numbers of confederates who will adopt pro- or anti-democratic stances. This research design will help us explore whether ordinary citizens remain committed supporters of democracy even in a social environment that is hostile to democracy.

The guiding assumption has been that behind ethnic minorities' overwhelming support for Remain lay a rejection the ethnocentric Leave campaign, which minorities found threatening. This placed minority voters within the same camp as white voters who rejected the ethnocentric Leave camp on the basis of their convictions, rather than a sense of threat, thus leading to the hypothesis that minorities are """"""""liberals"""""""" by necessity, as opposed to conviction. We use data from a new ethnic minority booster to the 2019 British Election Study to test exactly how liberal minority voters are, on what measures and under which conditions. Evidence from these data is consistent with the necessity liberalism hypothesis, and once we account for necessity liberalism of minority voters, we find there is no ethnic gap in how people voted on 23rd of June 2016.

Although this statements has important normative implications for democracy, it has not been systematically tested at the global level. Using CSES survey data, we find that although respondents are not less likely to vote for their favorite party than 30 years ago, they tend to likes less and less the parties for which they vote. This is part of a more general trend of decreasing party likings across the board. Further, we explore the democratic implications of this trend for democracy by checking its association with representation and accountability.

We are interested in how (un)familiarity with a voting modality may shape voters’ confidence in elections, particularly when faced with allegations by elites challenging the legitimacy of the electoral process. Drawing on a large panel survey of validated voters conducted before and after the 2020 General Election, we find that mail voters were more confident that votes would be accurately counted than those who usually vote in person, despite elites repeated claims that mail ballots were fraudulent. We also find that those who voted by mail in the 2020 election became more confident that votes were accurately counted. This study challenges existing research examining voting and confidence in elections and suggests that voters are willing to rebuff elite cues disavowing their usual voting practice.

Citizens must hold accurate beliefs about politically-relevant facts to preserve democratic representation, accountability and legislation. We theorize that, abstracting from one's background, schooling per se does not trigger the epistemological sophistication necessary to get a grasp of the political world. In this paper, we study whether schooling improves the accuracy of factual beliefs about the share of foreigners and unemployed, later in life. We derive an appealing metric of belief accuracy, matching survey respondents' beliefs with the corresponding real-world datum at the time of the interview in their country, retrieving high levels of inaccuracy in both issues. More educated individuals display higher belief accuracy, most likely due to selection, rather than causality: compelling otherwise-dropouts to stay in school by extending compulsory education entails a null effect on belief accuracy, in both issues. Taken together, cross-sectional and causal estimates suggest that education is necessary, but not sufficient, to contrast inaccurate beliefs.

While literature on the consequences of polarization is burgeoning, these studies typically face two concerns: endogeneity and omitted variables. I contribute to this literature and argue that polarization among candidates can affect the functioning of democracy by fostering voters’ coordination around incumbents thus decreasing turnover. I test the hypotheses by applying a Regression Discontinuity Design to data from legislative and cantonal elections in France. These elections use a two-round system in which the two most voted candidates in the first round automatically qualify for the second round. Following the logic of ‘close race elections’, I compare cases in which the runner-up candidate that barely qualifies for the second round polarizes the election, with cases in which that candidate did not qualify, decreasing the degree of polarization. I find that polarization decreases incumbent turnover by fostering voters' coordination around them. This effect is particularly strong when polarization comes from the presence of extreme candidates in the second round. These results have clear implications for our understanding of the consequences of polarization.

There is however a third option that has received much less attention: that voters care about the economic conditions of their social in-group. In this paper, I provide a theoretical framework and first experimental test of how voters react to changes to the economic conditions of their social in-group that is independent of their own pocketbook. I implement a pre-registered and replicated survey experiment that uses true economic information about social groups to manipulate respondents’ group-level economic perceptions across 22 different class-, age-, geographical and education-groups. I find evidence that voters exhibit a unique negative reaction to in-group economic decline, in particular when the decline is relative to the national economic trend. Effects persist for both satisfaction with the economy and vote choice. These findings suggest that we have underestimated the importance of social group attachments to the way voters think about the economy.

Scholars have argued that one explanation might be people’s distorted perception of income inequality. The origins of this mis-perception are still unclear. Specifically, the role of ideology remains under-explored and the little research focuses almost exclusively on the United States. However, if distortions in perceptions of inequality have an ideological leaning, this could have severe consequences for how these views get translated in the political system. Taking advantage of a new survey on inequality perceptions, we are able to assess how citizens’ ideology affects their inequality evaluations across 13 Western countries. We test how ideology influences people’s ability to assess the overall level of inequality around them. In a second study, we verify the causal mechanism through an innovative survey experiment leveraging respondents’ ideological identification. The contribution of this work is double-fold: firstly, we shed new light on the phenomenon of inequality by looking at its psychological roots and secondly, we examine one of its potential explanation comparatively.

Contributing to recent debates about the nature of this effect of partisan influence, we ask when and how partisan cheerleading becomes (negative) ‘bias’ and when and how it becomes a (positive) ‘effective heuristic process’. We propose that an increasing ideological presence in government also provides control of the public narrative about the utility of particular issues as the best metric for evaluating national economic performance. When this issue narrative takes place, winners’ RSEE’s are more likely to align with the actual performance of the national economy. Using survey data from the European Elections Studies, party data from the Comparative Political Dataset, and macro-economic performance data from the World Bank, we find strong and consistent evidence for the issue narrative approach.

A survey experiment	To slow down the consequences of climate change, mitigation policies often require changes in people's attitudes and behaviour. Yet, while diffuse support for mitigation policies tends to be high, specific support for certain policies may bring about a tension between what the policy requires (a new tax, strict regulations, prohibitions, etc) and a change in people's attitudes and behaviour. This paper explores the trade-off between different aspects of climate mitigation policies by confronting individuals with several scenarios and their consequences. We examine this question with a conjoint experiment, as well as several vignette experiments, embedded in a survey conducted at the end of 2022. The survey was conducted in Spain and is representative of different areas of the Spanish territory, with varying degrees of climate change incidence and, therefore, with potential effects on the individual's understanding of the trade-off between climate policies and people's attitudes and behaviour. Our article has important implications for our understanding of the conditions under which climate change policies can be successfully implemented.

I examine the causal link between environmental changes and migration drawing on the theoretical framework of the need, desire, and ability to move of affected populations. The analysis relies on original survey panel data of 1700 households residing along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, an area heavily affected by environmental changes, in particular floods and riverbank erosion. Controlling for individual level characteristics such as gender, age, risk attitudes, and migrant networks, I relate respondents’ perception of riverbank erosion and floods (need), migration aspirations (desire) and education/occupation/wealth (ability) to their likelihood to move away from their place of origin. I find that erosion significantly increases the propensity to migrate, while flooding has a significant effect only if it leads to severe and irreversible impacts. These findings have significant policy implications by underlining the nuanced relationship between different types of environmental shocks and migration, which should be reflected in policies aiming at supporting populations-at-climate risk.

Extreme weather, political orientation and climate attitudes in Norway	As the concrete threats posed by climate change proliferate around the globe, understanding the impact of extreme weather events on environmental attitudes becomes increasingly important. Research has identified that left-wing (compared to right-wing) individuals are more likely to attribute extreme weather events to climate change and alter environmental attitudes after experiencing them, but questions remain about the causes of these ideological divides. Using longitudinal data from the Norwegian Citizen Panel (2018 – 2019), this paper tests the proposition that differences in need for cognition (the desire to undertake complex thinking) explain the existence of ideological divides in extreme weather response. Specifically, I employ person-level fixed effects to assess within-individual variation in climate change attitudes before and after flood exposure, and how the attitudinal impact of flood exposure is moderated by ideology and need for cognition, controlling for stable individual characteristics. In doing so, this paper represents a novel assessment of the role of need for cognition in shaping climate attitudes and responses to extreme weather and can provide new insight into the relationship between ideology and climate change.

Framing the Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Twitter	This study examines how the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and NATO's involvement in the invasion are portrayed in English-, Russian-, and German-language Twitter communities. We use computational and quantitative methods to analyze tweets from February to May 2022. Results show that the role of NATO in the war is framed differently across the three language communities, with English-speaking tweeters being more likely to hold NATO responsible for finding a solution and least likely to blame NATO for the war. Additionally, the Russian-speaking Twitter community is less likely to blame NATO for the war than the German-speaking community and is the least likely of all three communities to expect NATO to provide a solution for ending the war. This study contributes to the understanding of how social media conversations can promote political agendas in times of war, serving as a vehicle for framing, and provides further insight into the framing of war and conflict literature.

With this focus on domestic channels of communication, relevant research has overlooked the strategic use of global media platforms for openly attacking prominent regime critics. Accordingly, I develop an analytical framework for studying digital transnational repression in the public sphere. Combining theoretical perspectives from the relevant scholarship on digital repression and foreign influence operations, I outline (1) how state-aligned media attacks can vary based on who is targeted, (2) the extent of plausible deniability in state attribution, and (3) whether media attacks are temporally aligned with other instances of state repression. I highlight how these sources of variation manifest in the transnational information environment and outline how researchers can leverage social media data to understand these dynamics. Overall, this paper contributes a novel conceptual and empirical basis for studying the strategic repertoires of digital transnational repression on global media platforms.

The same connections that allow them to get things done, however, also pose a risk of being captured by or colluding with powerful groups to advance private interests, thereby undermining the public good. This paper shows empirically that the local environment shapes whether public service provision is improved or harmed by a higher share of local bureaucrats. Exploiting a plausibly random assignment mechanism of members of the elite Indian Administrative Service to districts across rural India, it demonstrates that learning in (public) government schools is harmed by a higher share of local bureaucrats in low-literacy districts while it is improved in high-literacy districts. This implies that a uniform posting policy for bureaucrats across a diverse country might have contrasting effects on public goods provision, especially if the public good has (re-)distributive implications, and might reinforce divergence in the quality of public goods provided to citizens.

Regional Shared-Rule and Corruption in Presidential and Parliamentary Systems                              	Previous research found that regional shared rule reduces national level corruption. Yet, political institutions do not function in isolation, but they are usually part of a wider institutional package (as Lijphard already pointed out many years ago). Regional shared rule is no exception. We suggest that the effect of regional shared rule on political corruption is conditional on a country’s form of government. Presidentialism requires deal-making and impedes accountability. We argue that under these conditions regional representatives serve as access points for private interests and rent-seeking. In contrast, parliamentarism does not provide favorable conditions for corruption. In countries with a parliamentary system, shared rule contributes to controlling the government. This deters corrupt interactions. The results from a time-series cross-sectional analysis (56-95 countries, 1950-2018, RAI index, Vdem, ICRG, CPI and WGI data) support our expectations: shared rule stimulates corruption in countries with a presidential system but contributes to controlling corruption in countries with a parliamentary system.

As such, government officials frequently delegate to local agencies and officials to collect the raw data that is used to shape and evaluate state and federal policy. We argue that this delegation, while operationally necessary, is likely to produce data of dubious quality given substantial variation in local resource endowments. As a result, the information obtained for some areas is likely to be more accurate than others. In an analysis of the United States’ death registry, we show that this is true even in non-controversial data collection, as more populace counties produce more specific and detailed information on resident deaths. For scientists, this is a cautionary tale on the quality of official data.

Accordingly, recent empirical research has focused how policy designs (policy packages including diverse instruments) shape policy support (e.g. carbon taxation, mobility pricing), commonly adopting survey-embedded experimental designs, such as conjoint and factorial experiments. Yet, little remains known about potential differences between adopting conjoint and factorial experimental approaches to evaluate policy designs. Here, we adopt a novel methodological survey-embedded experiment to compare how policy preferences differ by factorial and conjoint designs. Further, we explore perceptions of comprehension and burden associated with experimental design choices. We find similar patterns of policy instrument support across three experimental designs conditions, while noting that conjoint experimental designs were perceived to be more burdensome and somewhat more difficult to understand. Thus, we formulate a set of recommendations, whereby factorial experimental designs are suggested for policy research focusing on specific instruments (levels). While conjoint designs are suggested for research towards identifying policy packages (combinations of levels) and sub-group differences, leveraging increased power within such experiments.

How do voters trade-off between these targeted policy proposals in their prospective evaluation of manifestos? We develop and test three hypotheses, i.e. whether citizens judge programs primarily in view of the proposals targeting the groups (1) they belong to, (2) that are majoritarily perceived as deserving or (3) through the lens of ideological representations of groups.We designed a conjoint experiment in which respondents had to choose between hypothetical sets of party manifestos addressing different social groups. The presented manifestos are based on real-world electoral pledges taken from the German 2021 legislative and the French 2022 presidential electoral campaign. Our analyses reveal that voters’ program choice varies depending on which groups are targeted in a beneficial or detrimental way, reflecting for instance the finding that senior citizens are largely perceived as “deserving” while immigrants are not (2). However, our study also reveals considerable heterogeneity in program choice, less in terms of respondents’ group membership (1) than depending on ideology (3).

Do Economic Risks Boost Redistribution Demand but Undermine Taxation Support?	Classical political economy models suggest that citizens facing economic adversity demand state redistribution. Recent single-country studies additionally suggest adversity may also reduce willingness to pay taxes (Jacques and Weisstanner 2022). It may lead to a “something for nothing” phenomenon, whereby citizens will not pay for the additional spending they demand (Edlund and Johansen Seva 2013). We test if this tendency is cushioned by satisfaction with existing public services. Moreover, we study a hard case, Norway, where support for taxes and spending are ideologically structured. Finding that Norwegians become pro-spending, but anti-tax when facing economic hardship would go against the consensus in the literature on public opinion in Nordic welfare states. Our empirical analysis uses three waves of a panel survey conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2017 allowing us to leverage variation between and within individual respondents. We study the impact of an index of perceived economic risks and an original measure of income growth on preferences for redistribution and willingness to pay taxes, along with the conditional effect of the satisfaction with public services.

How voters perceive democratic choices over economic policies	Globalization and Europeanization have restricted national autonomy over economic policies in advanced democracies and led to an increased convergence of party positions on economic issues. As a result, democracies face a responsiveness dilemma where economic choices are increasingly out of the reach of voters. Do citizens feel that they face more and more meaningless elections that do not lead to changes in economic policy? In this paper, we use novel data from a representative online survey fielded in Portugal, Spain and Germany that measures, for the first time, economic choice perceptions on the individual level. Economic choice is defined as (1) the variety of economic policy alternatives proposed by political actors (economic policy offer); and (2) the degree to which political actors are able and willing to fulfil their electoral promises once in government (economic mandate fulfilment). We aim to establish whether voters perceive their economic policy choice as limited; whether they are aware of the economic constraints that their governments face; and if a perceived lack of economic choice negatively affects support for democracy.

The electoral salience of the European integration issue in national, multidimensional policy spaces	The last decade has been characterized by rising Euroscepticism. However, we know little about how this has affected voters holding pro-European attitudes. I argue that due to multiple Europe related crises and ongoing Eurosceptic politicization, de-politicizing European issues is no longer a promising strategy for pro-European parties. Thus, pro-European parties start politicizing in a pro-European manner. By this, they mobilize pro-European attitudes which is reflected in increasing salience of the European integration issue among pro-European voters. To test this argument, I derive salience estimates directly from spatial vote models encompassing five issue dimensions. I use data from the European Social Survey, the European Election Study, and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey encompassing a wide range of EU member states between 2008 and 2019. Overall, the results point to a punctuated politicization since there is country- and time-specific variation. The salience of the European integration issue is still more pronounced among Eurosceptic voters. However, in highly politicized environments, such as the Brexit referendum, the pro-European side benefits as evidenced by converging salience levels between Eurosceptic and pro-European voters.
