2023	1718	PL17	Topic engagement of Swiss members of parliament. Is the Swiss parliament undergoing a trend of specialization?	What strategies push members of parliament (MPs) to engage in different political topics?In Switzerland, the federal parliament started as a lay parliament, where working full-time as an MP was very uncommon. However, the Swiss parliament has undergone a recent wave of professionalization, where MPs have increasingly more resources available to fulfil their parliamentary duties. Thus, we ask which strategies MPs choose to follow when choosing how to allocate their resources within their parliamentary work: Do they decide to focus on specializing on a few select topics when they submit parliamentary bills? If so, can we observe a trend of specialization of MPs in the Swiss parliament? We focus on all legislative bills sponsored (introduced) by MPs from the 47th to 50th legislative period (2003-2019), from which we extract the respective topics.These insights enable us to cover further relevant questions, for instance, whether specialized MPs are more successful in getting their bills passed in the parliament, or how these choices play into collaboration dynamics in parliament.

2023	201	PL17	Measuring Party Cohesion on Parliamentary Question Keywords	Understanding the positions of parties and legislators is key to conceptualizing party cohesion and their representation in most democracies. This paper is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attention by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time. We answer this question using the case of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan, and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from 1993 to 2020. We estimate the position of each legislator on the left-right dimensions using the keywords extracted from the questions that legislators request for information on policies and activities of ministries from executive officials. We document how the electoral reform shapes legislators' ideological position and variability on their issue attention: party cohesion increases when high variability in issue attention in Single Member District (SMD) and decreases when low variability under Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV).

2023	2031	PL17	Parliamentary rules in times of democratic erosion	Extremist political parties enter parliament with the goal to subvert its capacity to deliberate and enact legislation. They do so, by using a variety of strategies of disruption, which violate parliamentary rules and norms. These include provocation of other speakers, the use of offensive language and, even, violence. This paper examines the use of strategies of disruption and the responses of legislators of mainstream parties to these violations of parliamentary rules, distinguishing between neglect, counter-provocation and moral outrage. Using evidence from the 19th legislative period of the Bundestag, we document that electoral considerations explain the incentives of legislators from mainstream parties to engage in provocation or counterprovocation.

2023	392	PL17	Centralised Agenda Control in Westminster Democracies: Procedural Choice in the UK House of Commons, 1900-1906	Centralised agenda control is a feature of many modern parliaments. This procedural arrangement allows the executive to control the parliamentary timetable, with important consequences for the conduct and outcomes of legislative politics. Much existing literature has thus tried to understand why legislators would vote to empower the executive in this way. We explore this puzzle further by studying a major procedural milestone in the UK House of Commons: the 1902 ‘Balfour reforms’ which cemented the executive’s control of the parliamentary timetable. Combining a novel procedural dataset with historic roll-call data, we assess which factors made legislators more or less likely to support these reforms. The analysis reveals interesting patterns of inter-party and intra-party variation. We thus shed light on this important historical episode, and on the wider question of how agenda control is shaped in democratic parliaments.	NA
2023	46	PE10	Parliamentary pensions and government stability. Can economic incentives ‘transform’ MPs' votes?	Can economic incentives affect the voting behavior of policymakers? Using newly col-lected data on 427 confidence votes in the Italian Parliament between 2001-2022, I study the impact of a minimum tenure requirement of 4.5 years to obtain a parliamentary pension introduced in 2008. Using a difference-in-discontinuities design, I find that the policy increases the probability of voting confidence in the government by 3 percentage points. The reform increases confidence votes by majority MPs, whereas it decreases confidence votes by opposition MPs. These results confirm the predictions of a simple political-agency model in which policymakers have opportunistic motives. Beyond the direct incentive to keep the current government in power, the policy increases party loyalty: it induces opposition (majority) MPs to vote against (for) the government so as to increase the probability of being re-elected and reach the tenure requirement in a second term in case the government falls. Overall, tenure requirements for parliamentary benefits appear to increase government stability but also to increase the probability MPs vote against voters’ interest.	NA
2023	1546	M01	Models for multicategorical responses - improving inference and interpretation	Categorical responses are ubiquitous in social and political research. Binary logit and probit models already appear elusive to may researchers, not the least because of their intrinsic non-linearity. Even more elusive are models of responses with more than two categories. Here the values and, possibly, the statistical significance of coefficients depend on the choice of the baseline category of the response. To address this, a recent paper published in Political Analysis recommends to look at the statistical significance of differences in probabilities rather than the statistical significance of individual coefficients. I argue that such a recommendation does not help with practitioners' confusion about these models as it conflates inference with interpretation. I further show that there are established techniques of inferences in the statistician's toolbox that avoid such conflation. Third, I show that probability changes always occur if any of the coefficients in a multinomial logit model are non-zero. Finally, I present a sequential logit model that allows for some of the response probabilities to remain constant while others vary with the values of independent variables.	NA
2023	1591	M01	Communicating the Concept Structure of IRT Latent Variables	Empirical research invariably requires one to match cases to concepts. Is the US a democracy? Does Nigeria have a strong legislature? Increasingly, researchers are turning to latent variable approaches to answer these questions. The upside is great as the barriers to data and computational capacity are steadily declining. The downside is that these approaches render the concept structure a black box. Researchers know the input and perhaps even the statistical model producing the classification scores, yet they cannot communicate the resulting concept structure. Focusing on the Item Response Theory (IRT) approach to concept measurement, we offer a way to communicate what is in the black box. We argue that the items’ weights produced by IRT can be mapped onto notions of necessary and sufficient conditions traditionally used to communicate concept structure. In so doing, we show how IRT and traditional approaches can be integrated to deal with the challenging task of assigning cases to concepts.	NA
2023	205	M01	Included Variable Bias and Testing for Discrimination	Regression analysis of potential discrimination suffers from two problems: omitted variable bias and what Ayres (2005) describes as ``included variable bias.’’ The former problem is well understood, and the latter problem is not. Included variables are particularly a problem in the analysis of disparate impact cases—situations where race-neutral policies create racially disparate outcomes. Ayres notes that social scientists have yet to develop theory with which to describe this bias. I provide such a theory drawing on the literature on overadjustment. I then compare and assess through simulations various statistical solutions including outcomes tests and risk-adjusted regression.	NA
2023	63	M01	Fallacies in Statistically-Based Claims about Massive Election Fraud in 2020:A Compendium	An immense amount has been written about alleged massive electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election: In 2022, tens of millions of voters, and many Republican officials, still believe the 2020 election was stolen. Here, we examine claims of fraud in the presidential election of 2020 that are based on aggregate election data, and we further limit ourselves to claims in which the data itself is essentially undisputed. We show that the implications of that data for the presence of massive fraud have been largely or entirely misinterpreted through invalid statistical or logical reasoning. Our goal is not to provide new insights, since virtually all the points we make have been made by others, but rather to put together in one place a compendium of recent glaring misuses of statistical inference in a form that we believe will be useful as a teaching tool about the dangers of sloppy use of statistics.

2023	867	M01	Overlap in control variables in quantitative political science: Diagnosis, consequences, and ways forward	Despite the causal inference revolution, selection on observables remains one of the main approaches used in quantitative empirical political science. This approach assumes researchers can identify and measure the main variables that can confound a given relation of interest. We check how much agreement there is in the variables that are identified as potential confounders. We focus on relationships often tested in political science and identify the control variables used by each paper that tests it. We start with reporting how much overlap there is, on average, within papers testing each relationship. Then, we move to the question of whether this overlap is consequential. To that end, we check how much the results change if one were to run the analyses of one paper using the controls of other papers within the sample drawing upon the same empirical relationship. Finally, we provide some suggestions to improve subsequent practice–namely, showing that one’s results hold regardless of the constellations of controls used, and the replication of one’s findings using the constellation of controls by previous papers.

2023	24	FT01	Political Life Cycles	We develop and test a formal model of leader political life cycle effects within a selec- torate framework. The model leads to novel hypotheses about the provision of public goods, private goods, and freedoms over a leader’s tenure in power. The analyses show, as hypothesized, that the total provision of benefits, as well as the provision of public goods and freedoms decrease significantly the longer a leader is in power while the proportion of rewards in the form of private goods (such as corruption opportunities) increases. Also as hypothesized, these life cycle effects, though highly significant, are smaller than the effects of winning coalition size.	NA
2023	277	FT01	Global Media Polarization Caused by Propaganda and Censorship	We study a model of propaganda and censorship that examines under what condition the information policies of an authoritarian regime may induce worldwide media polarization. We find that propaganda has no effect on audiences' decisions in a competitive market without censorship, because the independent media always reports truthfully to build a reputation. When censorship blocks the audience's access to the independent media in an authoritarian regime, censorship induces global media polarization. In this situation, audiences under authoritarianism are influenced by propaganda and choose to support its regime. Meanwhile, the independent media tends to misreport the information about the authoritarian regime, because its reputation concern is overshadowed by the ideological concern. When the authoritarian regime adopts different propaganda strategies for domestic and foreign audiences, audiences under authoritarianism receive the least truthful information. By contrast, audiences in the liberal world receive more reliable information about the authoritarian regime.	NA
2023	534	FT01	Commitment Problems, Economic Production, and Property Rights	We investigate the relationship between economic activity and the formal institutional solutions to commitment problems—property rights. We start with the observation that the social-welfare-maximizing properties of free markets hinge on assuming a particular set of exogenous property rights. We argue that, when property rights are endogenous to markets, that set of property rights is either not attainable or requires a balanced power distribution in society. More generally, we analyze a formal model where we vary the underlying market structure—the degree to which agents depend on each other’s efforts to produce economic value—and characterize property rights that emerge in equilibrium. We argue that distribution and efficiency problems are inseparable and optimal property rights tend to function as balancers of power disparities, instead of their common interpretation as equidistant formal institutions.	NA
2023	594	FT01	A Theory of Mass and Elite Purges	This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework to study the interaction of mass and elite purges in authoritarian regimes. We contend that the decision to purge the elite and the breadth of a mass purge of agents are closely intertwined and crucially depend on how closely connected are new hires to the elite in place. If this connection is low so that the autocrat has good control of the hiring process, good performance is not always sufficient to save the elite. As the autocrat starts purging the elite, she carries out a smaller mass purge. Mass purges are, therefore, mostly used to dissuade a disloyal incumbent elite. In contrast, if the connection between agent and the elite is high, so that the latter controls the hiring process, the elite can survive poor performance. As the autocrat starts purging the elite, the breadth of the mass purge increases. Mass purges become a tool to dissuade a disloyal replacement elite.	NA
2023	597	FT01	Buying Autocratic Supermajorities	New data reveals that autocratic regimes engage in legislative vote-buying, using bribes and policy concessions to ensure MP support for policy proposals - but policies often pass with nearly unanimous support from legislators. Why would the regime purchase coalitions that far exceed the bare majority required? I develop a model of legislative vote-buying in a dictatorship with secret bribes and uncertainty about legislator preferences. The dictator values resources and policy control. Legislators' incentive to accept an offered bribe depends on their expectation that their vote is pivotal. Revealed votes in one period influence these expectations in the next. In the absence of an attempted bribe, they vote their true preferences. Revealed legislative dissent increases the dictator's cost for bribing individual legislators and raises the probability that his proposals will fail in future. Offering even a small bribe to all participants is sufficient under most conditions to disrupt legislative collective action. The results suggest coalitional over-buying is worthwhile even in scenarios where the regime experiences hegemonic support. 'Rubber-stamp' legislatures may therefore reflect regime strategic behavior rather than the state of nature.	NA
2023	1436	PL26	Resilience in new parties: the case of the Chilean Frente Amplio	Contemporary party systems are undergoing profound transformations with the decline of several parties and new organizations emergence. However, only some new parties have stood the test of time. This paper seeks to explain the factors associated with the origin and resilience of new parties in political instability and social mobilization contexts, addressing the case of the Chilean Frente Amplio. This research presents a comparative study of the trajectories of the Frente Amplio's new parties through a process tracing methodology structured on semi-structured interviews with party leaders' data. The resilience shown by the Chilean Frente Amplio is explained by its origin in the 2011 student movement, which allowed the development of networks, recruitment of leaders, and a sense of common belonging. None of these elements are present in the rest of the emerging parties in Chile. By including an under-studied case from Latin America, we seek to expand the literature on emerging parties to new regions and social contexts.	NA
2023	286	PL01	From electoral pledges to coalition agreements: coalition bargaining and policy payoffs in Germany (2002-2021)	Coalition politics are conventionally believed to constrain mandate representation: they require governing parties to find a common denominator usually formalized in a coalition agreement that shapes policymaking for the term to come. This may often imply to abandon election pledges opposed by the coalition partners. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the conditions under which parties succeed in pushing their pledges into the coalition agreement and the types of promises that have more chances to make it. Based on original longitudinal data (2002-2021) on the inclusion of German governing parties’ electoral pledges in coalition agreements (N= 6,315), we observe that Gamson’s law about portfolio payoffs also applies to policy. Second, we model the factors that affect the likelihood for single electoral pledges to find their way into the coalition agreements, focusing on parties’ parliamentary weight, intra-governmental conflict and issue salience. Our results not only further our knowledge of policymaking under coalition governments, but have also important implications for understanding mandate representation.	NA
2023	755	PL01	Do Parties Keep Their Promises in Times of Crisis? A Comparative Analysis	Several studies show how institutions, the party system and the related distribution of power influence the capacities and incentives of parties to promote their policy preferences. However, they rarely observe how the macroeconomic conditions in which parties are called to act can play a role in this process too. To fill this gap, this paper investigates how the economic performance of a country affects the policymaking process and the party-policy linkage. More specifically, this study focuses on economic crises to test whether parties are still able to fulfil their election promises even during an economic downturn. I argue that the interaction between policymaking and economic context seems to be more multifaceted than it is often represented and cannot be restricted to the financial constraints generated by a recession. The economic recession might also open up new opportunities and give parties new incentives, not least electoral ones, to carry out their policy proposals. I investigate this topic using data on pledge fulfilment in ten European countries. This allows exploring how economic circumstances have a similar/different impact on institutionally different countries.	NA
2023	1182	PP06	Beyond the Politics-Administration Dichotomy: ‘Administratification of Politics’ in South Korea	Bureaucratic politicization has steadily increased in democracies as the demands for democratic accountability has increased (e.g., Christiansen 1997; Peters & Pierre, 2004). Meanwhile, it is argued that neoliberal reforms have strengthened the control over the bureaucracy, thus increasing its politicization. Previous studies have mainly focused on bureaucratic politicization defined as political intervention in the personnel decisions of civil service, but as Aberbach et al (1981) suggest, another dimension of bureaucratic politicization includes civil servants’ participation in political activities. In this study, we explore this dimension of bureaucratic politicization through the concept of 'administratification of politics' based on a South Korean case in which a group of former officials became members of the National Assembly. With their policy expertise and bureaucratic networks, these politicians would play a significant role in policymaking under democratization and neoliberal reform. Consequently, former bureaucrat legislators will influence policy-making and augment bureaucratic politicization. From 1948 to the present, we collected a database of National Assembly members in South Korea with profiles to reveal changes in the pattern of 'administratification of politics' over time.	NA
2023	1370	PP06	How Jurisdiction Size Affects the Politics of Land Use	This article argues that increasing the average jurisdiction size of local governments reduce their incentive to permit new housing, as it attenuates inter-jurisdictional competition for high-wage workers and lowers their exposure to local economic shocks. It explores this argument by studying the effects of a reform that dramatically increased the jurisdictional size of some Danish local governments. Constructing a panel of granular data on housing permits issued by these local governments, I identify the effect of this reform using a set of difference-in-difference models. I find that in areas where jurisdiction size increased local governments issued markedly fewer permits for market rate housing, especially in municipalities which experienced a large decrease in inter-jurisdictional competition and tax-base-volatility. These findings should give pause to anyone who hopes to ameliorate the affordability crisis by centralising power over land use policy.	NA
2023	2037	2037	Explaining corporate engagement with international standard setters: the effects of corporate supply chain management and preferences on regulation	This paper seeks to shed light on the roles of corporate organisational structure and regulatory preferences in shaping corporations’ interactions with international organisations. Focusing on two major pillars of private regulation, international standards setting and public-private initiatives, we argue that companies that are in favour of more public regulation as well as those that actively manage their supply chains engage more with international private standard setting bodies. We find empirical support for these expectations. Moreover, our results show that both factors reinforce each other. This enables us to discriminate empirically between two competing rationales for corporate engagement with private standard setters: regulation seeking, and the pre-emption of costly public regulation. Our findings lend support to the former: firms engage with private standard setters for the same reasons that they favour regulation more generally.	NA
2023	902	PP06	Does Suffrage Increase Representation? Voting Age Reforms and the Recruitment of Young Politicians	Do voting age reforms increase the political representation of youth? Drawing on survey and observational data from the 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015 local elections in Norway, we test whether – and how – youth enfranchisement has had an impact on the recruitment of young politicians. In the two latter elections, 20 municipalities participated in a trial in which the voting age was lowered to 16 years. We employ a difference-in-differences design to assess how the reform affected party and voter behavior. The findings suggest that parties did not select or prioritize more young candidates in trial municipalities. However, voters gave young candidates significantly higher shares of preference votes and elected them at higher rates in the trial municipalities. The article contributes to the literature on political selection and provides evidence that enfranchisement not only increases groups’ voting participation but may as well increase their political representation.

2023	1321	PP09	Ideological Distance and Regulatory Complexity: Theory and Evidence from the US Federal Bureaucracy	We study the political determinants of regulatory complexity. We propose a simple theoretical framework that predicts that when a bureaucratic agency is ideologically apart from its political principal, unnecessarily complex regulation increases. We test this prediction in the context of the US federal bureaucracy, applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to an original dataset of more than 70,000 rules issued by 122 federal agencies from 2000 to 2022. Using a two-way fixed effects estimator, we find that the ideological distance between the President and the federal agency increases regulatory complexity, measured as the share of contingent statements in the rules. In line with the theory, this effect is driven by non-independent agencies, which are more subject to political oversight.	NA
2023	1498	PP08	Benefits by luck: A study of lotteries as a selection method for government programs	Randomization is often hailed as a fair and useful procedure to distribute government benefits in contexts of oversubscription, with the added benefit of allowing assessments of the impact of government programs. However, little is known about whether those affected by randomization also perceive it as a legitimate. Employing a three-pronged multi-method approach, we show that program beneficiaries and the general public do not share the scholars’ enthusiasm for random assignment. Our quasi-experimental analysis of 3,000 applicants for social housing lotteries in Brazil reveals tepid support for randomization, and this support is higher among winners than among non-winners. In-depth interviews suggest that applicants believe lotteries miss the 'most deserving'' beneficiaries. Finally, our general population survey experiment corroborates that lotteries are not perceived as fair or efficient when compared to other methods. While an ethically desirable and useful method for selecting beneficiaries, randomization fails to legitimatize government programs.	NA
2023	315	PP01	Targeting vaccine information framing: a randomized trial	Does the framing of vaccine information interact with recipients’ educational and immigration backgrounds? We randomize an informational intervention on 7616 mothers of girls and boys due to receive the HPV vaccine in Sweden in 2021. Mothers are stratified by education level and immigration background. We send a written leaflet covering vaccine safety and the consequences of catching HPV-induced cancers. It emphasizes sterility and invasive medical procedures, which are concerns leveraged by disinformation. The leaflet is framed emotionally, through the testimonies of local cancer survivors, or scientifically, using medical and statistical terminology. We add a pure placebo that only provides a reminder. Only Swedish-born mothers with compulsory schooling respond to scientific framing by increasing their vaccination uptake (+5 p.p.), but they understate their willingness to vaccinate. The effect is driven by mothers who pay attention to the leaflet and had little previous knowledge of HPV. Amongst mothers who do not pay attention, emotional framing reduces the uptake of mothers with high school education (-5 p.p.).	NA
2023	473	PP08	Politicians’ Preferences Over Public-Private Procurement and Credit-Claiming: Micro-Foundations	We study politicians’ preferences over procurement and how they can be affected by the credit claim potential of projects. A survey experiment on a sample of US elected local policymakers allows us to test how incumbents can strategically use infrastructure projects as part of electoral campaigns. We present a scenario to local policymakers in which they are asked to imagine that they are going to stand for office again after their current mandate and that a new infrastructure project has just been approved in their district. We manipulate whether the project will be delivered by private or public actors. Our contribution is twofold. First, we investigate politicians’ preferences over procurement strategies, teasing out how the credit claim potential of a project affects their likelihood of mentioning it as part of their campaign (past literature focuses on citizens’ preferences). Second, our empirical strategy allows us to disentangle politicians’ preferences over procurement and their expectations about the likelihood of success of the project (we observe how they manage potential tension between private interest in re-election and public interest in a successful project).

2023	110	PC07	The Representation of Gender-Related Issues in Politicians’ Discourse Over Social Media	Although women’s presence in parliament has significantly grown worldwide, women still constitute the largest underrepresented social group in the political arena. Some explain this by pointing at national-level cultural and institutional factors. Others emphasize the role parties’ characteristics play in facilitating women’s representation. Specifically, scholars contend that candidate selection methods affect female representation. Such work usually refers to the descriptive dimension of women’s representation. However, representing women is also the extent to which women-related issues are addressed. This paper examines whether the type of intra-party candidate selection method affects the amount of discourse party members (whether men or women) dedicate to women-related issues. We explore whether the candidate selection method not only affects the descriptive representation of women but improves their substantive representation. Using a computational method, we analyze a dataset comprising all national-level aspiring politicians’ Facebook posts during four election campaigns of the Israeli Parliament. Our analysis indicates an overall gap in issue attention between different selection methods. Results show that a more inclusive (rather than exclusive) method is correlated with greater women’s substantive representation.	NA
2023	1276	PL18	Shifting focus? How MP's side jobs influence the content of parliamentary questions	It is controversial whether MP’s side jobs can create conflicts of interest or even corruption. This leads to the question of the overall legitimacy of side jobs. While parliamentary behavior and policy priorities enjoy considerable attention in political science, the influence of side jobs on these subjects is underresearched. We aim to address this research gap by providing sociological and rational explanations on how side jobs can intrinsically and extrinsically influence the motivation to prioritize specific issues. In our analysis, we focus on the content of all written parliamentary questions asked in the German Bundestag (2013-2021). By employing a difference-in-difference design, we investigate how changes in MPs' side jobs lead to changes in the focus of the parliamentary questions they ask. The results have both societal and scientifically relevant implications. First, they contribute to the debate on the effect of side jobs on parliamentary behavior. Second, in analyses of legislative behavior, it is important to consider the extent to which side jobs represent an alternative to existing theoretical models and how they might confound other explanatory variables.

2023	1971	PL18	Focused debate or party-political theater? Assessing the policy focus of plenary debates in European parliaments	Parliaments are often criticized for being mere party-political theaters rather than fora for substantial debate about the pros and cons of specific policies. But to what extent does this hold true? When do MPs provide policy-focused arguments and when do MPs resort to general grandstanding which goes beyond the policy focus of the bill? In this paper we theorize various incentives regarding MP (i.e., party affiliation, within-party rank) and bill-debate characteristics (i.e., topic, bill type, procedural stage) to speak 'on topic' in bill debates. We test our expectations with a new data set - ParlLawSpeech - that offers linked full-text vectors of parliamentary speeches and the bills and laws that parliaments decide on. This allows us to measure policy-focus of partisan speech along word-vector models as the semantic similarity of bills on the plenary agenda and corresponding individual MP speeches. Our findings will provide a novel perspective on the dynamics in parliamentary democracies and shed light on the ability of legislative chambers to provide rational debate about the pros- and cons of specific policy choices.

2023	622	PL18	Does Descriptive Representation Matter? A Comparison of Young and Old MPs’ Speeches in the German Bundestag	In recent debates about political representation descriptive representation has gained more and more attention. The fact that many parliaments are not a good mirror of society has sparked public and scientific discussion about the underrepresentation of certain groups. But how strong is the effect of descriptive representation on substantive representation? Research results so far are mixed. In this paper, we focus on young people, a historically underrepresented group characterized by distinct interests and preferences. With a novel data set of topics and positions taken by MPs in more than 72,000 speeches given in 23 years of plenary debates in the German Bundestag, we examine how young MPs' speeches differ in terms of topics and ideological position. We find significant differences in the salience young and old MPs devote to certain topics. Positional differences, on the other hand, can be solely explained by party ideology. These results suggest that descriptive representation matters in particular for the issues discussed in parliament. Yet, once these issues are on the table, MPs tend to follow the party line, irrespective of their group membership.	NA
2023	658	PL18	Present from the beginning? Examining legislative speech-making in the early part of equal franchise	There is a vast literature on legislative speech-making by women. Most of these studies focus on modern parliamentary settings. In this paper we focus on whether patterns of legislative speech-making by women are established from the outset when the franchise is extended to women or whether it develops over time. We explore this question by focusing on Denmark 1918-1939. Women were first elected to the upper and lower chambers of the Danish Parliament in 1918. Legislation had to pass both chambers allowing us to use the variation in whether women speak on a topic in just one of the chambers, in both chambers or does not speak at all on the topic. We analyse the question by examining the number and content of speeches. We also use debate records to conduct a quantitative text analysis of speech-making. Our findings suggest that the patterns of legislative speech-making by women takes time to develop and that the differences found might be partisan instead of exclusively gendered.	NA

2023	258	IP15	Closing Shop: Informal Governance and Openness to Transnational Actors in World Politics	In recent years, international organizations with lower degrees of institutionalization and formalization, or informal intergovernmental organizations (IIGOs), have grown. IIGOs are believed to be primarily interstate talk shops which are beneficial because they are ‘low-cost’ institutions and better able to secure information and confidentiality. Accordingly, we might expect IIGOs to share a key feature: the exclusion of transnational actors (TNAs). Yet, a cursory look at IIGOs reveals that they vary in the extent to which they provide opportunities for the participation of TNAs. This paper examines this variation, asking: under what circumstances are IIGOs likely to be closed to TNAs? Theoretically, it posits that the political costs of inclusion, TNA resources, and the institutional environment affect whether IIGO are open or closed to TNAs. Empirically, we present new data on TNA access to 94 IIGOs and examine the variation in IIGO openness. We also illustrate how political costs, TNA resources, and the institutional environment affected the Australia Group’s inclusion of TNAs. Our findings have implications for debates on the rise of informal institutions and the openness of global governance.	NA
2023	259	IP15	Understanding Resourcing Trade-offs in International Organizations: Evidence from an Elite Survey Experiment	International Organizations (IOs) are asked to address some of the most important global challenges under intense budget scarcity. In recent years, they expanded their funding base through a greater reliance on voluntary earmarked contributions by member states and non-state actors. Critics warn that earmarked funding undermines the autonomy of IOs and the quality of their operations. This creates an important trade-off: IOs can do more with earmarked funding, but have less control over what they do and do it less well. We theorize that how IO decision-makers resolve this trade-off depends on how their motivations are conceptualized. Depending on the theoretical perspective employed, IO staff can be seen as primarily responsible, obedient, slacking, or pathological. We then test these hypotheses through a novel elite survey experiment with staff from 6 UN organizations (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA). Our study provides important insights for emerging debates on the resourcing of IOs and broader study of the motivations of international bureaucrats.	NA
2023	260	IP15	Exploring the role of leadership in IOs during crises: A new research agenda	International organizations (IOs) ordinarily face pressures to upkeep performance, ensure output addresses input, secure members’ support, navigate gridlock and fragmentation, and guard centrality. Crises may exacerbate pressures, potentially affecting functions, performance, and legitimacy, and even result in outright dissolution. While some IOs cope well with crises, others seem to struggle. This paper aims to explain that variation by inductively mapping out an analytical framework on the role of leading institutional actors during crises, opening new avenues for IO research. Relying primarily on over 50 interviews with IO officials, state representatives, and experts, the paper’s case studies apply its leadership framework to the crisis-response processes of three IOs: 1) the World Trade Organization's handling of the Appellate Body crisis, 2) the World Bank's strategies for navigating the rise of alternative development institutions, 3) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's adaptation to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The findings highlight the often-neglected role of institutional leaders in handling challenges, their reliance on limited but crucial institutional tools, resources, and competences, as well as the specific context of the crisis they navigate.

2023	1236	PP05	Why Are Some Public Servants More Professional Than Others? The Influence of Personality Traits on Bureaucratic Attitudes and Norms	Why are some public servants more professional than others? To answer this question, I focus on the interactions between citizens and bureaucrats grounded in psychology and political economy. In nexus with these perspectives, I aim to study how personality traits influence bureaucratic professionalism and how these traits interact with institutional and cultural legacies. Further, I propose that personality traits will matter differently in different institutional contexts. For instance, we can agree that narcissistic personalities will be more prone to corruption — but only some institutional settings will encourage narcissistic personalities to engage in corrupt activities. This research project, therefore, aims to deepen the understanding of how the specifics of cultural and developmental contexts influence professional behaviour. I intend to employ an experiment fielded in Italy using measures of personality traits, including the Big-Five Model and the Dark Triad of Personality: to evaluate the interaction between institutional environments and personality traits, and in turn, its influence on bureaucratic professionalism.

2023	1735	PP05	Introducing a typology of representative bureaucracy profiles in Europe	The field of representative bureaucracy is concerned with the social groups that have access to the public administration and how more (less) representative civil service configurations affect policymaking content and dynamics. While the field is heavily developed in the U.S., several recent literature reviews have shown the scarcity of empirical work in other settings, and particularly, the lack of cross-country comparative studies. This article uses the multidimensional Index of Bureaucratic Underrepresentation to show time-series patterns on the historically disadvantaged groups that are most (least) excluded from public administrations in 36 European countries. The index covers five dimensions: gender, ethnicity, nationality, age and disability. The article proposes a typology to characterize the different clusters of countries and develops grounded theory to explain the stark contrasts found in terms of level and types of exclusions. The theory highlights inertial aspects related to administrative traditions (Painter and Peters 2010), as well as more contingent aspects associated to the idea of Public Service Bargains (Hood and Lodge 2006). The findings aim to contribute to an under-researched field of political science and invite discussion on	NA
2023	1809	PP05	Collaborative cheating in the public sector: A behavioral experiment with civil servants in the UK	This paper provides experimental evidence regarding two challenges in the current study of honesty in the public sector. First, identifying the causal effect of public sector culture on honest behavior; and the lack of behavioral evidence on the honesty of public sector workers in the context of collaboration. To address the first challenge we take advantage of the relationship between culture and identity and the possibility of selectively prime identity (Cohn et al., 2014). We utilize a novel instrument for priming public sector identity (Sulitzeanu-Kenan et al. 2022) in a pre-registered randomized experiment involving civil servants in the UK (N=1000). To address the second challenge we programmed in oTree (Chen et al., 2016) an interactive online version of the collaborative dice-rolling task (Weisel & Shalvi, 2015), and used it to measure collaborative dishonest behavior.

2023	184	PP05	Politicization, Personality Traits, and the Performance of Public Administrators	Recent years have seen increasing politicization of the United States civil service, and decreasing morale among employees as well. Previous research has highlighted the relationships between agency politicization and turnover (as well as other career outcomes), yet—with the notable exceptions of ideology and public service motivation—no large-scale study has examined how individual differences affect the relationship between the politicization of individual bureaucrats’ work environments and their career decisions, broadly speaking. Here, using a new survey of almost 2000 U.S. federal employees, we examine how individual traits (e.g., personality, authoritarianism, economic preferences over time and money, ideology, public service motivation, etc.) affect the relationship between agency politicization and individual morale, job satisfaction, and other outcome variables of interest. Our results show that these traits affect the extent to which structural political variables affect career outcomes, and are also influential in and of themselves. Results are instructive for both practitioners as well as scholars of bureaucratic politics, political psychology, and public administration.	NA
2023	696	PP05	Meritocracy and Politicization in a Weberian bureaucracy: Does insulation work? Leveraging big data from Spain	The selection model and career incentives of public administrators matters greatly for the performance of a bureaucracy. It affects the quality-of-service provision, the magnitude of waste, and the capacity to innovate. In this paper we leverage massive micro-level administrative data to illuminate key questions about the degree of meritocracy and politicization in the selection and career advancement of civil servants. Focusing on the higher bodies of the Spanish bureaucracy, we have extracted massive data from the Spanish Official State Bulletin to trace the career trajectories of all civil servants from four elite bureaucratic corps. These comprehensive data allow us to analyze the successes and limitations of Weberian selection systems, the mechanisms of the politicization of the civil service, and the progress and obstacles to the diversification of bureaucracies (particularly with regards to gender, disability, and class). In so doing, the paper will contribute to policy and societal debates about the civil service, its representativeness, and its autonomy from the political sphere.	NA
2023	1439	EU14	Rally around the Rule of Law? How does European Union (in)action affect public opinion in backsliding member states?	How does international organizations' enforcement (or lack thereof) of democracy and rule-of-law standards influence domestic responses to backsliding governments? On the one hand, international relations scholars have argued that international enforcement actions provide normative focal points for the mobilization of domestic compliance constituencies and bestow legitimacy on actors with international law on their side. On the other hand, both scholars and practitioners worry that international enforcement action may create ``rally-around-the-flag' effects that inadvertently increase support for backsliding regimes. We present the pre-analysis plan for a survey experiment designed to assess the likely effect of European Union (EU) action -- or inaction -- in response to rule-of-law backsliding in Poland -- the largest of the EU member states experiencing a serious decline in the rule of law.

2023	35	EU14	Nationalist Claims In An Era of Anti-Globalist Conservatism in Europe	Viktor Orbán, the autocratic leader of Hungary, urges nationalists in Europe to “unite our forces” against progressives and globalists. He also claims that most European countries can no longer be called “nations”, since they adopt multiculturalism and “mixed race” practices. Similar arguments are made by illiberal nationalist politicians across Europe. Starting from the position that nationhood is not an ethnodemographic fact but a political claim – to people’s loyalty and their solidarity – I will examine some different ways in which the claim to nationhood bolsters the agenda of far-right conservatives in a range of European settings. What do contemporary nationalists in Europe mean when they claim to speak in the name of the nation? What is the purpose of promoting a state that is of and for a putative nation? What do the differences and similarities in the nationalist idiom across Europe tell us about nationalism and its role in contemporary politics? I will address these normative questions in the context of contemporary practice in Europe, primarily in Hungary, Italy and Sweden.	NA
2023	38	EU14	Just To Be Clear? European Parliament Position-Taking and Public Opinion	The European Parliament has a treaty mandate to represent EU citizens. However, we know little about how the EP reacts to public opinion during the legislative process. We analyze whether and when citizens’ opinion affects the clarity of EP legislative positions. We argue that when public opinion on EU policy integration across the EU member states is divided, the EP will draw less concrete amendments. In contrast, when the views of EU citizens are unified, the EP will use more concrete language. Hence, it strikes a balance between acting as a competent legislature with a strong position in inter-institutional bargaining in the face of united public opinion and avoiding an image of being disconnected from EU citizens given a divided public. Such strategic position-taking is more likely on legislative proposals with higher integration potential and public salience. We measure the ambiguity of the EPs’ policy positions formulated in 2009-2019 using dictionary-based content analysis and draw on the Eurobarometer indicators to capture public opinion. This paper contributes to the study of law-making and democratic deficit in the EU.	NA
2023	643	EU14	Pioneers of Socialization: Building Bridges through European Cultural Projects	Since the beginning of the 1990s, the European Union exerts soft power in the cultural policy area with funding cooperation projects conducted by private cultural actors. However, existing research lacks comprehensive assessment on the individual level whether the Commission is successful with its engagement. The core goal is to foster future cooperation among European people of various cultural sectors under a common framework. In theoretical manners, this process is related to identity formation, socialization and transnational cooperation. Apart from the cultural operators’ individual motivations to participate in the European funding programs and set up cooperation with foreign partners, the long-term sustainability of the Union’s policy engagement is targeted. The analysis follows a mixed-methods design combining semi-structured interviews with systematic coding of the arguments and their quantitative analysis. The interviews differentiate between three groups of cultural operators: People registered in European cultural platforms, which indicates their general interest to engage in European-wide processes (1), people explicitly looking for project partners to apply for funding (2) and people who are already conducting a project or complete one soon (3).

2023	1486	IP10	Gains, Losses, and Public Support for International Cooperation: Evidence from Framing Experiments in Three Countries	Although states usually agree to cooperate internationally when the benefits of such cooperation exceed the costs, these costs can still be substantial. How can governments intent on signing such agreements convince the public that these costs are worth bearing? To examine this question, we examine how framing the consequences of cooperation and the consequences of not cooperating affects public attitudes. In light of well-known biases in people’s decision-making, we argue that framing cooperation as a potential gain, or its absence as a potential loss, influences voters’ willingness to embrace international cooperation. We analyze two pre-registered survey experiments, fielded in three countries, concerning different international negotiations. Contrary to expectations about people’s loss aversion, our results show that framing the lack of cooperation as a loss substantially reduces support among opponents of the agreement, whereas highlighting potential gains increases overall support. These findings have broader implications for our understanding of the (lack of) persuasiveness of elite endorsements, especially with regard to the backlash to “project fear” campaigns, and carry important practical advice for advocates of international cooperation.

2023	1525	IP03	With a little help from my friends? Keeping voting rights in the United Nations General Assembly	Member states of the United Nations may lose their voting rights due to the non-payment of dues, which according to Coggins and Morse (2022) is the cause for a large share of the absences in roll called votes. While the rules for losing the voting rights are quite clear, namely having failed to pay in full the dues for two consecutive years, not all laggards/defaulters lose their voting rights, as the Committee on Contributions has some leeway in proposing which member states should lose these right (a decision, ultimately made by the United Nations General Assembly itself). Drawing on a complete set of decisions on voting rights withdrawals, it can be shown that these decisions are not free from political influence. These initial results suggest that withdrawls of voting rights need to be studied in more detail and their political nature being taken into account when analyzing voting records, particularly absences.

2023	531	IP10	Glocal Governance: The Effect of COP meetings on Local Environmental Attitudes	International relations scholarship has studied how international organizations (IOs) affect actors beyond states, including the public. I contribute to this body of research and focus on an overlooked way IOs can affect the general public: by influencing attitudes of people who live in a close proximity to the specific place and time of their institutional meetings. International meetings increase salience of the discussed issue in the local community that hosts them by organising events, by engaging with local political authorities, and by attracting initiatives from other interested social actors: non-governmental organisations, media sources, and protestors. I test this argument by analyzing the Conference of the Parties’ (COP) effect on people’s environmental preferences in the regions they took place. I identify COP’s local effects by applying a staggered difference-in-differences design on bi-yearly waves of Eurobarometer time-series cross-sectional data (2002–2022). I corroborate this large-N evidence with a case-study of Glasgow’s COP26 meeting that illustrates the mechanism. Results show that IOs do not operate in a vacuum and that their meetings can be strategic opportunities to foster issue salience.	NA
2023	604	IP10	Race, Issues, and Public Support for International Coalitions	Does the perceived race of potential coalition partners influence US public support for coalitions themselves? Identifying the specific influence of race on coalition support is challenging because of the number of confounding variables, including the national identity and location of coalition partners, as well as partisanship in the United States. We take advantage of the broad-ranging but relatively unknown Indo-Pacific Quad coalition to examine whether White Americans are less supportive when the coalition partner presented is a majority non-White country. In a survey experiment fielded to a representative sample of approximately 3,000 Americans, we manipulated the presentation of the Quad to focus on different leaders and compared respondents’ support conditional on whether the country leader was White or non-White. We find limited evidence that in the absence of strong political cues, the race of the coalition partner affects White Americans’ support for cooperation. Partisanship is a strong driver of perceptions, however, making it challenging to assess the effect of race even in an experimental setting.	NA
2023	876	IP10	International Redistribution and Natural Disasters	Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, especially in less developed countries that lack the resources needed to recover from the economic hardship caused by extreme weather events. To alleviate this problem, industrialized democracies provide financial support in the form of international disaster assistance. Yet, these financial transfers can become politically contentious because they reduce the amount of resources available for domestic assistance programs. Moreover, the provision of disaster relief requires morally charged 'divide-the-dollar' decisions that determine how limited resources should be distributed between affected countries. We explore the structure of mass preferences over global disaster relief with a focus on fairness concerns and foreign policy interests. We evaluate our predictions using experiments fielded to representative samples of the adult populations in the United Kingdom and the United States, the two most important donor countries. We compare the relative importance of fairness and policy interests for explaining voter preferences over international disaster relief. We then compare our findings with observed disaster relief distributions implemented by OECD countries using data for 203 recipient countries from 2000 to 2014.	NA
2023	1795	IP09	Leapfrogging into the Fast Lane: The Political Economy of Outward Investment from the Global South	In the past two decades, there has been an unprecedented rise in outward investment from the Global South. Corresponding with this rise in outward investment are industrial policies, where emerging market governments use financial subsidies to incentivise their firms’ outward investments. Why are developing countries increasingly adopting policies that would shift capital outside of a capital-scarce economy? To explain this puzzle, I argue that outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) confers developmental benefits to developing economies similar to those usually fulfilled by inward FDI flows (IFDI). Developing countries that experience less success harnessing developmental benefits from IFDI are thus more likely to adopt a policy strategy of supporting OFDI. I test my theory using a mixed methods approach, combining a quantitative analysis from 84 emerging markets, as well as case studies of India and Brazil. This paper’s presents new empirical evidence demonstrating the conditions under which emerging markets use their outward investment to “leapfrog” traditional development processes. This framework highlights a new development pathway for emerging markets in the context of increased economic globalization.	NA
2023	396	IP09	Governing Market Access: Local Currency Bond Markets and the Gatekeeping Power of Indexes	A government’s ability to borrow in its own currency enhances sovereign debt sustainability and national policy autonomy. While recent research highlights that a few large emerging markets have gained regular access to local currency bond markets, many developing countries continue to have only limited ability to meet their financing needs in local currency. For example, the pre-dominant local currency bond index, JP Morgan’s GBI-EM index, has included no more than 16 developing countries since its inception in the early 2000s. Given the influence of index inclusion on market access, we probe the conditions under which JP Morgan subjectively includes and excludes developing country sovereign bonds from the GBI-EM. We hypothesize that in addition to macroeconomic fundamentals, government partisanship and policy choices dictate whether JP Morgan includes a government’s locally-denominated debts in its index. We test for this using various hazard models. The findings have implications for the international political economy of sovereign debt and finance.	NA
2023	431	IP09	Pleading poverty: Government manipulation and access to sovereign credit	How do governments convince creditors of their ability to repay debts? Creditors face an information asymmetry when assessing sovereign creditworthiness as borrowing governments know more about their own ability and willingness to repay. I argue that governments take advantage of this asymmetry to manipulate the information that creditors use to make lending decisions and negotiate repayment. When entering the sovereign bond market, requesting credit ratings, and issuing new bonds, governments have incentives to artificially inflate measures of economic prosperity to improve access to credit. However, when governments are unwilling to repay debts, they have incentives to 'plead poverty' by underestimating the resources available for repayment. Using nighttime GDP estimates, tax revenue projections, and hidden sovereign debt, I create several measures of manipulation in governments' economic and fiscal reports. I find that positive manipulation (overestimating fiscal resources) increases when governments are courting creditors, while negative manipulation (underestimating fiscal resources) increases when governments are restructuring their sovereign debt. These findings demonstrate how governments engage in financial statecraft and circumvent creditor discipline to secure advantageous credit outcomes in good times and in bad.	NA
2023	475	IP01	U.S. Support and Sovereign Debt: Crises and Consequences in International Capital Markets	Contrary to standard economic theory, states that fail to repay their debt obligations face limited financial repercussions. Why? We argue borrowing states' relationships with stronger states, particularly the United States, affect markets' perceptions of states post-default. US support repairs states' reputations faster than non-supported states. As a result, U.S.-supported states have less to fear by abandoning their debt obligations. We test our argument with a series of empirical analyses using data on debt restructuring episodes from 1975 to 2016. We find that states with stronger relationships with the United States are more likely to restructure existing debt obligations and are more likely to force large losses on investors. Yet these same states largely avoid the harsh consequences normally associated with debt restructuring. Supported states face lower borrowing costs and wait shorter periods of time to re-enter the bond market after a debt restructuring. Our argument and findings show the importance of how international factors change the incentives on how states operate in financial markets.	NA
2023	970	IP09	The World Trade Organization and Developing Countries	To exert Compulsory, Institutional, Structural, or Productive Power, ostensibly weak states may use various strategies. We focus on Productive Power and the associated strategy of “rhetorical framing”: the use of particular words or terms to characterize an issue and imply appropriate policy actions in line with that characterization. We expect rhetorical framing to be particularly important for “the weak” because it can be wielded defensively, is accessible even by very weak states, and is compatible with other strategies. To probe these expectations, we analyze negotiation transcripts from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Based on over 5,000 observations between 1995 and 2020, we confirm that rhetorical framing is 1) used to counter the strong, 2) used even by very weak states, and 3) used in conjunction with other strategies. While strong states tend to promulgate a rhetorical frame emphasizing Reciprocation (mutual concessions between states), weak states counter with an alternative rhetorical frame emphasizing Redistribution (one-way transfers from stronger states to weaker ones). Our findings make conceptual contributions, revealing how weak states’ aims and approaches differ from those of strong states.	NA
2023	1767	PP07	Automating (In)equality? The Potential Impact of Algorithmic Decision-Making	The increasing use of algorithmic predictions for decision-making in public policy settings is accompanied by concerns about their potential to embed biases and reinforce inequalities. Sparked by these concerns, a substantial body of literature has emerged on disparities in predicted values and predictive performances. The impact of algorithmic decision-making, however, does not only follow from the predictions. In this article, we show that the impact on inequality depends on the heterogeneity of effects of subsequent interventions and on the allocation rule. We illustrate our argument using data on programs for jobseekers in public employment services in Switzerland. By performing retrospective counterfactual impact evaluations with varying allocation rules, we show how algorithmic decision-making affects inequality in outcomes. To choose between different allocation rules, the policy maker must decide how averse to inequality the allocation should be. Our approach can help guide policymakers and inform the public debate on the impacts of algorithmic decision-making.	NA

An experimental study on the role of performance, accountability, and embedded public service values	Solving the legitimacy gap in the digital transformation of public services is key to efficient and reliable citizen-state relationships in Western bureaucracies. In a conjoint experiment, we therefore ask three stakeholder groups; public IT managers, frontline civil servants, and citizens; how intelligent self-service chatbots for local public service should be designed. The design of the chatbot has to account for five principles; (1) safety and privacy standards, (2) accountability (human in the loop), (3) embedded values, (4) the distribution of automatization gains (citizens vs. municipality), and (5) the type of interface. The research design enables us to identify the design features that IT experts, civil servants, and citizens consider essential for solving the legitimacy gap. In the second step, we test whether respondents’ pre-existing technology attitudes and regulation preferences moderate the relative weighting of system design features. The study’s results will contribute to developing intelligent self-service chatbots for local public services that civil servants and citizens can appreciate.	NA
2023	1870	PP07	Digitalisation and Socioeconomic Issues in German Parliamentary Debates before and after the Covid-19 Pandemic: From Horseman of the Apocalypse to White Knight?	Many experts and laypeople believe that digitalisation will furter increase socioeconomic inequality. The pandemic seems to have accelerated those fears. So far, we know less what politicians think and say about this, and whether such fears may have an impact on legislative dynamics. We look at German parliamentary debates before and after the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany to see whether indeed the pandemic was a watershed moment in the way the parliament invokes discussions on digitalization. Methodologically we extract important socioeconomic themes and policy fields discussed in parliamentary debates, using a topic model approach. We test whether there are visible differences between before and after the start of the covid-19 pandemic both in the salience of these themes, and in the sentiment with which parliamentarians talk about them. We find that indeed, the German parliamentary debates on digitalisation evolved, somewhat moving away from their pre-covid focus on digitalisation as mainly an issue for modernizing the economy, infrastructure or data protection, towards – at least temporarily – more concerns regarding education, the health sector, as well as social and labour policy.

2023	863	PP07	Policymaking on AI: Comparing three policy domains in the USA, Germany, France, and Switzerland	Scholars and practitioners agree that the public regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) is a major challenge that affects different policy domains. Up to now, we know little about how policymakers (public administrations, elected officials, parties and interest groups) politicize AI in the policy process. This paper therefore analyzes which actors are considered most influential regarding the politicization of AI. Moreover, it explores whether collaborations between actors involved in AI policymaking occur within or across policy venues (e.g., executive, parliamentary and judiciary arenas). The paper is based on original, comparative survey data that cover AI from the perspective of organizational actors in Banking and Finance, Health, and Social Welfare, in France, Germany, Switzerland and the USA. The data set allows us to assess how AI is politicized by actors embedded in different venues nested in various political systems and to uncover how policymaking on AI might go beyond policymaking in individual policy domains on the national level. This way, we can shed light on both horizontally and vertically connected nature of policymaking on new and complex issues such as AI.	NA
2023	1087	M07	No more cost in translation: Validating open-source machine translation for quantitative text analysis	As more and more scholars apply text-as-data methods to multilingual corpora, machine translation has become an indispensable tool to overcome language barriers in such applications. Yet, while machine translation has been successfully validated for different political text analysis tasks, relying on commercial services, such as Google Translate or DeepL, limits reproducibility and can be financially taxing. This paper assesses the viability of a reproducible and affordable alternative: publicly available open-source machine translation models. We ask whether machine translation with open-source models instead of commercial services yields substantially different measurements. We address this question by replicating published studies that have evaluated the machine translation approach for different analytical tasks: cross-lingual topic modeling, dictionary analysis, and supervised text classification. We find only minor differences between the measurements obtained from corpora translated with open-source models and commercial services. We conclude that “free” machine translation is a very valuable addition to researchers’ multilingual text analysis toolkit. Our study adds to a growing body of work on multilingual text analysis methods and has direct practical implications for applied researchers.	NA
2023	1654	M07	Melting Snowflakes? Evaluating the loss of linguistic uniqueness from machine translation for unsupervised scaling models in comparative perspective	Multilingual data challenges comparativepolitical research. Although scholars have come up with multiple approaches for addressing these limits, the extent of the problem has yet to be fully established. We argue that there remains information loss due to common automated translation processes and that this systematically varies by the target translation language. To evaluate this argument, we measure the amount of information loss inherent to common translation approaches by comparing analysis of benchmark speaker positions estimated from unsupervised and weakly supervised scaling models in a comparative perspective. We utilize data from eight countries including five languages which are part of the ParlEE dataset. This data allows us to precisely estimate the information loss caused by the difference in linguistic families and account for the information loss compared to a monolingual, untranslated analysis for estimating policy positions.The results from this analysis hold implications for understanding the biases introduced by automated translations and therefore the limits for hypothesis testing in a comparative framework.

2023	1778	1778	Detecting Online Hate Speech: Comparison of Annotation Approaches and Their Impact on Classifier Performance	Efforts to study and curb online hate speech depend on capacity to detect it at scale. A critical step in state-of-the-art classification pipelines remains the production of a large number of high-quality annotations to train classifiers. While machine-learning methods assume the availability of adequate labeled data, the step is usually poorly documented. Consequently, there is little guidance available to construct a training set effectively and efficiently. The goal of this paper is to contrast different approaches as well as their performance, using a unique corpus of online comments developed in the context of a project on detecting and countering online hate speech in Switzerland. First, we compare how online comments were labeled, following identical instructions, by coders belonging to different groups: research assistants, activists, crowd workers, and citizen scientists. Second, we analyze differences in the performance of classifiers based on which sets of annotations were used to train them. The results illustrate the challenge and importance of constructing a high-quality training set, and provide direction for various kinds of difficult classification tasks, including (but not limited to) online hate speech.

2023	1453	PL08	Capturing Political Capital: The relationship between candidate appearance on MPs' social media and party leader election outcomes.	Party leader candidates feature prominently on social media. As potential figureheads of their party, they are often depicted by party members. While the literature extensively covers the selection processes and the democratization of these elections, actual appearance of candidates in images is still under-explored. This paper seeks to fill this gap by arguing that candidates' social media appearance is an indicator of internal political capital by providing analyses of 51560 Instagram images posted by Canadian, German and British MPs during 14 party leader elections between 2019 and 2022. Methodologically, we utilise a face recognition classifier that measures how often party leaders are depicted on MPs’ social media. This allows us to present a novel comparative large-N analysis that provides insight into parliamentarians' social media. We hypothesize that party leader appearance is driven by intra-party support rather than general public support. Our results contribute to literature on political capital in general, and on the relationship between internal and external political capital specifically.	NA
2023	1696	PL08	Keep Your Enemies Closer: How Do Leaders Redistribute Partisan Goods?	In parliament, legislative leaders shape the fate of their party. Externally, they shape the negotiations with other parties. Internally, they structure the daily partisan activity by coordinating individual MPs. Coordination is eased by the leader's control over partisan resources. Their optimal use implies redistribution and delegation. This paper formerly and empirically investigates how leaders distribute partisan resources among their MPs. Specifically, leaders face a trade-off. They can favor ideologically close MPs and reduce moral hazards. But they can also ensure the loyalty of powerful MPs and prevent their costly defection. Using game theory and an innovative game setting, I demonstrate that the leaders’ optimal redistribution strategy depends on the intra-partisan distribution of both ideological positions and power. Most of the time, the leader can enforce the party line and reduce power inequalities. Problems arise in presence of powerful extremists, who force the leader to choose between empowering extremists, hence increasing inequalities, or facing the costly rebellion of the extremist. These power inequalities eventually translate into representation inequalities, which have broad implications for the literature on representation and policy-making.	NA
2023	355	PL08	Political Leader Selection: A Theory and Empirical Evidence	We examine the selection of political leaders within parties. Focusing on MPs' individual decision-making in an intraparty leadership competition, our theoretical framework predicts that re-election and reward motives explain MPs' heterogeneous support for candidates. Exploiting Germany's personalized voting system, new data on local opinion polls, and a fierce intraparty competition before the 2021 German general election, we provide empirical support for the theoretical predictions. Empirical work faces the challenge that MPs' individual choices between candidates are typically not revealed during a selection 'behind closed doors''. We overcome this challenge by exploiting a leak of party-internal data that allows us to observe MPs’ individual choices. MPs were more likely to support the more popular opponent when local opinion polls predicted them to be at higher risk to lose the personalized vote in their constituency. In contrast, MPs were more likely to support the incumbent when their expected reward was high. We investigate for the first time how local opinion polls at the constituency-level influence MPs' behavior.	NA
2023	754	PL02	Thinking, Speaking, Doing? Preference, Speech and Floor Voting Congruence	Parliamentary speeches and votes are key aspects of democratic representation, yet given potential party constraints, MPs may not accurately express their sincere preferences. This raises two key questions: To what extent do MPs express their true preferences when giving speeches in parliament? And to what extent does their subsequent voting behaviour reflect their true and expressed preferences? These questions remain understudied, and in particular, the relationship between true and expressed preferences is unexplored. We analyse a novel dataset covering four terms (2002-2018) of the Swedish Riksdag, combining four surveys with response rates of over 90%, all final votes on legislation, and the speeches given on legislation. We show the extent to which MPs are constrained by their parties in terms of expressing their preferences in debates and as well as in floor voting. We also assess the extent to which personal votes influence behaviour in the Riksdag. By comparing true and expressed preferences we are better suited than previous studies to capture the open and covert ideological differences within parties, thus advancing ongoing research on intraparty dynamics in party-centred legislatures.

2023	1046	IP08	The Dog That Stopped Barking: The Domestic Politics of Multinational Corporations in the New Phase of Globalization	Rising economic nationalist policies – vide Brexit, the US attacks on Chinese exports, India’s return to import substitution industrialization – are occurring when multinational corporations (MNCs), who stand to lose the most from the fraying of the neoliberal economic order, are at the zenith of their economic and political power. Why? I hypothesize that the 'disembeddedness' of international capital from domestic politics may explain the rise of economic nationalism. By 'disembeddedness', I refer to the degree of production activity ties that firms have to a given economy. As MNCs have grown disembedded from the domestic economic policy of states, the relative bargaining power of domestic import-competing firms vis-à-vis MNCs has increased, thereby fundamentally reversing the domestic political dynamics of MNCs over the last four decades. To test this argument, I draw from an original firm-level dataset that identifies the degree of ‘disembeddedness’ and the lobbying activity of MNCs in the aftermath of the UK’s referendum on membership in the European Union (EU).

2023	1733	1733	The Determinants of FDI Inflows: Evidence From Firm and Municipality-Level Data From Brazil	Do local politics affect multinational corporations’ (MNCs) decisions on where to invest? Previous research has shown that MNCs’ location decisions are shaped by host country characteristics like regime type, political stability, and partisan cycles of the national government. However, little is known about the influence of local governments in such investment decisions. This is an important topic because local governments are often directly involved with foreign investment attraction: they set up investment attraction offices, organize business missions to foreign countries, and have the legal authority to decide on the allocation of incentives and subsidies. In many countries, local authorities even engage in disputes against each other to attract a given MNC, leading to major fiscal wars. Using data on effective FDI transactions to Brazil at the firm and host municipality levels between 2011 and 2021, this paper examines whether partisanship and partisan alignment at the local, state, and national levels affect cities’ ability to attract FDI.

2023	1864	PE20	Collective Irresponsibility: Corporate Lobbying under Consumer and Investor Scrutiny	When companies lobby governments, they have a choice between two strategies. They can conduct so-called “inside” lobbying by directly contacting decision-makers. They can also influence public opinion - so-called “outside lobbying.” This paper shows an unexplored tension between inside lobbying and public opinion. Information on inside lobbying that reaches the public changes the public’s opinion of interest groups themselves. Inside lobbying that is misaligned with public preferences thus creates a reputational cost. As investors and consumers increasingly care about “corporate social responsibility,” companies need to be careful to preserve their reputations as good political citizens. I use two original survey experiments on climate lobbying to show that corporate lobbying affects companies’ reputations with consumers and investors. I also demonstrate that companies can preserve their public image by shifting their unpopular lobbying positions into business associations, a strategy which I call “collective irresponsibility.” I then use lobbying data from the European Union and a newly collected dataset of companies’ membership in business associations to test whether companies do shift unpopular lobbying into associations when they face pressure from consumers and investors.

2023	2001	IP08	Multinational firms and the impact of trade disputes on investment decisions	The rise of global value chains (GVCs) is reshaping the political economy of trade in several ways, including the politics of trade disputes. Trade disputes affect access to markets and suppliers in ways that are likely to influence investment decisions. Indeed, recent work examines how multinationals influence the initiation and duration of disputes. Yet we know little about how multinationals respond to trade frictions in a world of GVCs. We argue that trade disputes can actually lead to greater inward FDI in respondent countries because a (resolved) trade dispute signals lower barriers to trade. This hurts domestic producers in the respondent and creates opportunities for multinationals in the complainant country. However, we expect that the effect of trade disputes will depend on how and to what extent the industry integrates into GVCs. In particular, we expect the impact of a dispute to be greater where there are more backward linkages, that is, in industries that rely on imported inputs. We use data on dyad-industry level greenfield FDI from FDI markets between 2003 and 2015 to test our hypotheses.	NA
2023	829	IP08	Transparency Shocks and Private Governance in Offshore Finance	Secrecy and anonymity are hallmarks of offshore finance, yet activists and civil society have sought to combat secrecy through information provision. How do transnational information shocks affect the governance of offshore finance? While major leaks like the 2016 Panama Papers and 2021 Pandora Papers did not lead to major public policy changes, they may have led to changes in the private governance behaviour of firms through their internal operations. To assess such effects, and the potential mechanisms behind them, we seek to evaluate the impact of these leaks on firms’ recruiting of due diligence and anti-money laundering (AML) personnel. We measure recruitment using data from LightCast on the near universe of online job postings in the United States and United Kingdom beginning in 2012, and searching for AML-related keywords. We compare AML hiring before and after each leak, for firms with varying degrees of implication and exposure from the leaks and their fallout, and compare these against “placebo” recruitment fields. We further test mechanisms by investigating treatment effect heterogeneity for firms with varying exposure to public enforcement and corruption risks.	NA
2023	1304	IP07	Inequality, climate, and commerce: how trade liberalization conditions climate-disasters' impact on local inequality	This paper studies the effect of climate-change related extreme weather events on local levels of inequality, conditional on the degree of trade liberalization in a given locality. I exploit Brazil's 1990s trade liberalization episode as a source of an exogenous shock to local communities which induced worsening levels of local inequality. The resulting increase in inequality leaves local communities more exposed to the devastating effects from climate-change related disasters in later years, resulting in variegated effects conditional on the degree of trade-liberalization in the recent past. I show, in particular, that trade's disproportionate impact on low-skilled industries increases exposure to and reduces the ability to recover from climate-related events for poorer segments of communities who are often employed by impacted industries.I test these effects utilizing a common method for determining local levels of exposure to trade liberalization in Brazil combined with census microdata and a novel dataset geolocating climate-related extreme weather events.

2023	1443	IP07	The Determinants of Retaliation in International Economic Conflict	The primary goal of economic sanctions is to coerce the target (the sanctioned country) into a policy change. Although targets frequently adopt economic countersanctions, we know little about what determines a target’s decision to retaliate. This article argues that while materially rich senders (sanctioning countries) can rely on their economic might to deter retaliation, relatively weak senders leverage the support of IOs to avoid countermeasures. I test the theory with a mixed methods approach. A two-way fixed effects model and an instrumental variable approach accounting for the potential endogeneity of IO support test the four arguments quantitatively. Two case studies verify the hypothesized mechanisms in the context of international environmental politics. The findings indicate that the hypothesized determinants have large effects on the likelihood of retaliation in a broad range of contexts and that the hypothesized mechanisms are observable in the two case studies. Especially the finding that IOs disproportionally benefit relatively weak senders has important implications, including for future international environmental policies aiming to achieve cooperation through the threat of economic sanctions.

2023	1446	IP07	Governments' Strategic Role in Information-Producing International Organizations	A core function of international organisations (IOs) is to provide information to address international cooperation problems. Despite convincing evidence for the importance of information and the conditions under which information facilitates cooperative outcomes, we know little about governments' strategic role in shaping the information that IOs provide. Existing research is largely agnostic about the information production process. In this paper, we develop a theoretical argument that models governments' incentives to intervene in an IO's information production process. For cases when such information will be relevant for shaping negotiation outcomes, we specify at what points along the information production and negotiation cycle governments will exercise their influence. Empirically, we draw on text data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nation's scientific body on climate change, to find strong support for our argument: for topics in IPCC scientific assessments that governments expect to matter greatly in UN climate negotiations, governments strategically interfere already at the information production stage. These findings have major implications for our understanding of the role of information in IOs and international cooperation more broadly.	NA
2023	1734	IP07	Climate agreements fail to sufficiently reduce emissions: Evidence from a climate game	Can climate accords based on decentralized and voluntary agreements successfully reduce carbon emissions? We designed an economic experiment with a 2x3 factorial design to study the effectiveness of the best-known mechanisms that are supposed to foster international cooperation on climate change mitigation: climate pledges, financial penalties, and reputation. We test each of these mechanisms both separately and together. In the climate pledge treatments, participants could pledge their desired production target, approve targets by majority vote, and join the agreement. In the treatments with financial penalties, failure to meet pledges triggered monetary sanctions. In the reputation treatments, participants competed for a nonmonetary environmental prize (climate reputation) by ranking each other based on their decisions in the game. We find that most participants joined climate agreements and met their pledges, but pledges were insufficiently ambitious to curb climate change. Neither pledge-and-review, competition for reputation, nor financial penalties reduced emissions. The results question the effectiveness of the mechanisms behind climate agreements and call for more effective alternatives.	NA
2023	1697	PL06	Are Young Candidates Sacrificial Lambs? Evidence from the 2012, 2017 and 2022 French Legislative Elections	In recent years, many studies (Stockemer & Sundström 2018; 2021; 2022) have highlighted the underrepresentation of the youth in the parliaments of Western democracies. Although they make up a large share of the population, few young adults win seats in their country’s legislative elections. Yet voters do not appear to have a negative bias against young candidates (Eshima and Smith 2022; McLean & Ono 2022; Roberts & Wolak 2022). This research focuses on another factor that may contribute to youth underrepresentation: the level of competitiveness of the districts in which political parties choose to nominate candidates who are under 35. Using data from the 2012, 2017, and 2022 French legislative elections, it attempts to determine whether, similarly to women (Thomas & Bodet 2013) and visible minorities (Kulich, Ryan & Haslam 2014), young adults tend to be nominated in districts that they have little or no chance of winning. Two measures of district competitiveness are used. One is ‘static’ and the other is ‘dynamic’. Results show that young people – and especially young women – are more likely than others to be ‘sacrificial lambs’.	NA
2023	1892	GD02	Why are Congresswomen wealthier than Congressmen? Wealth and higher office in the United States	We introduce and seek to explain a new and surprising fact about members of the U.S. Congress: women in Congress have substantially higher household wealth than men serving in the same party, and this has been true since at least the 1980s. We articulate three mechanisms that could explain this gender wealth gap, and we use new data on members of Congress and their families to assess the relevance of each mechanism. We find no evidence that the wealth gap arises because districts that are more likely to elect women also generally tend to elect wealthier members. We find some evidence that the gap can be explained by women facing steeper challenges that wealth helps them overcome, and we find strong evidence that it is explained by women MCs' spouses earning more money than men MCs' spouses. Our analysis sheds light on how obstacles facing ambitious women can lead to apparently counterintuitive advantages among the women who manage to succeed.	NA
2023	1898	PL06	It is where you start that counts.' How distinctive career paths affect party rebellion.	Spatial analyses of parties’ position demonstrate that parties are not unified entities. Previous studies have systematically analysed determinants of MPs’ dissent behaviour without giving attention to candidates’ characteristics who represent a broader sample of politicians with distinctive career paths. Bringing in different range of theories from careerism, representation, and party congruence literature, I argue that politicians who have not had any ‘real’ job outside of politics before becoming a candidate and an MP follow the party line more than other candidates, whereas the rise of this type of politicians lead parties to become more centrist. Using cross-national evidence from the Comparative Candidate Study and Chapel Hill Expert Survey, I find evidence that careerists and party soldiers may adopt moderate views close to their party, whereas outsiders are more likely to deviate from the party line. The positional shifts of candidates are dependent of the probability of electoral success and age. This paper breaks a new ground making a new theoretical and empirical contribution on the field of professionalization, intra-party politics, and theories of spatial analysis.	NA
2023	269	PL06	Under which conditions do parties promote young candidates? A Qualitative Comparative Analysis	Research on the underrepresentation of youth in parliaments has so far focused on the intersection of age and gender, institutional effects of electoral systems, age requirements or quotas and voter preferences - but only rarely on societal context factors or political parties. This is quite astonishing as parties are central in the selection of candidates. We built a dataset of party parliamentary groups in advanced democracies between 2017 and 2020 and will conduct a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Building upon previous literature, we take societal context factors into account as well as party characteristics and expect the share of young MPs to be higher under the following conditions: a proportional representation electoral system, low age requirements for candidacy, a low/high median age of the population, relatively low GDP per capita, strong party youth organizations and an inclusive party ideology. By following and applying the newest guidelines on good practices in QCA research, including different robustness checks we will present one of the first applications of these in the contexts of party and representation research.

2023	339	PL06	Six Degrees of Slavery: Elite Persistence and Slave-Ownership in Britain	Despite its abolition nearly 200 years ago, the legacy of slavery in Britain continues to shape the country’s politics. The political and economic elite that coalesced around slave-derived wealth prior to the mid-19th Century was so firmly established that ties to slavery within Britain’s political institutions have persisted well into the post-abolition era. This project seeks to quantify and chart these ties over time, using a novel computational technique harnessing Wikipedia connections as a means of operationalising historical proximity between individuals. This technique enables the generation of a variable describing personal proximity to slavery, including via familial, social, and financial connections. Aggregating this data for MPs across a series of historical parliaments demonstrates how links to slavery persisted via dynastic and other social ties into the 20th Century, and the extent to which connections to slavery still exist among contemporary MPs. The results emphasise the extent to which slavery and its legacies continue to play an active role in Britain, as well as offering an efficient and reliable new method for measuring social proximity using online data.

2023	1409	M03	Using a Conjoint Experiment to Measure Social Identification	Social identity is a key variable in the social sciences. It is also notoriously hard to measure. We propose an innovative approach to measuring individuals’ social identification using a carefully designed conjoint experiment. In the conjoint experiment, we present respondents with a range of fictitious persons that differ along key socio-structural characteristics and ask them how much they identify with each of these persons. To analyze our conjoint experiment, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical linear model that makes use of auxiliary information to account for respondent heterogeneity and increase the precision of individual-level estimates. We demonstrate the utility of our approach for generating a variety of important quantities, such as subjective measures of individuals and group’s social identification with any desired social group, summary measures of the overall importance of chosen dimensions for social identification, or estimates of consensus or contestation concerning the salience of specific characteristics for social identification.

2023	311	M03	Nuancing Conjoint Experiments: Using Natural Language Processing to analyze decision reasoning	Conjoint experiments have increasingly gained popularity within the last decade to study multidimensional preferences in various fields of interest. However, we do not know much about the specific reasoning of individual respondents, which could allow us to identify specific decision-making patterns regarding the democratic assessment of policymaking. We aim to address this gap and enhance conjoint experiments with a systematic mixed methods approach by linking the outcome of conjoint experiments in the form of Individual Marginal Component Effects (IMCEs) with analysis of open-text field responses. Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing allow us to extract information like topics from a text systematically and automatically. The proposed strategy allows us to deepen our understanding of how respondents assess decision-making experiments and why they focus more on certain aspects than others – both on the level of subgroups and to identify individual patterns. Going beyond the analysis and results of stand-alone conjoint experiments, the combination with NLP allows us to better understand the motivation and reasoning behind specific decision-making processes, which can gather important insights into democratic behavior.

2023	321	M03	Ideology, Electability, and Valence	Political scientists frequently interpret the results of conjoint experiments in the context of electoral contests and with respect to voter preferences. In this paper, we present a design related to forced-choice conjoint experiments that allows researchers to recover meaningful quantities of interest for the entire distribution of voters and characterize how voters trade off candidate valence features (e.g. race, gender, and experience) with other attributes like ideology and electability. We then conduct a second experiment to recover respondent beliefs about unobserved candidate features and show that the identifying assumption required to interpret results of standard estimands as an average preference is unlikely met in many contexts. Finally, we combine the set of structural parameters describing voter preferences recovered from our first experiment with the results from our second experiment to show how researchers can conduct counterfactual simulations to understand the effects of candidate-attributes that operate through beliefs in specific electoral contests.

2023	793	M03	Implausible Profiles in Conjoint Experiments: Evidence from Eye-Tracking and Recommendations for Applied Research	Conjoint designs have become a common research tool to experimentally examine political behavior by letting respondents choose between two or more randomly composed profiles, such as candidates running for public office. While conjoint experiments reveal the relative causal weight of attributes in multidimensional choice behavior, implausible attribute combinations may weaken their external validity. Many applied conjoint studies in political science include attribute combinations that are implausible, which may irritate respondents and lead to distorted choice behavior and biased inference. Focusing on one of the most widely used conjoint designs in political science, a candidate choice experiment, we evaluate how respondents react to such implausible profiles when choosing between hypothetical political candidates. In a candidate choice experiment conducted in a laboratory, we leverage eye-tracking and evaluate whether profiles that are less representative of real candidates (implausible profiles) cause respondents to react differently in their eye movements (dissonance). Results will provide applied researchers with advice on how realistic profiles must be for undistorted inference from conjoint experiments and have implications for the design of and inference from conjoint studies.

2023	1062	FT02	Candidate Selection under Collective Policymaking	Nominating candidates for political office is a key function of political parties in representative democracies. If elected, a candidate's impact on policy outcomes depends on the broader political environment, as democratic policymaking involves multiple elected officials. We build a game-theoretic model to study how nomination incentives for policy-motivated (district) parties in a single member district election are shaped by the (national) political environment. Combining a standard model of electoral competition with a model of legislative bargaining, we show a party's relative national-level policymaking power is negatively correlated with the probability of winning the district election (holding fixed the voter distribution). The prediction is in line with empirically observed patterns of partisan balancing and midterm loss in US politics. Additional results focus on how nomination incentives change when elite party polarization increases, and when voter's perceptions of local candidates are contaminated by the national party.	NA
2023	1068	FT02	Testing Formal Models of Political Competition: Experimental Evidence from over 50,000 Candidate-Choices	There remains healthy skepticism regarding the assumptions and predictions of formal models of political competition. This study aims to address these critiques by leveraging data uniquely available from candidate-choice conjoint survey experiments. An advantage of candidate-choice conjoint experiments is that, by design, political candidates may adopt the full range of policy positions in hypothetical elections, including policy match-ups rarely observed in real-world elections. Leveraging this data, we define and estimate the 'empirical best response function' of political candidates in response to how survey-respondents vote over the full range of possible policy positions that candidates may take. We uncover conditional support for the convergence prediction of the median voter theorem. Moreover, we examine the degree of `rationality' of survey-respondents and find voters often, although not always, possess single-peaked preferences and, further, vote according to those preferences. Additionally, we provide empirical tests of several common attributes of formal models of political competition, including: valence advantage, multidimensional policies, and election turn-out. Our study serves to highlight the benefits and possibilities of candidate-choice experiments for formal theory.	NA
2023	1675	FT02	Have your Cake and Eat it Too? Intra-party Bargaining and the Micro-foundations of Populism	We develop a model of electoral competition in the context of multi-party systems, where policy platforms consist of traditional spatial positions and a policy in favor or against membership in an international union that imposes binding policy constraint on the traditional left-right dimension. We assume that parties consist of two factions, the Opportunists (office-seekers) and the Militants (ideologues), and we extend Roemer's (1998) Party Unanimity Nash Equilibrium (PUNE) concept for endogenously formed parties to derive a manifold of equilibria, ranging form moderate pro-membership, to populist, to polarized anti-membership ones. We then apply the Nash bargaining solution---by allowing for the possibility of party splits as disagreement outcomes---in order to refine our equilibrium predictions and infer under what conditions party splits are the more likely outcomes depending on the perceived benefits of union membership and the scope of policy constrains. We show how populism can arise as the outcome of intra-party bargaining that keeps the party together in the face of strong factionalism over supranational integration. A direct implication of our results is that populism can be innately cyclical.	NA
2023	810	FT02	Why and when local elections are hijacked by national politics	On paper, the role of local elections is to elect local politicians. However, an empirical literature finds that local campaigns and the decisions of local voters are often dominated by national issues. This paper proposes a model that explains the incidence of hijacking of local elections, and how it differs between localities and elections. It focuses on the choices of parties to either run campaigns and inform voters on local issues, or to ride on the coattails of the national environment. Building on the empirical observation that the distribution of partisanship differs between regions (e.g. some will have more left wing voters, others more right wing), it argues that a uniform shift in national opinion will affect incentives in different regions differently. In some regions, a national shift will push more voters into reach, making campaigning more beneficial. In others, the reverse. The paper then investigates differences between parties and the effects of polarization.	NA
2023	1730	EU04	Envisioning a regulatory or a redistributive polity - EU polity ideas and mainstream party ideology between 2009 and 2019	Throughout the EU's ‘polycrisis’ mainstream parties have remained mostly supportive of European Integration. However, they developed increasingly distinct ideal-typical polity ideas for the integration of the core state powers that produced the polycrisis. The regulatory polity encourages national self-reliance and regards EU institutions as rule-enforcers. Its adherents preferred to solve the Eurozone crisis through the stricter enforcement of deficit rules or the Migration crisis through stricter border management regulation. The redistributive polity builds on transnational solidarity and the creation of EU-level capacities for burden-sharing. Its proponents preferred Eurobonds and an EU-level border force. We study how mainstream parties’ ideology shapes their preference for a regulatory or redistributive core state power integration mode. We study this on voting advice application data for mainstream parties in all EU member states for the three EU elections between 2009 and 2019. We show that mainstream parties across the socio-economic left-right and the socio-cultural liberal and conservative dimension increasingly promote different kinds of integration. We argue that this growing rift provides voters with an increasingly meaningful choice between different normative conceptions of the EU.	NA
2023	692	EU06	The Europeanization of housing finance policy? Real Estate Interest Groups and the EU Regulatory Conditions for the Financialization of Housing	In his seminal work, Doling first defined a European housing policy “by stealth”, pointing at the EU's indirect influence on national housing policies since the Lisbon strategy. Yet, such a promising research path has been just occasionally walked by housing and European integration scholars, which focused mostly on the impact of the EU on single Member country cases. This is surprising if we consider the crucial role of real estate markets and housing financialization in the run-up, and response, to the European debt crisis. This paper aims to revive the debate on a ‘European housing policy’ by systematically process-tracing the role of the housing industry lobby in shaping EU financial regulation’s impact on housing policy. We argue that the influence of real estate industry organizations and large companies represents a key factor to explain the emergence of an EU favourable regulatory regime for housing financialization. The post-GFC context and the EU macro-economic governance created a favourable environment to frame real estate as a long-term and safe asset, crucial to lighten regulatory pressures.	NA
2023	998	EU01	The Role of Populist Actors in EU Policymaking on Childcare: Analysing the Evolution of the Barcelona Targets	Despite recent attempts to assess the impact of populist actors on the quality of EU governance, little is known about how exactly the populist strategy influences EU policymaking and, more specifically, decision-making in the Council. Previous literature has stressed the importance of investigating both informal practices that shape the democratic debate in the EU institutions and the expedient use of procedural rules to displace deliberation, compromise, and consensus. Barcelona Targets, originally set by the Council in 2002, aimed at increasing female labour-market participation by enhancing the provision of early childhood education and care (ECEC). Their long overdue revision was finally tabled alongside the European Commission's European Care Strategy on 7 September 2022. Using secondary document analysis, process tracing, and expert interviews, this paper investigates the behaviour of populist actors in the Council and, consequently, its impact on the negotiations on childcare policies in the EU. This important case of gender mainstreaming policymaking allows us to assess the impact of populist governments on a medium-to-low salient issue and compare it with previous studies on refugee distribution and economic sanctions.

2023	1822	PP10	To act or to react? – The European Environment Agency’s Priorities over Time	Despite the constant growth in power and resources among the 38 EU agencies, we know little about their substantive work in relation to the EU’s policy process. This is especially relevant for the numerous information-gathering agencies, who shall provide the Commission with information to develop further policies. Are these agencies agenda-setters or are they reacting to the priorities of the Commission? We seek to provide a first account of EU agencies’ substantial priorities over time through a text analysis of the European Environmental Agency’s (EEA) annual reports since its inception in 1993. We show how the EEA uses its discretion in gathering environmental data. Moreover, we contrast these priorities with an analysis of the priorities in the Commission’s environmental policy documents in the same time frame. We show how the EEA largely follows the Commission substantially but punctually sets its own agenda. Overall, our contribution provides first evidence how EU agencies substantially use their legal independence to explain when they aim to push the EU’s policy agenda and when they react to it.	NA
2023	371	EU07	Leveraging EU Trade Power for Climate – Advancing climate goals through preferential trade agreements and their bodies	While the main goal of the EU's preferential trade agreements (PTAs) is to advance market access for EU companies, the EU also relies on its trade power to promote foreign policy objectives vis-à-vis third countries in seemingly unrelated issue areas, such as climate change mitigation. The literature suggests that a major role for EU efforts to leverage its trade power for non-trade objectives falls to the bodies created by its PTAs to facilitate and institutionalize exchange and dialogue between the parties on matters covered by the agreements. Yet, so far, we know little about the mechanisms through which such bodies foster non-trade issues, including climate topics. How substantive are climate-related discussions? And what explains both the issue's insertion into the discussions and the way it is discussed between different trade partners? The paper presents newly compiled data to assess how climate-related issues feature at PTA meetings, primarily through analysis of meeting documents. It then theorizes and empirically tests what drives variation in climate-related discussions, linking meeting activities to PTA provisions as well as to strategic political priorities of the Commission.

2023	774	EU07	EU integration through a Greener lens: Building consensus around European integration	EU environmental policy is one of the success stories of European integration. In this paper, we argue that popular support for EU-centered environmental protection efforts has helped underpin the case for the legitimacy of this transnational body. By analyzing how European political parties frame the relationship between European integration and Green politics during the European Parliament (EP) elections, we aim to show the degree to which the Green Agenda can be used to (re)build consensus around European integration. We make use of Twitter data from all MEP candidates during the 2019 EP election campaign. Combining human coding and machine learning techniques, we identify the issue(s) in a given tweet, as well as the degree to which it expresses support for EU integration. We contrast the level of support for the EU in relation to environmental issues, with more general expressions of support for the EU among candidates. We show that when talking about environmental issues, the candidates of traditional Eurosceptic parties will soften their opposition towards the EU, especially if such issues are salient to them.	NA
2023	875	EU07	Representation of environmental issues in the European Parliament. From the campaign to the plenary.	Environmental concern increased among EU citizens before the 2019 European elections. Some candidates in these elections discussed environmental issues during the campaign, possibly responding to this increased concern. Moreover, the environment was a motivator to participate for some citizens, who possibly selected parties/candidates based on environmental issues, providing MEPs with a mandate to act on this EU policy. Nonetheless, the representation of citizens’ environmental concerns would be weak if representation is confined to the campaign period. This paper investigates whether MEPs are fulfilling their campaign commitments by assessing whether environmental salience during the campaign is related with casting pro-environmental votes. The latter is measured using the emissions’ reduction target that MEPs supported in the context of the European Climate Law. Environmental salience is computed through a content analysis of tweets (using a dictionary approach) that MEPs had posted during the campaign. Finding a relationship between MEPs environmental salience during the campaign and their vote in the plenary would suggest that citizens’ environmental concerns are represented at the EU level and that MEPs perform their task of representing EU citizens.

2023	941	EU07	Exploring the Harmonization of Climate Mitigation Commitments in the European Union	Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, there have been calls for increasing ambition of countries’ National Determined Contributions (NDCs) as global emissions are on track to exceed the 1.5˚C goal. While a pertinent task in combating climate change (CC), its effectiveness relies on countries ability to match their international commitments at the national level. A growing body of work on the vertical harmonization of CC mitigation commitments has quantified the gap between NDCs and national policies using the Vertical Policy Harmonization (VPH) Index and qualified the gap by studying the role of macro-level factors in driving vertical (dis)harmony. The European Union (EU) presents a puzzling case given the international commitments of EU member states are expressed as a collective effort under the EU’s NDC and the only national mitigation commitments of some members originate at the supranational level. The study presented here addresses these confounding aspects by comparing different aggregation of the VPH Index and assess the extent to which institutional settings and interests can explain the observed variation of commitment harmonization in the EU.

2023	1707	1707	Tracing the Role of the European Parliament in Albania's and North Macedonia's Accession Negotiations	The Western Balkan countries are those with the most apparent European integration perspective. Research has so far focused mainly on EU conditionality to explain the accession process. However, the process remains challenging, putting the continuous explanatory power of conditionality into question. Compared to the Council and the Commission, little attention has been paid to the influence of the European Parliament on the integration process of the Western Balkan candidate countries. This study focuses on the cases of Albania and North Macedonia, which recently started accession negotiations, to trace the European Parliament's influence on the decision-making process and outcome. I argue that the European Parliament can influence the decision-making process regarding accession negotiations in the context of parliamentary empowerment and as a result of relations with political parties in these two countries. The study draws on data on the membership of Albanian and North Macedonian political parties in the political groups of the European Parliament as a starting point for the analysis, a discourse analysis of the joint parliamentary committees in the EU, and interviews with members of parliament.

2023	553	EU10	How Public Opinion Polarisation Shapes Conflict in International Negotiations: Evidence from debates in the Council of the European Union	Research has shown that public opinion affects how governments act in international negotiations. We focus on the way in which the polarisation and salience of public opinion in states affects their approach to policy making on the international level. While we would expect debates in policy areas with polarised domestic public opinion and high salience to be highly conflictual, deliberations should be much more harmonious when salience and/or polarisation are low. We combine public opinion measures across policy areas in the member states of the European Union with a novel dataset of debates in the Council of the European Union between 2014 and 2022. Our paper contributes to scholars’ understanding of how domestic audiences’ preferences shape outcomes at the international level.	NA
2023	713	EU10	Entrapped in a Two-Level Game? Austrian and Dutch Leadership in Forging European Counter-Coalitions	Multiple crises in the European Union (EU) have caused steps towards deeper integration after difficult negotiations. A new development in staging opposition to such crisis-induced integration is the formation of publicly salient counter-coalitions formed by small states, such as the ‘New Hanseatic League’ in eurozone reform and the ‘Frugal Four’ in fighting the COVID-19 crisis. Why and how do small EU member states forge organized and public opposition? We argue that national governments can become entrapped by catering to Eurosceptic sentiments at the domestic level (post-functionalism) and simultaneously responding to functional necessities at the European level (neo-functionalism). Counter-coalitions strengthen their position, but make it harder to find solutions and sell them to their national audience. To assess our argument, we compare the roles of Austria and the Netherlands in forging the ‘Frugal Four’ and the ‘New Hansa’. Moreover, we add a case where small-state counter-coalitions have not (yet) emerged, namely the reform of European fiscal rules. By providing a two-level game explanation for the emergence of European counter-coalitions, we contribute to the research agenda of crisis-induced integration in the EU.	NA
2023	1219	EU08	Patterns of Attendance in the European Parliament: Who turns up, why, and what are the consequences	We explore the determinants of attendance of Members of the European Parliament as well as whether those who attend more are subsequently more likely to be re-elected or awarded with more senior roles. We test whether attendance is explained by legislative responsibilities such as voting in plenary or Committee and if so, we expect variation according to vote margins, votes’ importance, preference alignment with the party group leadership, as well as across party groups and policy areas. We then assess whether re-election and important positions within the EP are associated with attendance compared to mean attendance of the respective party group. We assembled a large dataset with information on daily attendance 2004-2022, including whether voting took place that day, votes’ outcomes as well as individual vote choices, representatives’ nationalities, national party affiliations, European Group affiliations, responsibilities in Parliament of each representative at any given day during the period of study, as well as a battery of controls such as policy areas, the weather that day in Brussels and the gender of the representatives.

2023	1238	PL06	Political Career Profiles of National Lead Candidates in Elections to the European Parliament	While recent scholarship has expanded our understanding on career paths of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the determinants of re-election and re-selection of incumbents and the influence of career ambitions on legislative activity, surprisingly little is known about the impact of career profiles on list placement in EP elections. The proposed paper seeks to fill this research gap by focusing on a particular subset of candidates: those who enter the EP as nation-wide lead candidates or top candidates for their constituency. Drawing on an original dataset that covers 180 candidates from 114 parties and 15 Member States, we address the following research questions: What experience have candidates acquired prior to running for a mandate as lead candidate? And what explains variation in the career profiles of lead candidates? We differentiate between experience in the executive, the legislature and within parties at both the subnational, national and European level. Our empirical analysis centers on two sets of explanatory variables: party goals (vote seeking, office seeking, policy seeking) and candidate selection procedures.	NA
2023	1689	EU08	Female leadership in the European Parliament	Women’s parliamentary presence has significantly increased worldwide, but has not been matched by a comparable increase in their access to positions of leadership within main political institutions. While important steps have been taken at the EU level, where three of the main institutions are currently chaired by a woman, only five of the EU27 states currently have a female chief executive, and the average rate of female ministers in national governments remains below 30%. The European Parliament is a perfect example of this paradox: with a 42% of female MEPs it scores quite high comparatively in terms of women’s representation. Yet, with the exception of the President, women are still quite rare in senior leadership positions. Few studies have specifically investigated the obstacles that prevent female politicians to access higher political offices in condition of a critical mass. To contribute filling this gap, this paper investigates the gendered dimension of political careers in a multilevel perspective by taking into account both the structural and individual-level factors that hinders female politicians’ access to positions of leadership in the EP.

2023	357	EU08	Language Choice and Career Advancement in the European Parliament	Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) may choose between the official languages of the EU, especially between English and their native language, when engaging in their legislative work. This, however, entails a trade-off between advancing vote-seeking goals and office- and policy-making goals. MEPs have an incentive to use their national languages to satisfy external demands for effective representation, the signaling of policy positions and priorities, and the provision of information to constituents. Internal demands favor English, however, which is the most widely shared language between EU actors and thus facilitates collaboration, internal information flow, and the establishment and maintenance of professional, political, and social networks. Using the corpus of speech from the 8th term of European Parliament, we explore two questions: first, which factors encourage reliance on English and, second, whether using English is associated with MEPs’ career advancement. Preliminary results suggest that MEPs in formal leadership positions, active participants in legislative work, and those with greater seniority are more likely to use English on the EP floor and frequent English use is indeed associated with career advancement.

2023	915	EU08	Cleavage Trade-offs and Politicisation: Evidence from Roll Call Votes in EU Immigration Policy	European politics is in a 'post-Rokkan' state: representatives and represented are increasingly cross-pressured by multiple cleavages and hence have to engage in issue weighting and trade-offs. When cross-pressured, how do political parties choose between two dimensions of political competition? Do we see clear prioritisation of one dimension over another consistently for all parties, and does politicisation matter consistently for all dimensions? To test our novel hypothesis on issue dimension competition, we leverage EP roll call voting data of over 400 national parties, ParlGov, CHES and Eurobarometer data, combined with our dataset scaling the entire EU immigration acquis (1995-2018) on the pro/anti-immigration and the pro/anti-EU dimensions. We find that the EU dimension is clearly negotiable, as it appears to 'follow' the immigration dimension. We furthermore find that the EU issue dimension is more sensitive to politicisation and particularly in the case of niche parties. While substantive issue dimensions appear immune to public opinion shifts, the European issue dimension has the potential to shake up political competition.	NA
2023	1221	EU12	Ideology and Representation in Committee Organisation in the European Parliament	We provide a comprehensive analysis of the committee system in the European Parliament from 2004 to 2022. Using novel preference data, we show that the committees are highly representative of the plenary. Further, we show that preference heterogeneity is similar across committees and more variation is present over time than across committees. Contrary to the distributional and party-political theories of legislative organisation, ideology does not predict committee membership. It is previous membership – expertise – that is the most robust predictor of committee membership. We use original data on individual preferences of all members of Parliament combined with web scraped contextual information such as birthdates, nationalities, national party affiliations, European party group affiliations, gender, and committee functions, i.e., chairmanships, vice-chairmanships, memberships, and substitute memberships. For each of the committee functions, we collected exact start and end dates and constructed committee membership over the eighteen-years period. We contribute to the literature on legislative organisation and provide evidence in favour of the informational theory of legislative organisation. The findings suggest that one should not expect biased policy from the Parliament’s committee system.	NA
2023	1848	EU12	Preferences for European debt mutualization during and after the Covid-19 pandemic: Evidence from survey experiments in Germany and Italy	Existing research suggests that public opinion poses an insurmountable obstacle to debt mutualization in the eurozone. Voters in northern countries are pictured as fundamentally opposed to debt sharing, while voters in southern countries are depicted either as favorable to austerity or as unwilling to leave the euro, which constrains the ability of their governments to push for more fiscal integration. In this paper, we challenge these conclusions. Based on two survey experiments conducted in Germany and Italy in 2020 and 2022, we show that German public opinion depends on the strategic assessment of the costs (high or low) of a euro breakup. Surprisingly, the German public does not oppose risk-sharing through transfers or central bank bond purchases, while it remains slightly unfavorable to eurobonds. In turn, Italians are strongly opposed to austerity, especially as tax increases but also as expenditure cuts and structural reforms. Their hostility remains even when the potentially high costs of Italexit are highlighted. Our results are consistent across the 2020 and the 2022 experiments, suggesting a path toward further fiscal integration is possible.	NA
2023	307	EU09	Blame and Credit Strategies Towards the EU: Evidence from 10 Years of Parliamentary Speeches	As a result of policy responses to recent crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Eurozone crisis, economic policy-making at the European Union (EU) level is increasing. However, its multi-level governance structure makes it hard to discern who is responsible for policy outcomes. This can create incentives for politicians, including Members of Parliament (MPs), to blur the lines of responsibility through communication strategies. Which factors determine how MPs in Member States (MS) of the EU assign responsibility for economic crisis management to the EU? The paper addresses this question through the theoretical lens of blame and credit strategies, distinguishing between institutional and preference-based factors. Using parliamentary speeches, the paper combines dictionary methods and sentiment analysis to examine how MPs in 4 EU MS strategically communicated about the EU in recent economic crises. The findings can inform debates about the direction of democratic accountability in the EU in policy-making and academic circles.	NA
2023	637	EU04	Integrating the East with Western Logics? Cleavage Structures of European Cultural Project Funding	To what extent do structural imbalances between Western and Eastern European countries occur in EU’s cultural project funding programs? The Commission is repeatedly confronted with the allegation that participation in the EU’s funding programs overproportionately benefits actors from already established member states whereas applicants from new Eastern European member states have relatively harder times in adjusting to the specific requirements. However, these structural imbalances are not based on solid empirical evidence. For this reason, data on all cultural projects since the early 2000s is compiled and systematically analysed with statistical methods. For historical reasons, an imbalance is most likely to be found between Western and Eastern Europe. It is therefore questionable whether the two most important factors – administrative capacities and the availability of co-financing – can be held accountable for potential imbalances. If Western European countries outperform Eastern European countries both in obtaining funds and in these technical components, this could grow the suspicion that project funding is based on Western logics as Eastern European countries are systematically disadvantaged in core factors affecting the performance in obtaining funds.

2023	681	EU12	Eurosceptics in the European Parliament? Gaining Influence on the Legislative Process or Eternal Losers?	Although Eurosceptics have been present in the European Parliament (EP) since the first direct EU elections, it is assumed that they lack any form of legislative influence. While Eurosceptic MEPs have most used the parliament as a platform for their political views, only a few of them have been involved in the daily work of the institution. The low level of internal cohesion of Eurosceptic groups and the “cordon sanitaire” applied by the other groups have also contributed to their low level of legislative influence. Yet we know little about the Eurosceptics’ level of influence in the EP. This paper will discuss and measure the extent to which Eurosceptic party groups can have an influence when voting in plenary. Specifically, this contribution will determine the conditions for Eurosceptics to be influential on a given vote (cohesion, grand coalition, polarisation) and will investigate for which type of vote these conditions are met. This paper will rely on roll-call vote data from the 8th and the 9th legislative terms.	NA
2023	162	M06	Too good to be true? Machine learning for validating survey data	Many National Statistical Institutes (NSI) employ surveys to gather data, and since survey data is prone to measurement error, these organizations also work to assure the quality of the data. Processes of quality assurance involve a validation process that is usually manual, which renders the process time consuming, unclear and dependent on individuals. At the same time, learning from previous data and other data sources to predict the likelihood of a correct survey answer is a task that is well suited for machine learning. In this paper, I use the survey from Statistics Norway on enterprises' research and development (R&D) efforts to show how machine learning algorithms can improve efficiency, transparency and transferability in the validation process, thus also improving the overall quality of the data.

2023	2030	M06	Natural Language Processing for Short Survey Responses	Open answer questions in survey questionnaires allow researchers to organically learn about topics salient to the respondent population. However, large numbers of interviews mean hand-coding open answer responses is often cost prohibitive. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically topic modeling, can drastically reduce the cost of coding open answer responses, while increasing the degree of nuance researchers can track. The successful application of topic model algorithms allows researchers to uncover salient categorical data, as well as track how those categories change over time. In this paper, I present the current topic modeling methods, address their appropriateness for short survey responses, and introduce topic models using word embeddings and cluster analysis. Word embeddings reduce data loss seen in latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and structural topic models (STM), and offer a more intuitive theoretical foundation.	NA
2023	49	M06	Coming Out in National Probability Surveys: How Tolerance Shapes Outgroup Identification – The Case of LGBT People in the European Union	Social scientists have shown growing interest in studying minorities‘ behavior and attitudes. However, estimates may be biased when certain minority individuals can and feel a need to conceal their identity from researchers due to stigma. The following study makes use of four waves of Special Eurobarometer surveys on discrimination in the EU conducted between 2009 and 2019. More precisely, I estimate three cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) to examine whether greater tolerance in a country increases outgroup identification in the surveys or whether outgroup identification leads to greater tolerance when minority identities can be concealed. I expect that greater tolerance in a country will have the strongest effect on LGBT identification given that this group has the greatest leeway in concealing its minority identity. I also estimate two placebo models for disabled people and ethnic minorities, whose minority identity is more visible and therefore more difficult to hide in front of pollsters. As hypothesized, I find evidence in favor of a greater tolerance increasing minority identification for LGBT people in the surveys, but no effects for disabled people and ethnic minorities.	NA
2023	670	M06	Explaining Unit-nonresponse and Panel Attrition Among Immigrant-origin Voters in an Address-based Local Campaign Panel Survey	In population surveys, response rates are often lower for immigrant-origin groups than for natives. This participation difference can be explained by several factors, most notably individual characteristics of target persons (such as gender, formal education) as well as context-level factors (such as local unemployment rates). However, we often lack information on individual characteristics for non-respondents, but are able, in the case of multi-stage surveys to use information from earlier participation for later stage non-respondents. This study combines contextual information from the borough level, sampling frame information (e.g. age, gender) and survey data from the IMGES II, conducted as a longitudinal campaign survey during the 2021 German federal election in Duisburg, a Western German metropolis. The two-stage design based on a population registry sample makes it possible to analyse participation in a postal screening wave and a subsequent three-wave CATI survey among natives and three immigrant-origin groups. Preliminary results show that the same sets of target person’s individual characteristics and borough-level variables including COVID-19 incidence rates contain different explanations for unit-nonresponse in all survey stages for the sampled origin groups.

2023	1266	M04	Mainstream Stigmatization of Radical Right Parties: Evidence from Audio Data	Many European party systems include radical right parties challenging the political mainstream. In most cases, radical right parties have become entrenched features of party systems, yet still subject to stigmatization and exclusion from government. However, apart from this exclusion, it is unclear how mainstream party behavior reflects, and in turn sustains, radical right party stigma. We offer a novel perspective on this question, using audio data as a window into micro-level party competition. Specifically, we argue that politicians sustain radical right party stigma in part by using more rousing and indignant speech when addressing radical right partes. To test our theory, we compile a large collection of audio recordings spanning thousands of speeches in the Danish parliament, and develop and validate a speech-level measure of indignation. Consistent with the theory, we find that mainstream politicians disproportionately express indignation toward radical right parties, and that indignation increases with political distance. We are the first to use audio data in the study of party competition. Our findings shed new light on how elite behavior sustains party reputations and mass affective polarization.	NA
2023	1755	M04	Let them eat pie! Addressing the partial contestation problem in multiparty electoral contests	Although most scholars acknowledge that district-level election results are compositional variables, few model them as such. Instead, they tend to model the shares of single parties across districts. This is mostly the case because of partial contestation – situations in which not all parties field candidates in every electoral district. We evaluate potential solutions to address the problem of partial contestation using compositional models. The dominant approach is to estimate seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models using only fully contested districts. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this approach and other strategies that are often used are biased when partial contestation follows a selection process. Based on Heckman (1979), we propose an unbiased two-stage modeling strategy in which a party’s decision of whether or not to contest a particular district is the first stage, and a compositional model of the resulting competition is the second one. We test this compositional-selection model against other strategies using simulated and real-world data and find encouraging results.	NA
2023	209	M04	Parties’ Group Appeals Across Space and Time: An Effort Towards an Automated, Large-Scale Analysis of Parties’ Election Manifestos	A growing political science scholarship substantively distinguishes parties’ group-based appeals from policy appeals, the latter referring to the policies parties claim to support / oppose and the former to the specific social groups mentioned in parties’ statements. While both are prevalent in parties’ election materials, existing large-scale datasets focus primarily on policy-based appeals, with little data available for empirical analyses of group-based appeals. Moreover, the extensive resources needed to generate these data via hand-coding and the complexity of automating such text analysis challenge new collection efforts. However, examining group appeals is important for understanding party behavior, representation, and party-voter linkages. In this paper, we propose to address this data gap by automating group appeals’ extraction from political texts using valid, multilingual input lexicons in joint aspect-detection and sentiment analysis to identify the social groups appealed to and whether the appeals are positive or negative. As a test case, we analyze manifestos of major British and German parties since the 1970s, showing our approach’s benefits for revealing important trends in party behavior, with implications for party competition, voter behavior, and representation.

2023	447	M04	A global scale of economic left-right party positions: exploring the cross-national and cross-expert perceptions of party placements.	In this paper, we examine the cross-national comparability of expert placements of political parties on the left-right dimension using a novel data set that combines data from Europe, Latin America, Australia, Israel, and the United States. Through the use of anchoring vignettes and Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling (BAM), we explore whether there is evidence of region, country or expert-level differential item functioning (DIF), in terms of how experts perceive party placements on an economic left-right dimension. Basically, is a 7 on the economic left-right a 7 in Sweden, Chile and the United States? We test these claims using Bayesian Multilevel Models to predict each respondent’s perceptual distortion parameters (DIF “shift” and “stretch” terms). The models show that there are no systematic biases in perceptions of party placements for either term at the region, country, and expert level. More generally, our results clearly support the claim that the economic left-right dimension travels well across the globe.	NA
2023	1470	IP02	England's Inglorious Monetary Revolutions: Central Bank (In)dependence and the Origins of the Gold Standard Regime	Few analyses of political economy have proven influential than has North and Weingast's 1989 classic on credible commitments and the Glorious Revolution. It sparked the (massive) literature on central bank (in)dependence, democractisation, and development. Yet, this literature largely overlooks the simultaneous revolution in the monetary system: the birth of the unalterable, fixed metallic standard. Dating back to the Norman Conquest, England's exchange rate regime had been fixed but (highly!) adjustable. By shifting to the permanently fixed regime in the 1690s, the English sovereign relinquished its rights to reduce its (real) public debt burden through currency depreciation. Moreover, archival manuscripts reveal the cleavage between the Bank of England's champions and those who imposed the shift toward the fixed regime. Indeed, the latter argued that it was all the more necessary *because* the newly created banks (including the Bank of England) would inflate credit and further depreciate the pound. Seen in this light, the early Bank of England appears as an engine of (relatively) soft money, a mechanism to steer credit toward the Treasury, and as a highly *dependent* 'central bank.'	NA
2023	167	IP02	Partisan Politics And The Effectiveness Of IMF Scapegoating	Governments often use and then blame international organisations like the International Monetary Fund for enacting domestically unpopular policies. Such blame-shifting or scapegoating is attractive for politicians, especially in times of economic crisis. We have a limited understanding of blame-shifting effectiveness shielding incumbent governments from public dissent. Previous research focussed at the national level leaving the micro-level implications of the scapegoating argument untested. If scapegoating works, governments should benefit from higher approval and higher chances of re-election, compared to a situation where they would have attempted reforms on their own. We re-assess the scapegoating argument through a distributional politics lens, which helps explain some inconsistent findings of previous research. We contend that governments protect their own supporters from the costs of adjustment and burden those who support the opposition. Blame-shifting appeals may be a cynical emollient by governments towards those whom they target with the pain of adjustment as a strategy to manage excessive levels of opposition. We use Latinobarometer survey data to analyse how scapegoating in the context of IMF programs affects political attitudes of government and opposition supporters.	NA
2023	1845	1845	Exchange rate regimes, labor market regulations, and economic performance: questioning conventional wisdom	What is the relationship between exchange rate regimes and economic economic performance? Despite the enormous importance of the question and extensive literature, academics and practitioners have not succeeded in coming up with a definitive answer. In this paper, we argue that the relationship might be conditional on labor market institutions, specifically labor market flexibility. According to the optimum currency area theory, countries with more flexible labor markets should perform better under fixed exchange rate regimes. We analyse the long-run economic growth and recovery after shocks advancing the hypothesis that, for countries that have fixed currency regimes, those with more flexible labor markets will perform better. Surprisingly, we find the opposite results, in contrast to standard neo-classical explanations and common policy prescriptions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this finding, including the potential clash with the conventional wisdom in policy circles.	NA
2023	2006	IP02	Perfect Scapegoats? Blaming and Defending the International Monetary Fund	When do governments blame International Organizations (IOs)? The blame avoidance literature suggests that IOs are easy targets for shifting blame for contested policies because they lack access to domestic media and have complex decision-making structure. However, the degree to which a government blames an IO varies both across countries and within-countries over time. We argue that governments’ decision to scapegoat IOs reflects a trade-off between blame avoidance and policy gains. Specifically, blaming IOs detours domestic discontent toward the respective IO, but also provokes resistance against IO policies. In contrast, defending IOs attracts public dissatisfaction toward the government, but helps to reach domestic acceptance of IO policies. We further theorize factors that make blame avoidance or policy gains more important for governments. To test our theoretical argument, we focus on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an oft-cited IO to be a scapegoat and draw on an original global dataset of over 600 statements on the IMF by national leaders. The paper has important implications for the growing public contestation over IOs and international cooperation.	NA
2023	575	IP02	Reconsidering the Relationship between Central Bank Independence and Fixed Exchange Rates: A Third-Generation Framework	Governments face competing demands on how to use monetary policy to address different policy concerns including but not limited to inflation control. Yet, political scientists lack a theoretical framework for the study of monetary institutions like central bank independence (CBI) and fixed exchange rates (FIX) in the current macroeconomic context. Previous research was built on the assumption that these monetary institutions should be studied together as a response to the same economic problem (inflation control). The focus was on understanding under what conditions FIX and CBI function as institutional substitutes or complements. In this paper, we seek to reconnect the scholarship on CBI and FIX within a new (third-generation”) framework that considers multiple macroeconomic objectives (with a focus on inflation control and exchange rate stability), while recognizing how these policy goals and monetary institutions are often in tension with each other. We evaluate untested hypotheses within the “second-generation” framework regarding whether CBI and FIX function as substitutes or as complements in terms of inflation control, finding little support for either proposition. Results provide evidence consistent with our framework’s macrofoundations.	NA
2023	1659	IP04	State Influence on UN Multilateral Aid through Bureaucratic Ties	Do states benefit from having their nationals on the staff of international organizations (IOs) and, if so, how? We know that states seek to get their nationals hired into senior positions at IOs, but the reasons behind this are less well-understood. In addition, we know much less about attempts by member states to place their nationals in staff-level positions in IOs. I show that the policy preferences of IOs are more similar to those countries that have many of their nationals employed at the IO. In addition, I find that not all countries have an equal ability to get their nationals hired by IOs. Examining an original dataset on UN staff nationalities, I show that major donors to voluntarily-funded UN development agencies have a larger number of their nationals on staff than do similar non-major donors. I further demonstrate that those agencies' aid portfolios look more similar to countries that have a large number of their nationals on the agency's staff. This suggests that staffing can be a important mechanism through which member states influence IOs.	NA
2023	362	IP04	Aid Politics at Home and Abroad: Downstream Consequences of the Global Gag Rule	How do domestic politics in the world’s largest donor country condition aid effectiveness? This paper investigates the consequences of the Global Gag Rule (GGR) – one of the most prominent examples of aid politicization – which was first enacted in 1984 and prohibited abortion-related activities by NGOs receiving USAID funding. The policy has been subsequently revoked by every Democratic President and reinstated by every Republican. Analyzing cross-national time-series data from 1990 to 2019 for 149 countries, I find that maternal mortality in aid-recipient countries is higher when the GGR is in effect and when Republicans control both houses of Congress, while the presence of skilled birth attendants is lower. HIV deaths in recipient countries also increase when the GGR is in place, reflecting the policy's broader chilling effects. The paper also presents evidence for intermediate outcomes and mechanisms — suggesting US funding for HIV and reproductive and maternal health has been affected by political business cycles, with consequences for project effectiveness. A case study of Uganda, one of the world's primary health aid recipients, illustrates the downstream burden of politicized aid.	NA
2023	703	IP04	Targeting Gender Equality through Foreign Aid	Although the rhetoric of gender equality is ubiquitous within the international development community, the practice of prioritizing women's rights in assistance programs varies considerably across recipient countries. We theorize how political considerations, related to regime survival and policy cues in recipient states, shape the inclusion of gender equality as a policy goal in Western aid projects. Drawing information from the OECD’s Gender Equality Policy Marker (GEPM), we divide projects according to whether policy goals are more or less threatening to regime survival. Our analysis reveals differences in how Western donors engage with democracies and autocracies on women's rights. In autocracies, donors adopt a more cautious approach: tailoring their gender-related goals toward social sector projects rather than politically-sensitive projects related to democracy and governance. Donors also respond more to policy cues in autocracies, avoiding targeting gender in regimes with low female representation and low de jure rights. By uncovering the recipient-level conditions under which donors prioritize gender equality, our inquiry sheds new light onto debates about the domestic effects of aid, as well as how Western donors interact with autocrats.

2023	751	IP04	Lead, follow, or get out of the way: Evidence from donor participation decisions in collective development initiatives	When and how do donors cooperate? While a growing literature emphasizes the importance of donor coordination for aid effectiveness, little is known about when and why donors join forces to advance common causes. We leverage the proliferation of special-purpose trust funds at multilateral organizations to cast light on this issue. We argue that not only the decision whether to engage but also when to engage—notably as lead donor—carries important (yet overlooked) informational value. In particular, donors become founding donors to to highlight their expertise to domestic and international audiences. We test these expectations using a novel dataset of time-stamped funding commitment decisions by 27 OECD/DAC donors in 122 World Bank trust funds established between 1995 and 2019. The results have important implications for our understanding of donor coordination in an increasingly crowded multilateral development architecture.	NA
2023	921	IP02	Do voters reward politicians for foreign aid? Experimental evidence from Malawi	While many worry that aid will entrench incumbence, empirical evidence is mixed. We develop a model of retrospective accountability to illustrate how foreign aid can be a double edged sword, often harming rather then helping incumbents in elections. To test our argument, we conducted in-person surveys with 2,331 citizens around a sample of 180 schools in Malawi before and after the delivery of a foreign aid project. Additionally, we conducted a SMS information experiment which varied voter knowledge about the origin of the foreign aid project. Voters who live in an area that received aid were more likely to anticipate voting for incumbent councillors. Further, we show that aid increased the number of visits by incumbents and we provide anecdotal evidence of more credit claiming activity by politicians. The results of the SMS experiment, however, show a sizable backlash against incumbents among those who failed to benefit from aid. Collectively, these finding imply highly variable net effects of foreign aid on electoral outcomes.	NA

While 90 percent of global GDP is now covered by a net zero commitment, these pledges vary significantly in detail and robustness. We introduce a novel dataset that measures both the quantity and quality of net zero targets of states and the world’s 500 largest listed companies between 2015 and 2022 and seek to explain the diffusion of these targets across both actors and time.

2023	722	IP16	Climate Action from Abroad:Assessing Mass Support for Cross-Border Climate Compensation	Resource transfers from developed to developing countries to help prevent and adapt to climate change play a central role in international climate policy efforts. At the same time, countries are domestically grappling with how to provide these transfers. A growing literature explores the economic logics and efficiency of international climate finance, yet the politics seem to be particularly difficult, partly because publics are often biased towards public policy at home rather than abroad. This paper examines how the design of climate support packages influences public support for them using original survey data from the United States and India. We find compelling evidence that efficiency considerations do not drive preferences toward climate transfers. Economic costs and efficiency motivations, while certainly important, only explain part of the public attitudes towards climate investments. Instead, salient in voters’ minds are climate justice considerations that take into account vulnerability and compensation, along with with other normative political factors such as reciprocity by other developed countries and domestic agency in transfers. Political dimensions of climate finance could therefore ignite more interest in supporting climate action abroad.	NA
2023	1323	PP02	Insecurity and the Welfare State: Closing the Security Gap?	We seem to be living in an age of insecurity. However, some are likely to be more vulnerable to shocks than others, indicating that we may not expect insecurity to be equally distributed across the population. In this paper, we first examine how subjective insecurity is distributed. We find that poor people are in fact more insecure. We then turn to the question of whether welfare states with their promise of ‘equal security for all’ can reduce this gap, a question which has been largely absent from comparative welfare state research. Using multilevel models with cross-national data for about 19,000 individuals in 20 advanced democracies from the OECD’s Risks That Matter (RTM) survey, we find that the welfare state does in fact have the capacity to reduce insecurity among the population. However, welfare state interventions do not meaningfully reduce inequalities in insecurity among income groups. We complement this with national survey data from Denmark (2004-2021). We not only see that insecurity has increased, but also that there is a growing security gap, echoing the cross-national findings.	NA
2023	1456	IP01	A protective shield for employees? The case of WTO trade disputes by the US	Scholars have been widely studying political and economic determinants of WTO dispute settlement participation. Yet, the underlying mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this article, I focus on one causal mechanism to explain why larger (bilateral) sectoral trade leads to a higher likelihood of trade disputes. I argue that governments have strategic incentives to protect domestic industries that employ a larger share of workers against breaches of international trade agreements because these could create negative repercussion on the market competition level and thus lead to firm closure and unemployment. I test these assumptions with a logistic regression on a new dataset that combines sectoral trade data with sectoral employment data for 12 sectors in the US from 1995 to 2020. The findings show that higher sectoral trade and larger employment shares increase the probability of initiating a WTO trade dispute. Moreover, I extend the analysis to other forms of trade disputes to corroborate my findings. This study suggests that employment shares influence political decisions and that governments initiate more trade disputes when foreign trade policies harm large sectors.	NA
2023	1471	BO049	Risk Exposed: Does Workplace Risk Exposure shape Social Insurance Attitudes?	Besides redistribution across income classes, one of the core features of the welfare state is to mitigate the risk of unemployment through social insurance. Traditional models propose that exposure to risks at the occupational and industry level are significant predictors of individual-level preferences for social insurance. In this paper, I examine whether workplace risk exposure – a related but stronger signal about the risk of future unemployment – shapes attitudes toward social insurance. Linking novel population-wide administrative records tapping the official proportion of workplace colleagues becoming unemployed from one year to the next with a three-wave panel survey, I confront common theoretical and methodological challenges in existing work. My findings show that citizens rely on cues about the risk of future unemployment from their workplace when forming attitudes toward social insurance. Furthermore, I show that the effect is strongest when colleagues with shared are fired, which suggests that self-interested concerns drive the results.	NA
2023	1548	PP02	CAN SUPPORT FOR REDISTRIBUTION BE MAINTAINED IN HIGH-CRIME SOCIETIES?	In recent years, young democracies have vastly expanded anti-poverty social assistance programs. While such programs were initially met with broad support across deeply unequal societies, the slowing of macroeconomic growth in recent years has laid bare the costs and tradeoffs imposed by social protection on government budgets, raising questions about the political sustainability. We hypothesize that individuals who are more physically and economically secure will be more supportive of redistribution while individuals who are less secure should be less committed to redistribution to the poor. The mechanism we propose is through the effect of insecurity on authoritarian values such as xenophobia, vigilantism, and support for the death penalty. We test this hypothesis in South Africa through analysis of original household survey data of 1,500 households and representative focus group discussions consisting of over 100 individual citizens. Analysis of the survey data reveals broad public support for social welfare programs across society, but this commitment weakens among individuals who are more insecure. We demonstrate the mediating role of authoritarian values on support for redistribution among more insecure citizens.	NA
2023	1872	1872	When Central Banking Becomes Costly: The Politics of Unconventional Monetary Policies and its Trade-offs	Central banks around the world massively expanded the use of unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) in response to the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. As these policies have significant distributional effects, they became strongly politicized. Especially as inflation increased, calls to end UMPs became widespread. Despite their distributive consequences and politicization, the political implications of UMPs remain poorly understood. In particular, we know very little about public opinion toward these different UMPs. We use two survey experiments conducted in Germany and the Netherlands to assess people’s preferences. First, a conjoint survey shows that the interest rate is the most salient measure for respondents. A majority of respondents are opposed to negative rates, while they are open to forward guidance and quantitative easing, especially if the latter is tied to debt and environmental stability concerns. Second, a framing experiment shows that opposition to negative rates is driven by both ego-tropic and sociotropic concerns. Respondents are particularly concerned about inflation, but they also strongly respond to arguments about the effect of negative rates on income and wealth inequalities.	NA
2023	1026	FT05	Understanding the “refugee roulette”: A two-sided incomplete information game of discriminatory asylum decision-making	Various studies have discovered considerable inequities in the chance of asylum-seekers with similar claims and backgrounds to obtain protection. The wide-spread arbitrariness in refugee status determination has, however, not yet received proper micro-foundations that trace this “asylum lottery” or “refugee roulette” to the behavior of the two key actors in the decision on an asylum requests – the applicant and the responsible case worker. In this article, I introduce a two-sided incomplete information game in which the asylum-seeker is uncertain about the potential bias of the first instance decision-maker and this “street level” bureaucrat is in return unsure how credible the claims by the applicant are. The model allows to derive how these two crucial parameters influence the risk of wrongful decisions and how unbiased adjudication lowers the potential for positive and negative discrimination. The model implications will be illustrated with case studies from German administrative courts.	NA
2023	1781	FT05	Deals to Stop Alliances	How do states react to the anticipation of a new alliance forming against them? In contrast to previous work that has focused on the use of war to stop impending alliances, we study how targeted states may strike quid-pro-quo ``deals'' with potential allies. In these deals, targeted states offer concessions to states planning to ally against them. In exchange, the potential allies forego implementation of a new alliance. Consequently, the threat of a new alliance is eliminated. To illustrate this logic and trace its consequences, we analyze a dynamic formal model of alliance formation, negotiations, and conflict. We illustrate the strategic dynamics embodied in the model by tracing the logic in documentation from the historical record, tying our results to the Cuban missile crisis, the Baghdad pact, and U.S. commitments in east Asia in the 1950s.

2023	2009	FT05	Conservation for Sale: International Bargaining over Payment for Ecosystem Services	When will countries with conflicting interests be able to reach agreements to conserve natural resources? We consider the case where one country controls a non-renewable resource that they prefer to consume, while another country prefers that it be preserved. The consumption process is dynamic, in that the owner can consume one unit of resource at a time, and there is limited commitment on the owner's part. The owner cannot sell the resource to the conservationist, and they cannot promise to conserve, or even consume, the resource when it is not in their interest to do so. We show that whenever the owner of the resource can consume any unprotected parcels, then leakage prevents conservation until the resource reaches a set size, after which it will be conserved in perpetuity. We also find when countries are patient, the owner of the resource captures none of the surplus value from conservation. There is, however, an ecological benefit from having the resource holding country make demands. We end by considering the effect of market price shocks on the level of steady state conservation.	NA
2023	586	FT05	Political Brinkmanship: US Debt Ceiling	US debt ceiling crises are a recurrent result of political brinkmanship: we explore theoretically how such brinkmanship tactics can affect gridlock, bargaining power and welfare in US budget negotiations. Failure to agree in any period implies, as in bargaining models, a status-quo disagreement payoff and a continuation of the negotiation. However, under brinkmanship, agreement failure in any period may precipitate with a small chance a debt de- fault/crisis, namely an outcome worse than the status-quo and than any budget agreement. In equilibrium, such brinkmanship threats improve gridlock, i.e. the scope/speed of agreement, but also increase the risk of default/crisis. Brinkmanship reduces welfare when one might think it is most needed: severe gridlock. In this case, despite this global welfare loss, a party has incentives to use brinkmanship strategically to obtain a favorable bargaining position.	NA
2023	1296	FT03	Fact-Checking, Media Competition and Political Accountability	We present a dynamic model of elections in which the incumbent politician decides whether to participate in a corruption scandal and different news outlets receive information about his behaviour and compete to break the news. Media outlets can decide whether to break the story immediately or wait and fact-check. We show that, as competition increases, each outlet becomes more likely to publish unverified news. Finally, we show that political accountability is non-monotonic in the degree of competition.	NA
2023	1828	FT03	Freedom of Information and Policy-Making	In this paper, using a game-theoretical model where policy experimentation meets a disclosure game, I study the implication of imposing disclosure mandates (i.e., banning public agents from concealing information about their decisions). Specifically, I focus on the disclosure mandates' implications on the agent's incentives to continue a failing policy (``doubling down'') only to leave a good impression on the principal. The result is that disclosure mandates can discourage the agent from continuing a failing policy when doing so can severely damage her legacy. The second result is that the minimum damage that the disclosure mandates discourage doubling down decreases as a replacement is strong (e.g., a competitive election) or/and the principal's ability to access and use the disclosed information improves. The third result is that the disclosure mandates induce policy conservatism when they discourage doubling down. Lastly, I show that the gain in the principal's ability to select an agent by disclosure mandates also increases as the severity of the damage from a failing policy increases.	NA
2023	1879	FT03	Politicians, Bureaucrats, and the Battle for Credit	Politicians may want to claim credit from bureaucrats when things go well and deflect blame when outcomes go awry. How does blaming and crediting affect the successful implementation of policies and what are the constraints that reputation-concerned politicians face in blaming or crediting bureaucrats? To answer these questions, we study a principal-agent model where a bureaucrat cares about his reputation vis-`a-vis an interested audience, and the politician can blame the bureaucrat for failed policies or give credit for successes via cheap talk. We show that the bureaucrat can be induced to exert more effort by the threat of blaming and crediting. There are, however, two constraints in inducing effort, which are shaped by dynamic considerations for future effort and for the effect on the politician’s own reputation after blaming and crediting.	NA
2023	2045	2045	Verifiable Advice to a Biased Policy-maker: Political Leaders and the 'Deep State'	We develop a model of verifiable communication between a biased policymaker and a bureaucratic agency with a preference for maintaining the status quo. We show that, in the absence of additional utility pressures on the agency, an increase in the policymaker's bias leads the agency to disclose more information. A key intuition for this result, which contrasts with a key conclusion of the cheap-talk literature, is that, in equilibrium, the lack of an informative message from the agency functions is a signal to the policymaker that credibly compels her to choose more radical policies, with the agency being forced to reveal in order to hold back the policy radicalism. We also show that, while introducing the possibility of a utility bonus for revelation results in increased agency revelation, it can reverse the positive effect of the policymaker’s bias on revelation and hinder the disclosure of additional information to more biased policymakers. Finally, we demonstrate that the higher bias of the policymaker exacerbates the asymmetry in the agency's revelation strategy, creating the appearance of ideological conflict with the policymaker.	NA
2023	1782	FT04	Veto Players and Policy Development	Many political institutions use decisionmaking procedures that create veto players, who lack direct decision making authority but have the power to block policy change. We analyze the effect of veto players when policies are developed by actors with divergent policy goals. We first analyze policymaking activity and show that if veto players are moderate then competing groups on both sides develop policies. As veto players become more extreme, activity becomes asymmetric, and one side disengages from policy development. For highly extreme veto players, there's no policy development and gridlock results. We analyze effects on centrists' utiilty. Moderate veto players dampen productive policy competition. But some effects are surprisingly positive. When the status quo benefits a veto player and a skilled policy developer is highly motivated change it, the veto player induces the developer to develop a higher quality proposal, which can be beneficial for centrists as long as the veto player isn’t too extreme. We apply our model to analyze changes in policy development activity in the U.S. Senate and conditions under which centrists choose to maintain the filibuster.	NA
2023	414	FT04	Criminal wars, reputation, enforcement policies and electoral accountability	At least tens of millions live in places controlled by criminal organizations. In these places, state interventions in the form of enforcement policies against organized criminal groups (OCGs) sometimes improve security and, in others, exacerbate violence. While existing explanations of this variation focus only on conditions under which criminal wars can happen due to commitment problems, I propose a dynamic model to understand the effects of these policies when criminal wars occur due to information asymmetries. I then embed the model into a framework of electoral accountability to understand how electoral incentives shape enforcement policies against OCGs. Contrary to the results from existing theories, the state reduces violence by not targeting the most violent criminal groups.	NA
2023	479	FT04	Which Side are You On? Interest Groups and Relational Contracts	This paper studies quid-pro-quo dynamic agreements between an interest group and two political parties. Political parties repeatedly compete for office. Before each election, the interest group decides which party to support. When in power, parties choose the rent they transfer to the interest group to buy its support. Yet, binding agreements are not possible, so agreements must be self-enforcing. When political fluctuations are mild, the interest group favors an opportunistic agreement in which it always supports the current incumbent. As political fluctuations increase, the interest group prefers an exclusive agreement in which it supports a single party even when it is in opposition. An interest group with more inefficient rents is also less likely to favor an opportunistic agreement. The model offers a novel explanation for why studies on the impact of campaign contributions on policymaking find mixed evidence. Besides, my results shed new light on existing empirical findings by showing that interest groups' long-term loyalty does not necessarily imply an ideological alignment, and interest groups' opportunism can be a sign of high-quality institutions.

2023	889	FT04	Signaling via elite-induced referendums	Around the globe, politicians are increasingly choosing to make policy via referendum rather than within the legislature. We show empirically that the occurrence of these “elite-induced” referendums is negatively correlated with societal measures of trust. To provide insights into this relationship, we develop a simple model of politics where a politician faces a popular policy and must choose between calling a referendum or attempting to pass the policy via the legislature. In equilibrium, referendums can be used strategically to either increase or decrease the probability of the policy passing and can signal that the politician is more or less aligned with the voter. Under certain conditions, we show that referendums are called more often when voters believe that politicians are more likely to be misaligned. However, whenever this is the case, the referendum induces inefficient policy distortions: all else equal, voters and the politician who called the referendum would benefit from legislating instead.

2023	1138	PP03	Idiosyncratic economic insecurity and public opposition to fossil-fuel taxes	Why is taxing fossil fuels still faced contentious popular resistance despite the growing climate change awareness among the general population? Agreeing with previous studies on the salience of pocketbook concern while subscribing to the 'insurance' explanation of tax preference, I empirically compare individual economic prospect against one’s current income in terms of their role in pushing public opposition to fossil-fuel taxes. Using the European Social Survey data from 23 countries, I find that the former, which is operationalized as expected income decline or job loss, prevails over the latter in not only substantive effect magnitude but also out-of-sample prediction. My analysis also implies that the underlying mechanism is not sociotropic or other-regarding concern but more likely to be self-interested consideration. Beyond underscoring the temporally misspecified pocketbook concern in the climate policy preference research, this paper also aims at bringing idiosyncratic (in comparison with endogenous/sectoral) economic insecurity into the related literature more.

2023	1186	PP03	Policy acceptance in the presence of policy goals	Given the urgency to decarbonise all areas of human life, multiple policies must be implemented to reduce the chances of irreversible changes to the earth’s climate. These policies need to align with international and domestic climate goals. However, currently, policies are usually discussed and studied to maximize public acceptance at a given time - neglecting the alignment with goals. Our unique preregistered experimental method engages in interdisciplinary research, as we, together with energy modeling experts, co-created policy mixes that align with specific policy goals. Using a novel survey, we study the role goal alignment plays in individual opinion formation about ambitious policy mixes among a large sample of n = 5,655 individuals. Our approach enables us to differentiate between potential mechanisms behind the non-acceptance of policy mixes, namely between citizens who do not want policies that can reach the relevant policy goals and those who do not want to meet the goals. We show that communicating policy goals jointly with policy mixes can significantly increase the public support for ambitious policies, with direct implications for policy makers.	NA
2023	1532	PP10	Walking on thin ice - Mainstream parties and climate legislation	Why do mainstream political parties engage in climate policy reforms? While governments have a crucial role in orchestrating the green transition, parties face little incentive to enact climate policies that impose short-term costs on their supporters. This article explores how mainstream parties use climate policies as a signaling device to position themselves on the issue of the green transition, claim credit and appeal to climate-conscious voters. It also examines the effect of this strategy on policy output. To do so, I analyse five climate reforms enacted in France from 2009 to 2022 by conservative, social-democratic, and centre-right governments. This process-tracing analysis triangulates data from news sources, parliamentary debates, and votes. The preliminary findings are that (1) mainstream parties’ dilemma between attracting climate-conscious voters and alienating their existing constituencies is reinforced by the threat of challenger parties (greens or radical right) contesting their policy choices; (2) they walk this fine line by engaging in blame-avoidance strategies like incrementalism and delay. This paper contributes to the literature on the drivers of climate policy and the effect of party competition on policy change.	NA
2023	203	PP03	Going Quiet - The Politics of the Climate Welfare State	The transition to a carbon-neutral economy has massive distributive consequences, leading to opposition to crucial climate policy among negatively affected groups. Policy-makers increasingly call for and adopt policies that take into account the welfare dimension of climate policy. ‘Climate welfare policy’ aims to address social risks stemming from the transition without holding up the transition itself. This paper makes three contributions to the growing literature on the interface of climate and welfare. First, I offer a conceptualization of (distributive) climate welfare policies, based on which sector (carbon-intensive versus carbon-neutral) and which agent (corporates or individuals) the policy addresses. Second, I propose an analytical framework for climate welfare politics, arguing that the integration of climate and welfare policy changes the politics of the welfare state fundamentally: climate welfare politics goes ‘quiet’. Third, I explore my arguments with empirical evidence from a comparative case study of the implementation of the EU Just Transition Mechanism in three of the most carbon-intensive regions in the EU. Overall, the paper contributes to our understanding of the conditions under which governments invest in the long-term.	NA
2023	954	PP03	Protecting Economic Assets or People? Evidence from Choice Experiments on Climate Adaptation Investment Preferences in Three High-Income Countries	Global warming results in increased risks to economic assets and people, and the larger these risks become the more societies will be forced to prioritise investment in climate change adaptation measures. On the presumption that median voter preferences matter, we use choice experiments in three large economies (US, Japan, Germany) to study preference formation amongst the mass public in this domain. Our experiment focuses on flood risks and exposes study participants to pairs of communities that differ in various ways, including exposure to flood risks, economic vitality, property values and lives at risk, funding aimed at relocating the population versus building protection infrastructure, and the political orientation of the community government. Respondents are asked to allocate a total of $10m between the two communities and also rate them in terms of their deservingness. We are particularly interested in testing hypotheses on trade-offs between community attributes, for example whether the public is more (or less) supportive of climate adaptation investment into communities characterised by more property than people at risk, or whether political orientation biases investment priorities.

2023	128	IP06	The Rise of Zombie Election Monitoring	The international election monitoring regime has become considerably more complex in the twenty-first century. Although the number of inter-governmental organizations (IGOs) and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in high-quality election monitoring has plateaued over time, the number of lower-quality monitors has continued to grow. Now, most prominent authoritarian IGOs engage in election monitoring, as do many other less prominent IGOs and INGOs. In this paper, we develop hypotheses to explain variation in which organizations take up the practice of international election monitoring. We consider factors such as organizations' members, missions, resources, and regions. In addition, we consider how high-quality monitors respond to the activities of low-quality monitors at the elections where both types of groups are present. To test our hypotheses, we draw on new data on international election observation since 2000. Our dataset includes information on what we believe is the largest set of international election monitors, which we categorize as either high, middle, or low quality.	NA
2023	1335	IP06	Mobilising ethnic nationalism: Strategic De-legitimation of international criminal tribunals	International organisations (IOs) require legitimacy to wield authority effectively. While understanding what legitimises IOs in the eyes of political elites has attracted extensive research, recent events challenging IOs has sparked research on ‘backlash’ and delegitimation. International criminal tribunals (ICTs) are among the institutions facing widespread delegitimation. However, we know little about why and how political elites attempt to delegitimise IOs. Addressing this gap, we explore why and through which mechanisms political elites pursue delegitimation. We theorize two possible motivations for elite delegitimation of ICTs, which have distinct observable implications. First, delegitimation may be strategic and pursued to maximise the utility and self-interests of relevant actors, following a logic of consequences. We expect strategic delegitimation to manifest as the mobilization of ethnic nationalism in critiques of ICTs. Second, belief-based delegitimation adheres to a logic of appropriateness and is motivated by normative commitments and will manifest in critiques about procedures and substantive rules. Based on cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, we investigate the causal mechanisms linking elite motivations to acts of delegitimation.	NA
2023	1387	IP06	Long-Arm Deterrence: Judicial Reach and Multinational Corporations in Authoritarian Regimes	Domestic judiciaries help convey state interests and preferences. In this article, we argue that a state's integration into the global governance and economic order incorporates extraterritorial subjects into the set of actors that the domestic judiciary can influence beyond its sovereign boundaries. Therefore, the effect of domestic court proceedings can reach foreign jurisdictions, even if foreign countries do not change their own policies. Specifically, we take advantage of the expansion of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) jurisdiction as an exogenous instrument in limiting multinational corporations' (MNCs) corrupt exchanges with state-owned enterprises in authoritarian regimes. Using a new dataset on MNC lawsuit activities in China, we show that the new legal restraints have a long-arm deterrent effect by decreasing the litigation advantages of MNCs that form joint-venture partnerships with state-owned enterprises. Moreover, by employing a difference-in-differences design, we find that the extraterritorial effect leads to worse investment performance for U.S.-listed firms operating in China's state-dominated sectors. This article advances our understanding of foreign direct investment in authoritarian regimes, MNCs' risk-mitigation strategies, and the interactions between domestic and transnational legal institutions.

2023	1638	IP06	Democracy promotion through trade agreements: What explains the direction and the level of ambition?	Democracy promotion has been an important foreign policy instrument for many democratic states. This paper focuses on how preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have been used as a tool to promote democracy abroad and at home. We introduce a new typology of democracy-related provisions in PTAs and present novel insights from a new database. We then test a number of competing explanations why some PTAs are more ambitious than others and which types of categories of democracy promotion have been advocated, ranging from explicit obligations that advance democratization to more indirect and implicit commitments to strengthen individual rights and norms related to transparency and inclusiveness. We provide evidence that the EU is most ambitious in using PTAs for direct democracy promotion. However, regarding commitments capturing indirect and implicit strategies, other states surface as rule-makers. We also show that PTAs involving new democracies are most likely to embrace both explicit and implicit obligations.	NA
2023	847	IP06	Voting with Putin	What explains why politicians from European liberal democracies have supported Putin on geopolitical questions? Russia has pursued two potentially complementary strategies. First, Russia has offered material incentives to national governments but also to political parties and individual politicians. Second, Putin has increasingly positioned Russia as the ideological defender of traditional values and gender relations in opposition to Western decadence and cultural decay. We analyze several observable implications of these mechanisms using a new dataset on votes in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) between 2007-2021. We focus on resolutions with geopolitical implications for Russia. While the ties between Russia and extreme right-wing parties and former communist parties are well documented, we also find considerable support for Russia's positions among politicians from more mainstream parties. Our initial findings suggest that female parliamentarians and parliamentarians from parties with female leadership are significantly less likely to vote for Russia on geopolitical issues. We find similar evidence for parties that are more supportive of LGBTQ rights. We also find qualitative evidence that Russia has offered material inducements to PACE parliamentarians.	NA
2023	1075	PL15	Playing populist: spatial and ideological determinants of populist rhetoric in the Italian parliament (1948-2020)	This article identifies spatial and ideological motives likely to increase political parties' motivation to use populist rhetoric when framing their claims. We first treat populism as a 'quasi-valence' broad-appealing and vote-winning strategy, likely to be positively evaluated by both left- and right-wing voters. Then, we incorporate the distinction between position and valence issues introduced by Stokes in the downsian spatial framework, and we develop a spatial model that identifies the determinants of populist rhetoric prevalence across parties. Our spatial model predicts populist claim-making to be a function of parties' relative ideological positioning and of the overall degree of polarization of the party system. Indeed, we expect parties to invest more in populist claim-making the more the distance between them and their ideologically adjacent competitors shrinks, and the less the polarization of the party system increases. We find empirical support for our hypotheses by applying a novel populist dictionary to a newly constructed dataset on parliamentary debates that spans the entire Italian Republican history (1948-2020).

2023	1454	PL15	Feeling Represented: Government Composition and Populist Attitudes	When do citizens become less populist? As populism encompasses a critique of political representation, we argue that populist attitudes decrease when voters feel that their voices are being heard. Based on this argument, we provide a causal analysis of how changes in government composition affects voters’ levels of populist attitudes relying on high quality panel data from Austria and Germany. Our findings provide strong evidence in favor of this argument: partisans strongly react to their preferred party’s change in government status. Moreover, the decrease in populist attitudes appears to be long-lasting, as populist attitudes do not completely rebound to pre-government participation levels when a party goes back into opposition. These results have important implications for the study of populism and representative democracy.	NA
2023	1683	PL15	How has Parliamentary Populism in Switzerland evolved over time? Evidence from the Swiss parliamentary speeches spanning 130 years.	How can we measure parliamentary populism over time? Members of parliament debate and voice their option, and elements of populism within their speeches might not be uncommon, not even in such a closed setting. Our paper makes two main contributions. 1) we develop a new computational measure for populist expressions, and 2) we study this measure on a newly compiled dataset of parliamentary speeches spanning back to 1891. Our measure of populist expressions is built on previous research that uses dictionaries to identify populist speakers. Rather than focusing on singular words (from word-lists), however, we examine triples, e.g., disentangling subjects, predicates and objects. Furthermore, we rely on semantic role labeling and coreference resolution for correctly allocating meaning to non-descriptive words (such as 'we' or 'they' in previous sentences). In our paper we discuss how parliamentary populism has developed over time and how methods for automatic detection of populist sentiments in texts can be improved.	NA
2023	1775	PL15	Who Votes for Populists in Latin America? It Depends Upon if the Populist is the President	Voters are expected to support populists because distrust of state institutions and dissatisfaction with democracy convinces them that populists’ claims about conspiratorial elites are valid. However, most work testing these propositions studies regions and eras when populists are not governing. We propose these dynamics change when populists govern; once they command the institutions, sustained support becomes precisely contingent upon trust in the new institutional order. We use recently collected expert-survey data from Latin America that codes levels of populism at the party level to model vote intentions for populist parties inside and outside of government. Support for populist parties who do not control the presidency is consistent with prior work: individuals who have low levels of trust in state institutions are more likely to support populist challenger parties than non-populist parties, regardless of who is in office. However, support for populist presidents is higher among those who trust state institutions or who believe that the state is performing well. While democratic deficits and poor governance provide openings for populists, they are held accountable for whether they can improve democratic quality.	NA
2023	972	PL15	Polarized, but how? Positional and non-positional foundations of polarization in parliamentary speech	The expression of conflict and compromise are central to the functioning of representative democratic institutions, especially in parliamentary debate. Several innovations in text-as-data methods enable insights into long-term trends of parliamentary polarization (Jensen et al., 2012; Lauderdale & Herzog, 2016; Peterson & Spirling, 2018). Yet, we know relatively little about the concrete rhetorical patterns in which polarization manifests in political speech. Our study aims at closing this gap by disentangling the positional and non-positional foundations of polarization in parliamentary speech. We conduct a comparative quantitative content analysis of parliamentary speech in historical and political contexts where aggregate-level measurements obtained with text-based machine learning methods indicate different levels of polarization. Our analyses demonstrate that in addition to policy-centered statements about legislators' stances and priorities, polarization often manifests in non-positional rhetoric that involves criticism and appraisal of actors' valence attributes. We conclude that conceptions and measurement strategies that focus exclusively on policy-centered conflict are insufficient to capture the multifaceted nature of parliamentary polarization. Our findings have implications for the quantitative, text-based study of polarization and our understanding of the working of representative democracy.	NA
2023	1259	PL16	Changing the formula: Between-party seat allocation and counterfactual representation in the European Parliament	The aim of proportional representation (PR) is simple: allocating seat shares in proportion to vote shares. The difficult question is how to achieve it in practice.While recent elections to the European Parliament (EP) have applied PR in all member states, the specific implementation is hugely variable. This does not only concern the within-party dimension but also the formula for between-party allocation. Notably, many member states continue to use d’Hondt, which is well-known to be less proportional than some other methods and to favour larger parties over smaller ones. This paper examines how counterfactually changing the PR formula would have altered the composition of the EP and its policy decisions. Taking observed voting results as given, I simulate counterfactual EPs, both with regard to composition (party ideology, number of women) and decision-making (roll-call votes). Data come from COMEPELDA and VoteWatch. The analyses, focusing on the fifth to ninth EP, show that changing the formula could lead to EPs that are notably different. The specific direction of the effects varies across elections, depending on the type of small parties doing well.	NA
2023	1372	EU11	Position Formation in the European Parliament: The Role of Inter- and Intra-Institutional Dynamics	Legislative outcomes in bicameral legislatures, such as the European Union (EU), are shaped by the positions of the co-legislating institutions. Yet, how can we explain how these institutions position themselves in the legislative process? In this paper, I explore the factors that influence position formation in the European Parliament (EP). Specifically, the paper examines how the structure of inter-institutional negotiations, intra-institutional conflict and transaction costs, as well as the Commission's predictive ability, shape the EP's incentives to deviate from the Commission proposal. Using an automated technique to create full length legal texts from amendments, I assess the relationship between these characteristics of the legislative process and the distance between the EP report and the original Commission proposal in more than 3,000 co-decision and consultation procedures. The findings have implications for how we view inter-institutional bargaining in the EU and legislative position formation in bicameral legislatures. Furthermore, the technique used to create full length texts from proposal amendments has potential use in text-based EU legislative research employing hypothetical bills to represent individual and institutional level actor positions.

2023	1797	PL16	Defection and Emotive Rhetoric - Analysing Votes and Debates in the European Parliament Using Large-Language Models and Text Matching	Defections from the party line are often perceived as costly for legislators. Recent research, however, has shown that under certain circumstances, voters value defection and that legislators strategically employ emotive rhetoric to appeal to voters. This paper builds on these findings, arguing that legislators who vote against the party majority use more emotive language than their loyal colleagues to increase support for their position. Drawing on an original data set consisting of a multilingual corpus of debates and related roll call votes from the 8th and 9th European Parliament (2014-2022), I use a multilingual transformer-based large language model (XLM-RoBERTa) combined with active learning to classify the emotionality of the speeches. Adopting a text matching strategy to obtain credible estimates of the effects of defection on rhetoric, the preliminary findings suggest differences in the degree of emotive language depending on the voting decision. The findings will contribute to our understanding of how legislators communicate intra-party disagreements and why they defect from their party principals, with implications for political representation.

2023	488	PL16	Building Castles Made of Sand? The Impact of Domestic Issue Dispersion on EP Party Unity	Does national-level issue dispersion predict the national party delegations unity in the European Parliament (EP)? Scholars find that disperse issue-level preferences within parties can have a detrimental impact on party’s electability. Fractionalization, within governing parties results in mixed messages to voters over a parties’ issue positions and their viability to hold office or oversee policy-making. These effects can reach beyond the national sphere. We propose that diverse preferences within parties on policy-issues springboard from domestic debates to playout cross-nationally in the EP. As we see more diversity of preferences on salient issues at the national level, we predict these debates will be further amplified within the EP. In effect, voter and elite salience predicts the degree of dispersion within party delegations. To test our argument, we use a multilingual, semi-supervised machine learning approach to scale party issue preferences using the ParlEE Plenary Speeches dataset. The results of this analysis hold implications for theories of parliamentary agenda formation in multilevel settings. Our findings provide theories of national-level debate and disagreement with a key mechanism for influencing the EP policy-making process.	NA
2023	1190	EU11	When all votes were recorded – An empirical assessment of selection bias in scaled preferences and party cohesion scores in the European Parliament	Rollcall votes are commonly used to scale preferences of individual legislators and to compute party cohesion scores. One major difficulty is that rollcall votes may be requested for strategic reasons and that this might affect voting behaviour and, therefore, the validity of scaled preference estimates and party cohesion scores. From April 2020 to March 2022 – during the ninth European Parliament – all voting was recorded to allow Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to verify their vote choices during the Covid pandemic. During this time, more votes were taken by rollcall than during the previous legislative term – 13,520 compared to 10,505. We compare scaled preference estimates and cohesion scores from the period when all votes were recorded to the same estimates using data from the remainder of the ninth European Parliament and estimates from the previous legislative term. This setup allows us to empirically test how severely scaled preference estimates and cohesion scores are affected by a selection bias in rollcall voting in the European Parliament. We contribute to a large literature on the representativeness of rollcall votes.	NA
2023	1192	EU11	Explaining Roll Call Requests in the European Parliament	Why do the leaders of political groups in the European Parliament request roll calls on some amendments but not on others? Is it disciplining? To ensure that their backbenchers vote as instructed, that their voting-coalition partner deliver on their words? Or is it signalling? To ensure that supporters, new outlets, national party leaders, and interest groups notice that they stood up for their principles where other faltered? Drawing on detailed data from 2004 to 2022, we show that the rationale for requesting roll calls vary across groups and over time. While the two largest political group seem to use roll call requests for disciplining purposes, other political group are less focused on discipling than signalling, or even disruption. Recent changes in to Rules of Procedure to limit the scope for using roll calls for disruptive purposes have only to some extent prevented, in particular right-wing Euro-sceptics, from employing such tactics.

2023	88	EU11	Leveraging politicization? Council responsiveness to public opinion in legislative negotiations.	This paper examines whether or to what extent domestic politics in the EU member states affects the negotiating positions of the Council of Ministers. We posit that the Council adapts its negotiating stance to changes in the public mood across the member states. As the citizens become more skeptical of EU action in a policy domain, the Council's position becomes less prone to increase EU authority. In this way, the Council helps member state governments avoid the costs of domestic public scrutiny. We expect that this effect is amplified when the public has a united voice and treats the EU action in a policy area as a salient matter. Similarly, the Council position is more responsive to the member states led by Europhile governments as they tend to form the winning coalitions during policy-making. Using semi-supervised machine learning, we construct a novel dataset estimating EU authority expansion encapsulated in the Council negotiation positions at the first trilogue. We rely on the Eurobarometer and MARPOR indicators to measure public opinion and governments’ positions on EU action across policy areas, respectively.	NA
2023	1581	IR11	Electoral Politics, Election Proximity, and Sanction Success	How do elections affect sanction effectiveness? Are sanctioned states who face election in the near future more or less likely to acquaise to the demands of the sanctioning states? While the effects of elections have been extensively examined in the context of military conflicts, its possible effect on sanction effectiveness has not been subject to systematic scrutiny. We hypothesize that target governments are more likely to comply with sender demands as the elections loom near. We argue that they do so to avoid the likely political costs of economic hardships triggered by sanctions. We assess the empirical merits of this claim using data on over 1,000 sanction cases between 1950-2020. Results support our hypothesis. We also find that the effect of election proximity is more prominent in less democratic states that hold competitive elections. This suggests that even if sanctions have a relatively low success rate against nondemocratic polities as suggested in the literature, elections may provide a window of opportunity for the senders to extract concessions from the target	NA
2023	227	IP12	Baptists and Bootleggers in Trade Politics: How Treaty Recognition Makes Side Agreements Credible	Studies show that liberalizing governments include social and environmental clauses in trade agreements to gain pro-trade support from activists. However, these studies do not address how the government makes issue linkage credible to activists, who understand that the government has weak incentives to enforce such linkages once the agreement is ratified. How do liberalizing governments make issue linkage credible to activists despite the commitment problem? Focusing on U.S. government decisions regarding environmental clauses in trade agreements, I argue that a liberalizing government uses international treaties to mitigate activists' fears of defection. By recognizing environmental international organizations' authority in trade agreements, the government can mitigate activists' fear of defection and increase their support for trade agreements. Using original data, I find that the government recognized environmental treaties with more ties to U.S.-based activists in designing environmental clauses in trade agreements. Based on a comparative case study and text analysis of novel meeting records, I also show that activists with ties to seven recognized treaties supported issue linkage whereas those without ties to the treaties joined forces with anti-trade groups.

2023	272	IP03	Ideology and states’ commitment to multilateralism	Existing literature argues that the left is generally more supportive of multilateralism in foreign policy than the right. However, the impact of ideology on states’ commitment to multilateralism have not been adequately empirically tested yet. We assess the presence of a left-right divide on this issue on a new dataset, containing information about the ratification of all multilateral treaties listed in the United Nations Treaty Collection (UNTC) from 1945. Our results indicate that indeed countries led by left-wing executives/leaders are faster at ratifying treaties than those led by right-wing executives/leaders. The impact of ideology is more evident for democracies than autocracies and during the Cold War than in its aftermath. We also find that external pressure from other states reduces the gap between left and right. Through such findings, the article provides a valuable contribution to the debate over the impact of ideology on international relations and drivers of global support for multilateralism.	NA
2023	346	IP12	Lessons from the past: governing global trade in the postwar scenario (1947-1971)	Institutional complexity, whereby policy domains are increasingly governed by several diverse and overlapping actors, is often portrayed as a recent phenomenon only. However, even largely hierarchical domains have often witnessed enduring contestation of their focal organizations. The paper focuses on the postwar trade domain, initially centered around the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). By drawing on new theoretical insights, it displays how institutional complexity has been a defining feature of this domain, with GATT’s leadership being progressively challenged by new actors. The paper offers two contributions. First, it shows how the GATT countered external institutional threats by modulating its responses on the characteristics of the challenge faced. Second, it unearths the many actors participating in the governance of trade in the postwar years, including the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). By showing how these actors compensated for distinct GATT’s weaknesses, the paper highlights their role in furthering a legitimation of the postwar trade domain and filling existing gaps.	NA
2023	948	IP12	More sanctions, but less effective? Super- vs. self-imposed sanctions in international organizations	Sanctions by organizations of states have been shown to be more effective than unilateral sanctions. But we do not know what determines the comparative effectiveness of organizational sanctions. For the European Union, disagreements on the optimal scope of sanctions on Russia in 2022 have sparked a debate on the pros and cons of unanimity voting. I argue that the fundamental determinant of the effectiveness of organizational sanctions are its decision-making rules, specifically the degree to which all states can influence the decision to impose sanctions. If the sanctions are super-imposed on a state, it is less likely to enforce the organisational sanction and therefore the success probability of the sanction decreases. The comparative analysis, based on 311 cases imposed by international organizations in the period from 1950 to 2019, confirms this hypothesis. I combine self-coded data on the decision-making rules of sanction-imposing organizations with data on the enforcement and effectiveness of sanctions. My findings imply that, while the EU might be able to impose more sanctions with a different decision-making mechanism, its sanctions would become less effective.	NA
2023	121	PP01	Red Tape & Refugees: Administrative Barriers to Welfare State Access for Refugees in Germany	Refugees in Germany face bureaucratic barriers to social benefits access that natives and even other immigrants do not. Administrative burdens may include learning costs, process costs, and psychological costs that all come with learning about, applying for, and receiving public services (Herd & Moynihan, 2019). More specifically, racialized burdens are practices in public administration that reinforce patterns of unequal access to services (Ray et al., 2022). The purpose of this paper is to analyze administrative burdens faced by refugees when accessing the German welfare state and to assess the role of policy in creating or minimizing burdens. Through semi-structured interviews with refugees, I compare the administrative challenges faced by respondents from different nationalities. Preliminary findings indicate systematic disparities in administrative burdens by nationality. Variation in asylum case processes can delay or limit access to social benefits for individuals from less-common refugee-sending countries. Supports to assist refugees in navigating bureaucracy – such as translation – vary between welfare offices as well as between nationalities. This paper contributes to scholarship on racialized burdens by examining policy-created variation in access to the welfare state.	NA
2023	1344	PP01	How shared accommodation affects structural and social integration of refugees – Quasi-experimental evidence from Germany	In many countries, asylum seekers are initially housed in shared accommodation centers. However, the incidence of shared versus private accommodation substantially varies both across and within countries, e.g. due to distinct administrative practices or regional contexts. This is very relevant from a policy perspective, since the first years after settling are often seen as crucial for long-term integration trajectories. In this study, we exhaust both regional and intra-individual variation in the length that refugees spend in shared accommodations in Germany (2016–2020) and provide evidence for the effects on key-integration dimensions (employment, social contacts and language skills). We use both fine-grained administrative data and high-quality survey-panel data and implement two complementary identification-strategies. First, we match districts with comparable structural contexts but different lengths of stays in shared accommodation to obtain macroscopic estimates of the effect of different housing practices. Second, we take an individual perspective by implementing a staggered difference-in-difference approach, comparing refugees who are observed to move from shared into private accommodations versus refugees staying in shared accommodation at the same time.

2023	1406	PP01	Negative and less profound? The linguistic and judicial complexity of German asylum appeal adjudication	Various studies have shown for several European countries that decision-making on asylum applications exhibits considerable inequities. However, there is little research on whether appeals on negative first-instance decisions are able to limit the discriminatory potential of the first decision-making stage. To close this gap, we conduct a study on the argumentative style in several thousand judgements that German administrative courts published between 2010 and 2018. Based on the judicial politics literature, we expect that the costs for asylum seekers are much larger in making their case than for the federal authorities. This increases the risk that the judicial reasoning on negative appeal decisions is less complex. Using computational text analysis, we examine the complexity of the judgements along two dimensions. First, we analyse the linguistic complexity of opinions by relying on several measures of language usage. Second, we examine the legal complexity of opinions by referring to precedent decisions and academic sources. While controlling for case and court characteristics, our analysis supports the conjecture that rejected appeals are less complex both on the linguistic and legalistic dimension of complexity.	NA
2023	1054	M09	The Statistical Power of Staggered Difference-in-Differences Estimators in Small Samples	Two-way fixed effects is a biased estimator in difference-in-differences designs with staggered treatment timing and time-varying effect sizes. A large number of estimators has been proposed to remedy this. However, there exists little guidance for applied researchers as to when to use which of these new estimators. We use simulations to study the power of recently developed difference-in-differences estimators in a small sample setting similar to the US States. We show that even in generous scenarios, most estimators require very large effect sizes to be well-powered. Low power has important consequences: When effect sizes are small, the statistically significant estimates retrieved by the lowest powered estimators have the wrong sign in up to 6\% of the time, and over-estimate the true effect three-fold on average. However, some estimators are better powered, and do not exhibit the same errors of sign and magnitude. Our results suggest that, due to power concerns in small samples, researchers may be better off applying estimators with less credible identifying assumptions.	NA
2023	1287	M09	Let the Uncertainty Guide You: A Robustness Test for the Polynomial Order Choice in Regression Discontinuity Designs	In regression discontinuity designs, researchers often conduct robustness tests with ad hoc chosen polynomial orders. This is problematic because some polynomial orders fit the data poorly, such that researchers compare the main polynomial order to an implausible, alternative specification. Moreover, it gives researchers the possibility to only show estimates that demonstrate robustness. This paper proposes a robustness test based on a plausibility criterion. It constructs bootstrapped confidence intervals around the differences in asymptotic mean squared errors, a measure of fit commonly used in regression discontinuity papers to find the optimal specification. Using the confidence intervals, researchers can make a statistical comparison of the fit of different polynomial orders and identify which are equally plausible. By incorporating the uncertainty around the measure of fit, the robustness test also improves upon single-polynomial methods, which risk discarding relevant alternative estimates. This paper's empirical section first conducts a replication analysis which confirms that estimates in published regression discontinuity analyses are frequently sensitive to the polynomial order choice. Second, application to three regression discontinuity analyses shows how the proposed robustness test aids inference in practice.	NA
2023	750	M09	Political Solidarities in Novaland: Can we Simulate the Experience of States, Economies and Public Policies in a Virtual Online State?	What if we could experimentally manipulate characteristics of states, economies and policies and estimate their effects on citizens? This study presents evidence from Novaland, a virtual online democracy with characteristics drawn from German and Romanian welfare states (e.g., level of welfare and corruption). The study consists of an text- and image-based online platform where participants are randomly assigned to different experiences (e.g., income, corruption or unemployment), interact with each other and co-create decisions (e.g., elections and donations) that determine the course of Novaland. For this purpose, we recruited participants via social media networks (N = 347) and collected data in November 2022, which was funded by the European Research Council (ERC). Our results are: (1) The Novaland Experience worked technically well with over 300 participants interacting simultaneously. (2) Participants behaved in an internally valid manner, although there were signs of inattentiveness. (3) Volunteers' political ideology was reflected in their Novaland behaviour, whereas socio-demographic characteristics showed no effects. Novaland offers the blueprint for innovative political science research on state characteristics and people’s political solidarities.	NA
2023	813	PC21	And This is Why: Automated Extraction of Causal Arguments in Political Text	Narratives are the main means by which humans organize, process and communicate information (Jones & McBeth, 2010). For politics, narratives shape beliefs and present versions of political reality. Analyzing narratives is usually limited to small-N studies and are subject to researchers’ interpretation. However, because narratives have an underlying structure, computational tools can be used for their systematic analysis. Previous research has experimented with language models to predict characters in narratives, as well as extracting the timeline of the stories (Caselli et al., 2021; Stammbach et al., 2022). We propose accessing narratives via their causal arguments. Based on previous work on causality extraction models, we designed a method to extract causal arguments from political texts: we annotated the causal structure of 8,000 sentences, then used a Pretrained RoBERTa for the binary classification task, and then extracted the cause-effect pairs in the text. The binary classification model achieved an F1-score of 0.84. For political communication, this method has the potential of automating and systematizing causal arguments, which can then be used for inferences about how politicians construct narratives.	NA
2023	866	M09	From ideal experiments to ideal research designs (IDRs): What they are and why we should use them more	It is often recommended to investigate causal research questions by considering an ideal experiment. An ideal experiment describes the study a researcher would carry out if there weren't practical, ethical, or resource-related constraints (e.g., Angrist and Pischke 2008). First, we review whether and how methodologists define and advocate using ideal experiments (IEs). Second, we introduce the more general notion of ideal research designs (IRDs), discuss their components, and contrast them with actual research designs (ARDs). IRDs go beyond IEs in that they also speak to issues such as measurement errors that are rarely the focus of IEs. Third, we provide examples of what IRDs and ARDs may look like for particular descriptive and causal research questions, highlighting the various components of an IRD. Finally, we introduce research design graphs (RDGs) which may be used to visualize and compare some essential components of IRDs/ARDs. Fourth, departing from our systematic account, we review applied examples of whether and how researchers have used IEs and IRDs in applied empirical research.	NA
2023	1027	M08	Automatic Dictionary Creation for Political Text Analysis: Introducing A Versatile and Efficient Approach	Social scientists use dictionaries to solve various text-as-data tasks like classifying parliamentary questions according to broadly used coding-schemes or to determine sentiment of tweets. Such approaches for automated text classification are particularly useful when the classification task cannot be achieved through manual coding and when hand-coded material is not available for training a classifier. So far, researchers rely primarily on manually curated keyword lists to build such dictionaries. In addition to being a resource-intensive process, the validity of the resulting word lists is at times doubtful. We propose a ressource-efficient alternative approach that automatically generates suitable keywords from political texts and can be adjusted to various research interests. We determine the most impactful words per topic via a voting model using three different metrics of word impact per topic. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by creating dictionaries to measure the issue salience of manifestos according to the Comparative Agenda Project’s coding scheme for Germany and the United Kingdom. Our results show high face validity and are comparable to similar issue salience measures from the MARPOR Project.	NA
2023	1793	M08	Validating the text-to-measure pipeline: A procedure-based approach to creating measures of latent concepts with supervised machine learning	Researchers in political science increasingly need to measure important latent concepts represented within text collections that are far too numerous to be human labeled. A particularly attractive approach in this setting is supervised machine learning, which involves scoring a subset of the corpus on the latent trait, training a model based on the labeled data, and then imputing scores for the larger document set. However, each of these steps comes with its own set of potential pitfalls, and the cumulative process can seem confusing or convoluted to researchers and readers alike. In this paper, we provide a conceptual overview for each step in the process of using supervised learners to measure traits in text beginning with subsetting the corpus and ending with measurement validation. For each stage, we discuss some of the important issues that researchers should consider and provide a framework to help conceptualizing the aggregate procedure. We illustrate our argument by developing and validating a measure of tone in questions asked of nominees to federal office during US Senate confirmation hearings from 1997-2019.	NA
2023	1932	M08	Named-Entity Recognition with Application to Foreign Leader Mentions in Congressional Speeches	We introduce Named-Entity Recognition (NER), a semantic tool in Natural Language Processing (NLP), as an approach to extract leader names from a corpus of political text. Identifying references to named entities allows us to use the significant power of text analysis to advance research on how and why these entities matter. We offer insight into non-trivial issues of recognizing political leaders' mentions in political text, these include variations in name spelling and disambiguation of transliterated names. We offer an algorithm for identifying and disambiguating leader names and software to help researchers perform this task on political text. As an illustration of our approach, we look at the Congressional record. We identify mentions of political leaders running in foreign elections- incumbent leaders and main opposition candidates. We show that Congressional mentions of foreign leaders reflect the positions foreign leaders assume on relations with the U.S., and convey an interest in supporting candidates and democracy. This confirms and extends existing research while demonstrating the utility of using NER in political science research more generally.	NA
2023	212	M08	How to Train Your Stochastic Parrot: Large Language Models for Political Texts	Large language models pre-trained on massive corpora of text from the Internet have transformed the way that computer scientists approach natural language processing over the past five years. But these “foundation models” have yet to see widespread adoption in the social sciences, partly due to their novelty and upfront costs. In this paper, we demonstrate that such models can be effectively applied to a wide variety of text-as-data tasks in political science – including sentiment analysis, ideological scaling, and topic modeling. In a series of pre-registered analyses, this approach outperforms conventional supervised learning methods without the need for extensive data pre-processing or large sets of labeled training data. And performance is comparable to expert and crowd-coding methods at a fraction of the cost. We explore the accuracy-cost tradeoff associated with adding more model parameters, and discuss how best to adapt and validate the models for particular applications.	NA
2023	1480	EU13	The National Recovery and Resilience Plans: towards a next generation of fiscal coordination?	The EU's poor past track record of economic crisis management is challenged by the Next Generation EU (NGEU) and its main instrument: the Recovery and Resilience facility (RRF), which supposedly innovates the governance framework regarding one of the original sins of the EMU architecture – economic coordination. We assess whether the RRF is indeed an effective mechanism for fiscal policy coordination among EU member states by examining whether functional pressures trump national priorities in the national recovery plans (NRRPs) and assessing whether the NRRPs reflect policy change toward the common priorities of NGEU. Using automated text analysis, we assess the saliency of green, digital and social priorities in (i) the recovery plans, (ii) the policy agenda of member state governments and (iii) the investment and reform agenda advocated by the 2019 Country Specific Recommendations. We provide preliminary evidence of limited economic policy coordination through the NRRPs. Our paper contributes to the timely assessment of how the pandemic recovery instruments have innovated the EMU architecture and, more generally, to the debate on reforming the EU fiscal framework.	NA
2023	1967	EU13	Communicating EU regional policy: How territoriality affects media framing	This paper investigates the determinants of valence in the media framing of cohesion(regional) policy - the European Union's (EU) largest investment policy for economic development projects at national, regional and local levels. We develop novel hypotheses concerning the direct and moderating impact of the territorial proximity of media outlets on the valence of news stories. The key argument is that subnational media outlets are more likely to frame cohesion policy stories positively compared to national media because of the territorial proximity (closeness) of subnational media outlets to target audiences and their everyday lives on the ground, especially when stories adopt a socio-economic consequences frame and EU actors are attributed responsibility for policy consequences. A mixed effects regression analysis on an original dataset from nine EU countries provides support for our expectations. Theoretical and policy implications are also discussed.	NA
2023	2049	2049	Explaining Support for European Solidarity: Comparing citizens support for EU Cohesion Policy across regions	What preferences do European citizens have for EU solidarity through Cohesion Policy? While existing research focuses on EU solidarity through fiscal instruments and migration policies, we know less about people's views concerning the largest and most redistributive EU investment policy. Drawing on an original survey of over 8,500 citizens, we investigate citizen preferences for different models of Cohesion Policy redistribution at the regional level. We find that there is very little support for the termination (or nationalisation) of EU Cohesion Policy, even in rich regions in net contributor countries. Citizens show strong support for the current ‘all region’ model of regional policy and, to a more limited extent, a more concentrated model focused exclusively on the poorest EU regions. We find that the key determinants of support for solidarity include perceived benefits, ideology and attitudes towards EU. However, solidarity is driven by different mechanisms depending on whether the region is located in a net financial beneficiary or contributor country. These findings have important implications for research on public preferences for EU solidarity and public support for fiscal redistribution more generally.	NA
2023	801	EU13	Who is in charge? Explaining the European Union’s changing implementation design through a machine-learning application to the syntactic structure of EU laws	Over the past thirty years, the implementation of European Union (EU) laws has become increasingly complex as far as the actors participating in the policy process are concerned. On the one side, EU legislators have created a plethora of new supranational agencies with specific implementation prerogatives, both at the national and supranational levels. On the other side, they have increasingly relied on specific competent authorities for implementation at the national level. How can we explain these choices? Why do legislators rely on such agencies and competent authorities? Which benefits, risks and incentives are associated with these decisions? In this paper, we subject to empirical corroboration a set of expectations that flesh out the rationale behind these choices. We also develop an innovative measure of implementation design which is valid and easily scalable to large amounts of data and represents a clear advantage over manual coding. The measure applies machine learning to the syntactic structure of more than 9,000 secondary EU laws adopted between 1958 and 2019.	NA
2023	1020	PL03	Friend or Foe? The Relationship between Coalition Partners over the Legislative Period	What influences the relationship between parties in a coalition government, and how does that relationship change during the legislative cycle? I argue that time and critical events influence the position of individual coalition parties in parliament. After government formation, there is a brief period where all coalition parties have a common ground. However, the longer parties govern together, the more dissimilar they become. There are further low-points before general and even second-order elections, and during economic and military crises. I use data from the ParlSpeech V2 data set, which contains all speeches in legislative chambers in six European parliaments with coalition governments between 1987 and 2019. In order to test this theory, I use wordfish and cosine similarity to determine position, unity and similarity of all coalition partners. This paper offers new insights into how parties in coalition governments behave, and what determines their relationship to each other, which has a direct influence on government output.	NA
2023	1187	PL04	Much ado about nothing: Democracies are immune to governments of election losers	Democracies have been succinctly defined as systems in which parties lose elections: incumbents defeated at the polls are replaced by other rulers that have won elections. However, parties that lose elections often reach office and parties that win do not. If this is such a core feature of democratic systems, are they compromised when election losers rule and winners are left out? To answer this question we focus on close local elections in Spain through a fuzzy RDD comparing contexts where the median party narrowly loses elections in which the likelihood that the plurality winner is out of government is much higher than when the median narrowly wins. We find that democracies seem to be immune to governments of election losers: no effect on turnout, fragmentation, incumbent results, or support for the far right is found. The implications of these findings are profound: they clash with the importance given in democracies to winning elections, but are also good news for parliamentary systems, where the governments require the support of majorities that go above and beyond who is the plurality winner.

2023	1413	PL03	Policy as a Bargaining Outcome: Coalition Leverage and Pledge Fulfillment	We employ a recently constructed empirical measure of party bargaining leverage -- coalition inclusion probabilities -- to test a coalition bargaining explanation of policy outcomes more common to formal theoretical models of policy-making. Theorists have long claimed, but never systematically tested, that actors who can exploit their own and other parties’ coalition options are better able to realize their policy goals. We offer the first empirical test of this central prediction of legislative bargaining models on a broad measure of policy outputs: the fulfillment of parties' campaign pledges. Results in both multiple regression and regression discontinuity analyses show that parties that can credibly threaten to install an alternative government, implement a higher proportion of their policy pledges. Parties' vote shares and seat shares, in contrast, only influence policy outcomes insofar as they capture parties bargaining leverage. We argue that the coalition-bargaining analysis of policy-making offers a novel and useful complement to extant methods of empirical policy analysis that most often explain policy stability rather than specific policy outcomes.

2023	176	PL03	Party Conflict and Coalition Control in Parliament	In this paper, we analyze conflict in the Norwegian parliament to show that MPs use non-legislative arenas of parliament to monitor coalition partner ministers. Where previous studies have relied on implicit assumptions of all questions being negative and using question counts as a conflict magnitude measure, we use the sentiment of the question to measure conflict between opposition, coalition partners, and within party. Our results contradicts the general findings from the literature showing that the MP to minister relation is irrelevant for question conflict. If anything, MPs are more negative when asking questions to ministers of their own party than when asking questions to coalition partner ministers or when MPs are in the opposition.	NA
2023	667	PL04	The audience of coalition bargaining: Voter reactions to different distributional outcomes	Obtaining portfolios is one of the most important payoffs that parties can receive from getting into office. Previous research has mainly focused on how portfolios are distributed between parties, but we know surprisingly little about whether and how voters react to these distributional outcomes. This paper addresses the gap in the literature both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we argue that voters rely on the qualitative and quantitative portfolio distribution in order to judge how successful parties were in coalition negotiations. More specifically, we hypothesize that the number, the power and the party-specific salience of portfolios shape voters perceptions of how competent a party handled the coalition negotiations. Empirically, we rely on a survey experiment fielded ahead of the 2022 Danish election -- a context with unique opportunities for testing the hypotheses. We find support for the notion that both quantitative and qualitative portfolio allocation matters for voters' evaluation of the parties' negotiation skills. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how voters' develop their perceptions of party performance.	NA
2023	1200	PC02	Victims and perpetrators of online political hostility -- Experimental and observational survey data from 30 countries	What drives the hostility of political discussions on social media? According to a dominant narrative, features of online interfaces such as anonymity, conversations one cannot escape, and distraction are the main culprits. Yet, the evidence supporting this popular theory is surprisingly thin, and constrained to a few Western countries. Here, we deploy an ambitious research program surveying 30 diverse countries (N=15,000) to test an alternative account that political hostility is primarily the product of status-seeking and lonely individuals, who are equally predisposed to toxicity online and in face-to-face discussions. We also examine which macro-level indicators best predict politically hostile behavior across the globe. We predict that more economically unequal, more poor, and less democratic countries are experiencing more online political hostility. Third, our investigation explores the reception side, by asking which demographic groups are the most frequent targets of online political hostility. The paper provides the first global, comparative assessment of online political hostility, and should offer important implications for stakeholders seeking to make online political discussions more civic, constructive, and fruitful.

2023	1265	PC02	Misogyny, Politics and social media – Determinants of hostile Engagement against female Parliamentarians on Twitter	Social media offers challenges and opportunities for women, particularly for female politicians. While direct communication with citizens without the intermediary of traditional media gives women the opportunity to present themselves exactly in the way they want to be seen, they are also far more exposed and subject to impoliteness, incivility and online abuse. However, politicians often choose to engage in more conflictive discourses than regular citizens. We suggest that if female politicians choose to use critical or insulting language are subject to disproportionally more backlash than male politicians who choose to do the same. We test our hypothesis by training a transformer model on more than 12,000 Twitter comments annotated for Criticism and Insults. We find that both female and male MPs who use critical language in their Tweets are criticized more by their followers in some parties, we do not find evidence for a backlash against female MPs using more insulting language.

Are Republicans or Democrats more likely to send uncivil messageson social media? Despite widespread concern and extensive anecdotal evidence, welack systematic causal evidence of the extent that gender and partisanship affect toxicbehavior online. Our paper presents a field experiment where we examine the effectsof gender on exposure to incivility online, and whether partisans differentially senduncivil messages on social media. Our field experiment enables us to (1) estimate theeffects of gender on exposure to incivility in a real-world scenario, providing the firstevidence of the magnitude of differences in exposure to incivility caused by social mediausers’ gender, and (2) investigate whether Republicans or Democrats are more likelyto respond with uncivil behavior to the people who respond to them. The results, wehope, will have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of the personal costsof engaging in political debate and discussion on social media, and in our contemporaryonline political world more generally.

2023	898	PC02	The Sources and Consequences of Online Political Toxicity. Evidence from a Multi-Party Context	Social media have become an important channel for direct interaction between citizens and politicians. However, representatives are increasingly subject to insults, threats, and general incivility when doing politics online. What are the sources and the consequences of online political toxicity? This paper presents novel empirical evidence beyond the Anglophone context. Drawing on a full sample of candidates’ campaign activities on Twitter in the 2021 German national election, it analyses citizen-candidate toxicity in over 13,000 Twitter conversations (comprising over 800,000 single tweets). First, using logistic mixed effect models, I show how the amount and type of online toxicity vary by candidate characteristics as well as over citizen ids. While men and candidates running for government parties are more frequently targeted, most variation in toxicity is located on the respondent (citizen) level. Second, the paper utilizes a difference-in-differences design to measure toxicity's consequences. The findings suggest that candidates who are subject to severe toxicity reduce their tweet activity by about 15% in the following days. This is an indication that toxicity might threaten citizen-politician dialogue online, and, thereby, effective political representation.	NA

In this context, counterspeech has gained popularity as a tool that users can use to confront and reduce online hostility. Yet, experimental evidence on its effectiveness is still scarce. Informed by theories from social psychology about empathy-based approaches to reduce intergroup prejudice, we design and test strategies employing traditional perspective-taking, analogical perspective-taking, and perspective-getting. By randomizing these counterspeech strategies across a sample of 2,012 recently sent racist messages from US-based Twitter users, we find that compared to a passive control group, the pooled empathy-based strategies increase the propensity that the user deletes their xenophobic message by 70% (a 3.6 percentage points increase), reduce the share of xenophobic messages over the following four weeks by 50% (i.e., 0.3 percentage points), and decrease the number of likes and retweets of the xenophobic message by 54% (1 fewer like) and 98% (0.14 fewer retweets), respectively. Among these strategies, analogical perspective-taking is particularly effective. In contrast, disapproval messages not seeking to induce empathy have less robust effects.	NA
2023	1656	PC01	Legitimize or Delegitimize? Mainstream Party Strategies towards Challenger Parties and How Voters Respond	The rise of challenger parties poses a complex challenge to mainstream parties. I argue that mainstream parties stragically seek to delegitimize or legitimize challenger parties and that voters react to these strategies. Empirically, I test my theoretical propositions with a quantitative content analysis and two survey experiments in Sweden and Germany. The results provide strong support for my argument. Delegitimizing and legitimizing messages are a prevalent feature in mainstream parties' communication strategies towards their challengers. Citizens follow these messages in their own evaluations of challenger parties' legitimacy. Moreover, these strategies have downstream consequences on several important outcomes, such as likeability of the challenger. In sum, my results suggest that mainstream parties are powerful gatekeepers in party systems that have considerable leeway in shaping to what extent citizens deem challenger parties legitimate.	NA
2023	464	PC07	Speaking with one voice? Analysing convergence and disunity in election manifestos and candidate tweets of European feminist parties.	Small parties increasingly emphasise social media campaigning to compensate for their limited visibility in traditional news media, allowing them to communicate a cohesive issue platform to a range of audiences. Yet, an increasingly personalised electoral environment encourages individual candidates to simultaneously pursue their own communication strategies, which may result in divergence from the party’s core issue profile. There is limited research on the presence, extent and consequences of disunity between small parties’ issue platforms and individual candidates’ campaign communication. To address this gap, I compare issue mentions in the manifestos and Twitter communication of three European feminist parties and their candidates during the 2019 European Parliament elections and a municipal election within each country. Feminist parties mobilise around a core ideology but promote diverse policy platforms with scope for candidates to adopt varying positions on specific policy areas (e.g., transgender rights), thus offering a relevant comparative case. Using unsupervised text analysis of election manifestos and quantitative content analysis of candidate tweets, this paper offers nuanced cross-national and cross-election insights into small parties’ strategic campaign communications.

2023	729	PL10	Going Local? How Mainstream Parties React to the Local Framing of Migration by the Radical Right.	While most research investigates interactions between radical right and mainstream parties on a national level, this article analyses the local dimension of the radical right's migration discourse. First, it examines whether radical right parties adjust their communication to the local context. Although these parties portray migration mainly as a cultural threat, they are expected to highlight economic aspects of migration in economically deprived constituencies. Second, this paper investigates the consequences of radical right parties' communication on migration for local party competition. I scrutinize how mainstream parties react to the framing of the radical right and whether their responses differ locally depending on the electoral threat posed by the radical right. The analysis relies on a newly compiled dataset of social media posts by candidates running in the 2017 German parliamentary elections and state-level members of parliament. The framing of these posts is first identified by using a supervised machine-learning approach before matching them with data on constituencies. This article contributes to our general understanding of local party competition, and sheds light on the electoral strategies of the radical right.	NA
2023	740	PL10	When Can Political Parties Credibly Change Their Policies?	When can a party credibly change its policy on a salient issue? As the electoral environmentchanges, parties may want to change their policy positions. Even if these changes are motivated by genuine substantive policy concerns, voters may view any such shifts as mere pandering, and reduce their support for the party. We propose that voters use the direction of a platform shift as a signal about the sincerity of the party’s beliefs. Shifting to an unpopular policy position is a costly signal of principled motives, while a shift to a popular position signals opportunistic motives. We test our theory with two survey experiments using both hypothetical parties and a real case of mainstream party accommodation to the radical right. We find that platform shifts signal motivations and policy commitment in the expected ways, even when the stated policy change is giving voters what they want. This study provides an explanation for why voters prefer the original over the copy, the persistence of the radical right and the stability of issue ownership.	NA

We tackle the issue by testing the effect of challenger status on parties’ mobilization strategies on two specific policy issues: redistribution and immigration. Our results show that in Southern Europe, where the effects of the economic crisis were most severe, challenger status increases the mobilization of redistribution for both left- and right-wing challengers. Differently in Northwestern Europe, where the impact of the economic crisis was less severe, the positive effect is weaker for left-wing parties and even negative for right-wing parties. Cross-regional differences are less marked when it comes to immigration, which is in line with the consideration that the two regions have been similarly exposed to the consequences of the migrant crisis. We conclude that the issue-mobilising strategies of challenger parties belonging to the same party family vary conditionally on the environment within which they operate.	NA
2023	1008	PL13	On the Edge of their Seats: Incentives for constituency service in the National Assembly of Zambia	Contrary to the belief that legislatures in authoritarian regimes are purely ceremonial, recent advances in the literature show that they are sites of contestation. So far, only a handful of authoritarian legislatures have been studied in light of this finding and even fewer leverage data on the observed behavior of each individual member. As a novel case in point, members of the National Assembly of Zambia (NAZ) are unlikely to achieve policy changes without the president’s approval, but this does not keep them from pursuing political goals within the institution. In parliamentary debates, the politicians regularly address issues that are specific to their own constituency, urging the national government to attend to local issues. There is significant variation in how frequently politicians from the different groupings in parliament resort to this constituency service strategy which I measure with a text-as-data dictionary approach to transcripts of parliamentary proceedings in the NAZ from 2006 to 2021. The constituency service measure provides for meaningful theorizing of elite political behavior and holds potential for causal identification in the study of authoritarian legislatures.	NA
2023	1093	PL13	Constitution-making in the context of inter-party violence	In recent decades, the international community has assisted many countries in undergoing constitutional reform in order to promote democratic development. However, many countries have stagnated or regressed in their development of democratic institutions. Simultaneously, politically motivated breaches of democratic conduct against and between political parties remain widespread in semi-authoritarian electoral regimes. Given the key role that political parties play in negotiating constitutional change and shaping political competition in such regimes, it is essential to understand how these trends are interlinked. This project asks whether – and if so how – inter-party violence affects constitution-making processes and their outcomes. Honing in on the case of Turkey, it builds theory on the causal pathway linking dyadic partisan violence to inter-party dynamics during constitution-drafting negotiations. Based on unique data from field research in the country it investigates how these inter-party dynamics affect the process and outcome of constitution-making, as well as ensuing inter-party relations. A deeper understanding of these dynamics is necessary in order to counteract continued inter-partisan hostility and violence, as well as democratic regression.	NA
2023	1168	PL13	Stepping Stones or Stumbling Blocks? Authoritarian Successor Parties, Party System, and Democratic Survival	Earlier research indicates that authoritarian successor parties (ASPs) are some of the main obstacles to democratic consolidation, and there is mixed evidence. This paper argues that successful ASPs can shape good democratic outcome. The strong electoral performance of an ASP enables opposition parties to coalesce around parties with anti-authoritarian origin or anti-authoritarian parties (AAPs), as a history of competition against authoritarian incumbents will make it likely to forge strong ties with their supporters. This, in turn, prevents the rise of new parties, facilitating the emergence of an ASPs–AAPs party system that creates robust interparty competition between ASPs and AAPs. For one thing, it reduces the fragmentation of the new ruling parties, which inoculates young democracies against political instability that could lead to regime collapse. For another, it can effectively check the government’s power, thus preventing a new ruling party from crossing the line from democracy to authoritarianism. This study confirms the pathway gathering data between 1945 and 2022 from 125 democracies, creating a new dataset on ASPs and AAPs worldwide, and employing mediation analysis with the survival data.

2023	44	PL13	Who leads? Who follows? The role of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in defining legislative agendas	Recent literature on the authoritarian regime has identified an “institutional turn”. It suggests that authoritarian regimes use institutions and laws to entrench their rule. While these findings have been empirically documented, the conclusions intensively drawn from southern Asia. China, as the largest authoritarian regime, has embarked on an ambitious program of legal construction and been experimentally pioneering institutional channels for a wide scale of participation and cooperation since the 1978 reform and opening up. This paper seeks to characterise the political attention paid to different policy issues by legislators and one of the most famous think tanks, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), and how their political interests affect each other in Chinese lawmaking process. It applies and adapts the consistent coding framework of the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) to transform the laws and CASS’s reports into quantitative data. A Vector autoregressive distributed lag time series analysis with impulse response function finds that the CASS is more likely to follow, than to lead, China's legislative agenda even though the Chinese legislature has responsiveness.

2023	641	PL13	Channeling unrest? Opposition coordination in authoritarian elections. Evidence from 2021 smart voting strategy in Russia	In electoral autocracies, opposition parties offer the best hope for regime change. Yet, anti-regime voters are often uncertain about the most credible alternative as the opposition is often divided, and autocrats possess the tools to coopt and repress anti-regime elites and voters. Using Alexei Navalny's smart vote campaign to coordinate voters around viable opposition candidates for the 2021 Duma elections, this article develops and tests a novel theory of anti-regime vote coordination in the absence of viable electoral coalitions. We show that the campaign improved opposition candidates' vote share but did not help them to win elections. Nevertheless, opposition candidates were electorally successful in regions where voters were highly discontent with the regime -as shown by using data on willingness to protest in support of Navalny shortly before elections. Yet, the smart voting campaign also helped the Kremlin to further hone its electoral fraud strategies. We find the Kremlin took votes away from opposition candidates recommended by the smart vote campaign, bolstered support for other opposition candidates, and left behind weak United Russia candidates.

2023	1787	PC13	The (In)-Effectiveness of Political Communication: How different parties use value- and group- based justifications for their demands, and how this contributes to the decline of mainstream parties	To explain the decline of mainstream parties and the emergence of challengers, existing research highlights the effects of social change, parties’ positional strategies, and the populist style of newcomers. We add to this literature by proposing that inept political communication of mainstream parties is an important and previously overlooked explanation. Voters rely more on values and less on their group belonging to make vote choices. But mainstream parties (in contrast to their challengers) have failed to use (more effective) value-based justifications for their policies and positions. Instead, they continue to rely on (less effective) traditional group-based appeals, which are rooted in now defunct class-based post-war mass politics. To test our argument, we analyze comparatively and over time how parties (in the Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria) use values and appeals to social and economic groups to justify demands in different policy areas. Using established dictionaries, we evaluate value- and group-appeals around political demands identified by regular expressions and entity recognition in party manifestos since WWII, press releases from 2010, and politicians’ tweets.

2023	632	PC13	Symbolic or substantial? German subnational parties’ use of group appeals	For parties competing in a volatile electorate, targeted appeals to social groups are becoming increasingly important. Yet, we still know little about how exactly parties use these appeals and what factors explain their use. Appeals to social groups can be symbolic, i.e., expressing a party's affiliation with or its dissociation from a certain group. But they can also be substantial, i.e., linked to a concrete policy statement. Our paper provides a conceptual clarification of these different modes of addressing social groups and combines it with dominance in the party system as well as temporal strategies as factors explaining their variance. Based on a novel dataset of approximately 200,000 tweets of all parties represented in the German state parliaments from 2015 to 2019, we demonstrate that the proximity to state-level elections, government experience as well as current government participation at the particular subnational level are indeed associated with a higher use of substantial group appeals. Our results have implications for understanding current trends in party communication and dynamics in party competition in general.	NA
2023	959	PC13	How parties shape their relationship with social groups: A roadmap to the study of group-based appeals	In recent scholarship there is a renewed interest in how parties try to associate or dissociate themselves with various social groups when communicating with voters. However, existing studies use multiple definitions and terminology to discuss different strategies employed by parties to connect with distinct societal groups. Some studies employ specific terms to describe appeals to social groups, while others explore similar phenomena using different concepts and terminology. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on group appeals, comparing concepts and terminology with the goal of mapping the state of art in this field. Building on this overview, our aim is to provide conceptual definitions and clarify terminology to promote coherence in the study of appeals to social groups. By doing so, we seek to facilitate better communication among researchers and enhance our understanding of this phenomenon. The paper concludes by outlining a research plan for investigating group appeals and measuring the strength of the signal that parties convey to specific groups.	NA
2023	986	PC13	Discourse Alliances of the Far Right: How the Far Right Interacts with the Political Mainstream	How do far-right actors interact with political mainstream actors? Recent elections in Italy, Sweden and France have shown that far-right actors are gaining power in many established democracies, partly due to their well-established networks and alliances with mainstream parties. Previous research has shown that mainstream parties contribute to the success of the far right by forming coalitions or adapting far-right positions. Yet, we still lack a long-term empirical assessment of the discourse alliances between far-right actors and mainstream parties and the extent to which far-right actors influence and adapt to mainstream communication. To this end, this paper investigates the evolution and structure of their discourse networks since the 1990s in German mass media. This paper innovates by combining automated text analysis with multimodal network analysis to analyse the relations between actors and issues in mass media debates. We analyse more than 500,000 articles in six different newspapers in Germany over 26 years. The study presents a new way of analysing discourse networks and contributes to the understanding of the mainstreaming of far-right actors and their ability to build discourse alliances.	NA
2023	1084	PC01	Setting the Rhetorical Tone: How Moral-Emotional Rhetoric Diffuses Across Political, Media, and Public Discourse	Whether a political topic is seen in a moral and emotional light importantly shapes opinion formation and political processes. However, how a topic becomes imbued with moral-emotional qualities is unclear. Prior research has investigated who among different actors can influence which topics enter the agenda. In this paper, we ask which actors—politicians, the media, or the public—set the rhetorical tone for how a topic is communicated about. To study who drives the moralization and emotionalization of a topic, we zoom in on the “refugee crisis” of 2015/2016 in Germany; a country seen as a moral leader in Europe during that time. We base our analysis on large amounts of fine-grained social media data from politicians, parties, the media, and members of the German public. After employing transformer models to identify moral-emotional communication about the crisis, we use vector autoregression models to explore whose rhetorical style more strongly diffuses to other actors. The results will have implications for understanding whether politicians have the power to set the tone of debate or whether they mainly mirror public or media discourse.	NA
2023	1260	PC01	Virtue or passion? How affective and moral frames in climate change appeals shape attitudes and behaviour	An analysis of debates in the European Parliament shows that we can discern three different perspectives on causes of and solutions to climate change: the mainstream, the green, and the populist right. Grounded in moral framing research and moral foundations theory, we conceptualize these political positions as distinct moral appeals. The use of moral frames is known to influence opinions on climate change and impact conservation behaviors particularly for individuals who share the moral frame. Additionally, affect and emotions play a significant role in how people perceive and respond to climate change. Although it is suggested that moral frames work better when they elicit strong moral emotions, little is known about how different moral climate frames elicit emotions, how much this influences beliefs and behavior, and whether this is dependent on ideological congruence. We run a 1x3-between-subjects survey experiment among a diverse sample of Dutch citizens (n = 2000) to contribute to the clarification of the relation between partisan moral framing, emotions, opinion, attitude and behavioral change in climate change discourses.

2023	646	PC01	The Personification Versus The Abstraction Of Politics - Parties' Strategic Choice Between Concepts Or Group Appeals In Political Rhetoric	Parties' use of group appeals has and is attracting extant scholarly attention. However, research still lacks a clear understanding of when parties appeal to groups rather than referring to more abstract concepts such as policies and issues. I address this research gap by building a theoretical model that makes the case that it is a strategic choice to either use abstract concepts or group appeals. Either referring to groups or to concepts serves as a mean to manage the politicization of specific issues. I test my theoretical model with a text-as-data approach, measuring the use of group mentions compared to abstract concepts. I use this measure of personification to examine how British, German, and Austrian parties speak about unemployment and immigration in parliament between 1984 to 2022. This study has important implications for the study of the strategic use of political rhetoric and for the representation of vulnerable groups in politics.	NA

The paper analyses the populist challenge to the rule of recognition of the liberal democratic system of the Hellenic Republic in the early years of the economic crisis (2010-2014). The main assumption is that the rule of recognition, which according to legal positivism and HLA Hart is the foundational rule of legal systems, provides a stable and fundamental point of reference for the measurement of the populist impact and the classification of the populist challenges from a legal perspective.

2023	770	PC01	Through Thick but not through Thin - The (Ir)relevance of Populist Rhetoric in Accommodating a Populist Radical Right Challenger	Previous scholarly work highlights the importance of populist rhetoric for the success of radical right challenger parties. However, little is known about how mainstream parties can respond to such rhetorical challenges and whether they would benefit from talking populist themselves. I conduct a vignette survey experiment in Germany (n = 4,000), randomizing the use of populist rhetoric and radical policy positions to understand how voters react when mainstream parties engage in populist rhetoric and/or adopt extreme positions. The results show that voters' party preferences are strongly influenced by the policy positions that mainstream parties adopt but not by the type of rhetoric they engage in. Voters reward or penalise mainstream parties conditional on the alignment between the party's position and their own issue preferences. However, whether mainstream parties engage in populist rhetoric does not affect voters' evaluation of a mainstream party. These results bear good news for democracy: The vast majority of the electorate is not fooled by the seemingly simple worldview that populist rhetoric offers and penalises mainstream parties once these adopt extreme policy positions.

2023	1477	M05	How Alignment Helps Make the Most of Multimodal Data	Analyzing unstructured data is often confined to single modalities, and above all text alone. Yet, including information beyond words like audio and video signals promises to reflect the richness of human communication more comprehensively. To make full use of this information, the different data streams are ideally aligned with one another. Using neural networks with self-attention, we show how to automatically transcribe multilingual text and map each word to its exact beginning and end in audio and video recordings. Exploring aligned modalities unlocks promising analytical leverage. First, it allows to measure new concepts, e.g. the speed of utterances. Second, it opens the door to a more fine grained measurement of emotions including humor, sarcasm or anger. Finally, it is possible to answer research questions that span multiple modalities. For example, what political positions and which emotions do parliamentarians display when they establish eye-contact with populist factions in their speeches? We illustrate the utility of this approach with recordings from UN Climate Change Conferences and the German Bundestag. Our paper offers important insights to all keen to effectively analyze multimodal data.	NA

However, recent work on this technique has highlighted the risk of different forms of design effects, all of which can lead to inaccurate and potentially misleading estimates of the prevalence of the sensitive item. In this article, I use data from a series of list experiments conducted in Russia in 2021 to illustrate that these design effects can be endogenous to the political processes of interest in the list experiment. In these experiments, the form of design effect varies based on the salience --- and sensitivity --- of the item being estimated in the list experiment. These results indicate that design effects in list experiments can be context-specific and thus difficult to predict, diagnose and mitigate.	NA
2023	1014	PC03	Complexity of Political Speech in Autocracies: When do Authoritarian Elites Adapt Rhetoric to their Audience?	The clarity of messages is crucial for effective politicalcommunication. In democracies, where politicians are accountable tocitizens, they strategically adjust communication quality depending ontheir constituent demographics. Does a similar logic work inauthoritarian contexts, where elites are primarily accountable to anautocrat? We argue that authoritarian politicians are more likely torepresent complex policy issues through simpler language when theyface not the less educated---what scholars have found fordemocracies---but the more educated, of a higher socio-economicstatus, constituents. This is because elites who address a moresophisticated audience also deal with a more pro-democratic andprotest-prone constituency and are motivated to use a more persuasivelanguage. In contrast, authoritarian actors use more complex languagein poorer regions with less educated population, where they do nothave to account to their constituents. Drawing on a new dataset ofRussian governors’ annual addresses in 2007-2021, we find strongsupport for our argument: elites from more developed regions speaksimpler and more congruent with their role as politicians, in contrastto the loyalty-oriented leaders of the poor regions.

2023	1210	PC03	How Propaganda Works: Emotions and Political Behavior among Government Supporters and Opponents in Turkey	Authoritarian regimes often employ relatively overt and power-projecting propaganda in their political communication. Previous studies from China suggest that such ``hard propaganda’’ can deter citizens from engaging in anti-regime behavior and provoke emotional reactions. However, questions remain about the scope conditions of these findings from one closed, dominant party regime -- does propaganda work similarly in other types of authoritarian regimes and uniformly so for the whole population? We run a pre-registered survey experiment in (competitive authoritarian) Turkey to assess how hard propaganda videos affect different emotional states and political behavior for government supporters and opponents. We find that exposure to such propaganda does affect emotions: opponents report to be more angry, whereas it increases the feeling of group belonging for supporters. Concerning political behavior outcomes, hard propaganda seems to only partly deter opponents from joining anti-government protests, but can encourage supporters to write pro-government posts on social media. Our results thus highlight that power-projecting propaganda in competitive authoritarian regimes is not only restricted to discourage opponents from joining anti-government action but may also help mobilize supporters.

2023	1701	PC03	Competition Under Censorship: When Independent Media Mirrors State Propaganda in Putin's Russia	Independent media outlets attempting to operate in an authoritarian setting face a cost-benefit analysis when making editorial decisions on what content to broadcast. We argue that an independent outlet in an autocracy will only risk bypassing state censorship when the perceived costs of compromise outweigh the perceived costs of confrontation. Otherwise, independent outlets may strategically choose to mirror state-run coverage. We illustrate this phenomenon using text-as-data methods to analyze the news content shown by the state-controlled Channel1 and the independent TV Rain in Russia between 2011 and 2021. Our results suggest that TV Rain is more likely to contradict Channel 1 narrative when covering domestic activities of those who oppose Putin’s regime. At the same time, TV Rain may mirror some elements of the state propaganda when covering other issues that are not directly related to the fight with the regime. We hypothesize that strategic mirroring has an added benefit of attracting and retaining new viewers who would otherwise not consider TV Rain as their chosen source of information.	NA
2023	236	PC16	Propaganda and Public Support for Costly Environmental Policy: Evidence from China	China has proposed an ambitious plan for carbon emission but achieving that goal may mean a significant impact on economic development and an increased cost burden on the public. How will China persuade the public to accept such a costly policy goal? In this paper, we argue that China can promote its costly carbon emission policy through nationalist propaganda that appeals to international competition. Using an online survey experiment with over 2000 respondents across mainland China, we find that the nationalist propaganda focusing on US-China competition increased public support for China’s carbon emission policy, as long as the cost of the policy is not relevant to individual citizens. Furthermore, propaganda can also increase their trust in the government and their willingness to support international collaboration on environmental issues. This study provides evidence of how China can successfully solicit public support for its ambitious environmental policies, which is critical for global efforts to combat climate change, given China’s huge carbon emissions. More broadly, this study reveals how authoritarian governments can promote costly policies by utilizing propaganda strategies.	NA
2023	910	PC03	Showing vulnerability of a powerful state: How Chinese state-owned media propagandized 2019 Hong Kong protests	How would authoritarian regimes propagandize sovereignty crises to domestic audiences? Previous studies on media representation of separatist movements showed that the state generally adopted two framing strategies: victimizing the state and highlighting ethnic or religious boundaries between “us” and “them”. However, the situation in the Chinese context became trickier with its narrative of a harmonious and powerful state. Previous research on media representation of Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong finds that Chinese state media adopt a more inclusive narrative and depict the central government as a strong, caring, and defensive entity like the head of the family. Based on the case study of the Chinese National Daily Broadcast’s reports on the 2019 Hong Kong protest, I find that CCP emphasizes the boundaries between “us” and “them” based on differences in political stances rather than demographic factors. Moreover, rather than victimizing itself, China framed itself as a paternalistic, benevolent, and caring regime which endures the local chaos and supports the development of Hong Kong. This research contributes to theories on framing strategy and crisis management of authoritarian regimes.	NA
2023	1313	PC04	Behavioural Scripts and the Effects of User Moderation in Social Media	For many years, content moderation on social media was restricted to deletion; users were only able to report content for manual review thus creating a large workload for human moderators. However, recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence open up possibilities to go beyond this traditional approach: AI moderators can be trained to act on their own by first determining when a conversation starts to deteriorate and then to decide on the type of intervention needed. In this paper, we are laying the foundation for the latter direction of research: we conduct a large-scale analysis of tweets and Reddit posts with the question of how users react towards attempts of moderation. In particular, we focus on one type of intervention: online civic interventions - a specific kind of meta-communication adopted by ordinary users to moderate their peers (cf. Porten-Cheè et al. 2020). Given that a user has intervened and pointed out a misconduct of a conversational norm, for instance by telling other users to be more friendly, we analyze the behavioral reactions towards these interventions (e.g. Kluck and Krämer 2022).

2023	481	PC04	A Supply and Demand Theory of Social Media	Because of the speed of technological change, the sheer scale of social media, and a cascade of policy-relevant crises, research on social media and politics has been somewhat haphazard. I articulate a flexible but coherent framework that draws on existing literature from media economics and journalism to reflect the supply-and-demand realities of a given social media platform. I use YouTube as the central case study and demonstrate how to adapt the framework to other platforms. The thesis is that tightened feedback loops between media creators and consumers means that these two types of actors are always affecting each other, in contrast to the broadcast media paradigm in which the flows of influence were heavily tilted in one direction. To understand the dynamics of a given platform, then, it is essential to model the platform affordances, the composition of the audience, and the mechanisms for audience feedback---in addition to the beliefs and incentives of the media creators.

Social media companies increasingly play a role in regulating freedom of speech. Debates over ideological motivations behind suspension policies of major platforms are on the rise. We contribute to this ongoing debate by looking at content moderation from a geopolitical perspective. We start from the premise that US-based social media companies are inclined to moderate content on their platforms in compliance with US sanctions laws, especially those concerned with the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Despite the release of transparency reports by social media companies, we know little about the scope of the problem and the impact of suspensions on political conversations. We tracked 600,000 Twitter users interested in Iranian politics. After accounting for alternative explanations, we find that Principlist (conservative) users and those supportive of the Iranian government are significantly more likely to be suspended. We also uncover the types of discussions that are being suppressed as a result of these suspensions. The paper contributes to building a better understanding of how governments can influence political conversations abroad, and how social media suspensions shape political conversations online.	NA

2023	790	PC05	The politics of encryption: framing cryptocurrency on Reddit	In a world where surveillance capabilities are increasingly embedded into the fabric of the internet’s architecture, encryption has been described as an important tool to protect citizens’ privacy and freedom. However, the rapid growth in encryption technologies has also allowed illegal activities to be conducted anonymously, undermining governments’ law enforcement capabilities. Cryptocurrency, in particular, plays a key role as it challenges state surveillance power and it facilitates a broad range of illegal activities. Consequently, encryption and cryptocurrency have become increasingly politicized, with little consensus regarding the appropriate scope of regulation. In this context, a central aspect of the politics of privacy and surveillance is the discourse that contributes to making cryptocurrency a political issue. To study this question we focus on Reddit, a platform that is highly relevant for cryptocurrency discussions. Specifically, we measure how cryptocurrency has been framed, with a particular focus on cryptocurrency as a “problem” (for security) or as a “solution” (for privacy) and considering both text and images. The results offer a foundation for a better understanding of the politics of encryption and cryptocurrency.	NA
2023	887	PC05	Frame Competition - Assessing the Impact of News Framing on Parties' Electoral Performance with Document Embeddings	Issue ownership theory assumes that the salience of specific issues is always more or less beneficial to a given party. I introduce the concept of frame competition and argue that a given issue can be more or less beneficial for parties, dependent on the dominant framing. I test this argument by estimating the similarity of media coverage about migration to parties' migration framing with document embeddings, using data from Germany 2013-2019. Combining this similarity measure with VAR models, I show whether higher frame similarity is associated with better performance in the polls. The findings broaden our understanding of voting behaviour and the strategies political parties can employ in the face of a hostile issue agenda.	NA
2023	978	PC05	Whose voices are heard? Making sense of framing patterns in protest coverage	Existing research indicates that when mainstream news media report about demonstrations, protesters often face delegitimising coverage that focuses on, for example, clashes with the police or the appearance of protesters instead of their message. Recent studies have also found, however, that media treatment differs along several features of protest events. I test the influence of all known features by combining a large scale automated framing analysis on protest events from the UK and data from the Mass Mobilization Project (MMP). I find four main determinants for the use of legitimising or delegitimising framing in news coverage about protest: (1.) violent protests get more delegitimising coverage, and less legitimising coverage; (2.) the goal of a protest matters for the kind of reporting it receives, yet relationships between frames and goals are complex and goals overall matter more for legitimising frames; (3.) the type and ideology of an outlet — although to a much smaller degree than expected; and (4.) reports published more recently and longer after the start of an event have a higher chance of containing legitimising framing.

2023	993	PC05	The framing of welfare fraud and the granting of unemployment benefits: National vs. regional media biases	Does media framing of welfare fraud influence bureaucratic decisions on unemployment benefits? Previous research has established that the regional environment of the “street-level bureaucrats” and the national salience of migration are major sources of discrimination against ethnic minorities. Drawing on the discrimination and framing literatures, we examine how reports about welfare fraud at the national and the regional level affect administrative decisions on welfare benefits. Our theoretical framework suggests that the discriminatory framing of welfare fraud by regional newspapers is more decisive in activating the in-group bias of the responsible case workers. To investigate this relationship empirically, we conduct a vignette experiment with street-level bureaucrats from a representative sample of 60 out of 405 German job centers. Using randomized name assignments of welfare benefit applicants, the experiment will show whether the several hundred caseworkers are more likely i) to delay and reject applications from ethnic minorities, ii) whether the decisions depend on a negative media frame, and iii) whether this potential effect is more pronounced for regional rather than national newspaper reports.

2023	1217	GD01	A comparative study of political gender stereotypes in Flanders (Belgium) and Turkey	Studies tackling women’s political underrepresentation focus on the institutional, structural and psychological barriers such as the effect of the electoral system, gendered political networks (Niven, 1998), gender differences in political recruitment (Sanbonmatsu, 2006) and political ambition (Lawless & Fox, 2010). This study is directed towards the role of voters in this phenomenon by focusing on the prevalence of political gender stereotypes. This refers to the idea that on the basis of candidates’ sex, voters ascribe particular personality traits, capacities and opinions to these candidates (Huddy & Terkildsen, 1993). The aim of this study is to present a comparative study of the prevalence of political gender stereotypes in Flanders (the largest region of Belgium) and Turkey. Unlike countries of Western Europe, patriarchal countries such as Turkey have so far been omitted from the literate on gender stereotypes, although they present an intriguing case for comparison. Based on an original online survey experiment, we test the prevalence of political gender stereotypes in Flanders and Turkey, and elaborate on potential moderating factors (such as religiosity and gender affinity effects).

2023	1543	GD01	Framing Disability: Voter Evaluations of Candidate Self-Presentations in Election Campaigns	Voters often rely on stereotypes about candidates’ characteristics and identities when evaluating them. This means that disabled candidates are likely to think carefully about how to frame their disability in their election campaigns, given that disabled people are commonly perceived as incompetent and weak, while simultaneously being portrayed as inspiring and heroic. Drawing on theoretical and empirical approaches to disability as well as examples of candidates’ campaign material, we develop a set of frames which candidates are likely to use. We propose that, in addition to not addressing their disability at all, the most relevant strategies of disabled candidates are to (i) normalise their disability to avoid being othered; (ii) frame their disability as evidence of individual strength and resilience; and (iii) emphasise the value of their experience of systemic barriers. In a survey experiment with a factorial design and hypothetical campaign leaflets conducted in the US, we test whether and how these three frames affect citizens’ evaluations of the traits and representativeness of disabled candidates as well as their electoral support.

2023	1629	GD01	Gender Bias in Voter Preferences for Candidate Traits: Insights from Conjoint Experiments in Seven Democracies	Do the public want different traits for female and male politicians? Whilst traditionally biases worked against women seeking political power, extensive evidence now shows that voters typically prefer female politicians. This poses the question of whether women are now more easily seen as embodying the ‘good politician’ as voters may reward or punish different candidate traits conditional on the sex of the candidate with a positive bias towards women. For instance, are female politicians rewarded more than males for being seen as authentic, or for being seen as having integrity? We study this question using conjoint experiments in seven countries. We show that across all candidate traits, women are preferred relative to men, and this is not conditioned by respondent sex. We argue that bias against female politicians, where it exists, is not from voters, but more likely from the media environment or the supply of politicians.	NA
2023	1890	GD01	Who benefits from perceived masculinity? A visual survey experiment	People have varying opinions of what good leaders look like and how they act. According to the US leadership prototype, leaders are regarded as most effective and desirable when they demonstrate stereotypically male or white attributes. However, research on whether perceived candidate masculinity affects vote choice and personality attributes is equivocal. While race and gender have powerful influences on how people view candidates, other physical characteristics can also affect voters' judgments. In this study, I will experimentally explore the influence of perceived facial masculinity on candidate preference as a predictor of being a good leader, controlling for the race and gender of the candidate. In the United States, a visual choice experiment will reveal that appearance-based cues may influence candidate choices in which computer-generated candidates are randomly assigned validated facial masculinity modifications. I anticipate discovering that perceived facial masculinity favours Caucasian women the most, followed by Caucasian men but not African American women, and disadvantages African American men when competing against another candidate of the same gender or race but with fewer masculine characteristics.

2023	402	GD01	The Gender Continuum? Femininity, Masculinity, and Vote Choice in a Comparative. Perspective.	Do voters exhibit gender bias against women political candidates? Drawing on theories of gender bias, gender stereotypes, and role congruity, I conduct a choice experiment in four South East Asian countries to examine how voters respond to political candidates who deviate from gendered norms. My theoretical contribution is to recognize that gender norms affect candidate choice beyond simply the sex of the candidate, as a preference for a male candidate might not necessarily be a preference for men but a preference for masculinity. Likewise, an apparent preference for a female candidate might not reveal a preference for women but a preference for femininity. Overall, I find evidence of a gender bias in favor of women candidates. When it comes to how voters evaluate candidates who deviate from gender norms, I find that voters tend to evaluate women and men candidates with the same attributes similarly, except for their approach to politics – voters prefer a woman candidate with a tough approach to politics. These findings have important implications for candidates of all genders and the party elites who recruit them.	NA
2023	1024	PC11	Affective Polarization and Online News Exposure: A UK-Spain comparison.	This paper examines the association between online news exposure and affective political polarization. Affective polarization emerges when citizens who are emotionally attached to their political beliefs develop feelings of animosity towards those who hold opposing viewpoints. Digital and social media are often blamed for promoting affective polarization through the formation of echo chambers in which people are only exposed to information that reinforces their existing views. However, evidence produced to date to demonstrate this claim is contradictory and limited. In this paper, we address this gap using original survey data which is linked to browsing tracking data collected in two multi-party contexts with different media systems – the UK and Spain. We address the following research questions: are individual partisan news diets online linked to higher levels of affective polarization? Is cross-cutting news exposure online associated with lower levels of polarization? In light of our results we aim to discuss the role of the digital environment in a context of growing political polarization and the resulting risk of democratic erosion.	NA
2023	1091	PC11	Elite Issue polarization in multi-party systems: Comparing elite positions in political communication and survey responses of German MPs	Recent years have shown increasing issue polarization among political elites in the US and elsewhere. For multi-party systems like Germany, however, polarization is more multi-faceted, and issue positions are non-exclusively divided between multiple parties. Besides parliamentary speeches for issue positioning, social media have become a crucial individual communication tool for political elites like members of parliament. Due to platform affordances, social media may incentivize more extreme issue positions in political elite communication. This study characterizes individual and party-level differences across modes of political communication of German members of parliament. The study builds on a unique data set that links a candidate survey with parliamentary speeches and MPs' communication on social media. The analysis assesses issue positions by German MPs on Twitter and Facebook and compares the individual positions and aggregated party positions in a multidimensional analysis to issue positions in parliamentary speeches. Then, it assesses the relationship between the text-based issue positions to issue position responses from the candidate survey.	NA
2023	1317	PC11	Unpacking Political Identity on Twitter: Exploring the Relationship Between Self-reported Survey Measures and Online Behaviour	Social media have become increasingly important spaces for political discussion. Rather than facilitating reasoned debate and compromise, however, they are often bitterly divided by disagreement. At the same time, research shows that many electorates are polarised along partisan lines. We still know relatively little about who uses Twitter to engage in political discussion, and if these people are more likely to be either ideologically or affectively polarised. Utilising a novel dataset linking survey respondents to their Twitter accounts, we compare a range of survey measures, including the intensity of partisan and Brexit-related affective polarisation, with online political behaviour. We find that Twitter users are more ideologically and affectively extreme than those don't use Twitter, but only those who identify as Labour partisans and those on the `Remain' side of the Brexit debate. Further, we find these users are more likely to tweet politically and share negatively-partisan content. These findings shed further light on the type of voices most likely to be heard on social media platforms, suggesting wider implications for the extremity of online political debate.	NA
2023	1583	PC11	“Antidote revisited”. On the causal relationship between cross-partisan conversations and affective polarization.	Rising levels of affective polarization pose a threat to the functioning of Western democracies and could erode social cohesion. The most prominent antidote against this development discussed by scholars, journalists, and practitioners alike is to foster cross-partisan conversations which could lead to more empathy, reduced stereotypical views of opposing partisans and in turn reduce hostility towards other parties. Most of the research has been conducted in the context of the US in the form of experimental designs. In addition, there is limited research on the longevity of these effects. To review the transferability and external validity of the findings in extant research, I apply panel matching methods to a seven-wave panel survey from the German multiparty context containing information on respondents’ everyday political conversations. Analyses affirm that cross-partisan conversations substantively reduce affective distances towards outgroup parties in the German context. Contrasting findings from experimental research, I further illustrate that the effects persist over up to four months indicating the depolarizing potential of these encounters across party lines.	NA
2023	649	PC11	Does the Presence of TV Cameras Affect Polarization in Parliamentary Speech?	We study the causal effect of increasing the transparency of parliamentary speeches on polarization and other speech patterns. Our research design utilizes the 1989 introduction of TV broadcasting to those Finnish government's parliamentary question hours that were held during the first Thursday of every month. In contrast, the question hours held on other Thursdays of the month were not televised until 2008. We calculate our main outcome, yearly polarization, with LASSO-penalized distributed multinomial regression and analyze the effects of TV broadcasting in a difference-in-differences framework. We find no evidence that televising of question hours affects polarization between the left-wing and right-wing parties, within-party group differences, topics discussed, and for the most part, who gets to speak in the Parliament. In addition, we find no evidence that TV cameras would make discussions more heated, measured by the number interruptions MPs make to other MPs. Our results suggest that politicians and parties do not strategically respond to increased visibility in a polarizing way and thus there is no trade-off between increased transparency and polarization in this context.

2023	1612	CP07	(Un)fulfilled expectations and (un)foreseen experiences in the welfare state: Implications for political trust	Are unforeseen experiences with the welfare state (experience without risk expectation) and unfulfilled expectations about becoming welfare dependent (risk expectation without experiences) matter for structuring the perceived legitimacy of the political system? Such combination of experiences and expectations has rarely been studied. Hence, we not only test which of both factors is most determinative in shaping political trust, but also assesses their interaction. The research uses two three-wave panel surveys from Norway (2014-2017) and Germany (2015-2017). Our results suggest that when testing experiences and expectations separately, political trust especially seems to decline when individuals perceive greater risks, while experiences seem to exert a minimal influence. However, the relation between experiences and expectations is more mixed, where in Germany especially unforeseen experiences have a positive influence and in Norway unfulfilled expectations erode trust. This suggests that the welfare state is fairly successful in fulfilling its protective role and individuals who become dependent are prevented from becoming more politically distrustful. However, political trust tends to deteriorate if the welfare state misses to help the people worrying about risks.	NA
2023	1720	CP07	Strengthening Political Parties: Experiences of Political Participation and Efficacy	In representative democracies, political parties play a crucial role in linking voters to the state. Yet, in many young democracies, parties fail to fulfill this key responsibility, providing neither accountability for poor politician performance nor effective and accurate representation of citizens’ preferences. Drawing on a large-scale field experiment with a party in Ecuador, in which citizens are given an opportunity to provide feedback on the party’s platform, this paper explores how different forms of participation affect citizens' willingness to become and stay engaged politically as well as the quality of participation. It shows that both participation through individualized participation (through an online platform) and communal participation (through deliberative assemblies) increase citizens’ sense of political efficacy and interest in politics. Furthermore, both forms of participation increase citizens’ support for the party and future engagement with it. The findings elucidate ways in which parties can (re)gain political trust and foster activism and they and have important implications for broader debates about democratic inclusion and representation.

2023	219	CP11	From the streets to the ballots: the effect of the Chilean social outbreak on welfare attitudes and voting (2017-2021)	What is the effect of being exposed to social protests on attitudes towards social welfare? And on voting for parties with different social platforms? While previous research has mainly focused on the effect of protest on electoral outcomes, attitudes towards social reforms have scarcely been analyzed. We delve into this question by examining the events that took place in Chile in October 2019, when the country experienced the most important protest cycle of its recent history, known as ‘Estallido social’. After almost one month of protests, which included violence from the State and the rioters, as well as several deaths and injured, the government and most political parties signed an agreement to begin an unprecedented constituent process. Did protests lead to a change in attitudes and behavior towards social reform? To retrieve the causal effect, we combine several methodological approaches, including an unexpected event during survey design (UESD) and a diff-in-diff strategy on electoral returns. Our manuscript has important implications for understanding the effect of protests on political attitudes and behavior.	NA
2023	324	BO047	Guilt and Protest Demobilization	Regardless of how large or successful protests are, every movement eventually fades out and demobilizes — less and less people participate until no further protest events are held. Scholars have extensively studied factors that increase mobilization and lead people to start or continue protesting. Why, however, protests demobilize remains little understood. In this paper, we revisit the question of why protests demobilize. Based on previous research highlighting the role of emotions for mobilization, we ask whether regulated emotions explain protest demobilization at the individual level. To test this mechanism, we conduct online experiments that randomly assign respondents to protest participation, which varies their ability to regulate negative emotion. We find support for the expectation that emotion regulation through protest decreases the likelihood of further protest. This raises a crucial puzzle: Factors that initially contributed to why individuals start protesting are diminished through this activity, which in turn reduces protest participation.	NA
2023	664	CP07	What affects voters' confidence in election outcomes?	What affects voters' confidence in election outcomes? Recent events in varied democracies -- from Kenya to the United States -- demonstrate that voter confidence in elections matters. Research on the determinants of voter confidence, however, remains fractionalized across sub-fields, both topically and methodologically. For instance, Americanists focus on partisanship and, to a lesser degree, voter experiences at the polling station on election day. Comparativists tend to examine legal challenges, political violence, and electoral fraud. While all of these factors may shape voter confidence in an election, we have little sense of their relative impact. Our work bridges these diverse foci across sub-fields, seeking to understand both (a) the relative effects of many factors on voter confidence and (b) how these effects vary across different national contexts. This project reports the result of a multi-country conjoint experiment in which respondents are confronted with randomized election and post-election scenarios. These scenarios feature both 'micro-level' determinants of voter confidence (like election-day experiences) and 'macro-level' determinants (like legal challenges or candidate concessions).	NA
2023	1502	GD12	The sexual violence epidemic: methdological advances to measure its prevalence	While formal gender equality is advancing globally, gender-based violence, and specifically sexual violence, remain an epidemic. A crucial issue regarding sexual violence (SV) is the lack of accurate data to estimate its prevalence. Existing estimates come from population-based surveys, which, by asking for a limited range of episodes, and specific types of aggressors, may be under-reporting SV. We examine this by employing data from a unique, and comprehensive surveys on SV with over one million responses worldwide. We explore to which extent current surveys reflect actual tendencies of SV by comparing common SV and rape survey questions with more nuanced, and fine-grained ones. Additionally, we use open-ended questions on episodes of sexual violence to detect forms of SV that have been overlooked by previous surveys. Our findings indicate that the magnitude and diversity of SV cannot be detected by existing survey data, and that the typical rape questions in surveys under-report rape by an average of 50%. Our results have broad implications to the study of SV.	NA
2023	1983	GD12	Who talks about gender based violence and why? A twitter analysis of members of parliament in Germany, UK, and Sweden	Since the start of the pandemic, experts around the world have warned that individuals living in abusive households may be at greater risk of harm during lockdowns due to increased unemployment and isolation in the home. While several governments throughout Europe recognized the issue at hand and many increased funding to support victims, the issue of gender based violence has become highly politicized and weaponized against immigrant groups and minority cultures. In this paper, I look at how gender based violence is framed by members of different political parties and when and how the framing is used to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. I hypothesize that the far right political parties will be the most likely to discuss gender based violence in relation to immigration related issues, but that even among the left, gender based violence will at times also be tied to issues of immigration. However, the expectation is that the far right will discuss gender based violence with immigration at higher rates than any other party.	NA
2023	238	GD12	Requiem for a Shock : How salient shocks affect local gender social norms	Previous research has documented the importance and persistence of social norms, but there is limited understanding of whether they can change in the short run. This article examines the ability of social norms, and in particular, gender norms in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, to quickly and lastingly shift. I test whether significant local shocks may push some societies towards a deviation from their social norm, while similar societies remain static and stable in the absence of such disturbing force. In Sweden, the country was particularly shocked by allegations of sexual harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault on the 24th of November 2017, which led to salient discussions about systematic gender-related violence and harassment. This paper estimates the impact of the Arnault scandal on attitudes towards women´s rights, by exploiting individual-level survey data from the European Values Study 2017. Using both a regression discontinuity and a differences-in-differences approach, I find a sharp and long-lasting upwards movement on Sweden, while no significant change is found in Denmark.	NA
2023	245	PE19	Do Gender Quotas in Local Governance Affect Access to Justice? Evidence from India's Randomized Reservations	We explore whether the implementation of gender-based electoral quotas across Indianvillage councils affects access to justice for those seeking help from the state, especially women. We use an unprecedented dataset of individual-level police reports from 2015-2021 of a major Indian state to explore differences in registration patterns across ‘treated’ and ‘control’ councils or gram panchayats. We then merge these records with district court files to trace the full trajectory of complaints across the entire criminal justice system. In so doing, we aim to estimate the causal effect of the quota policy not only vis-`a-vis the narrow question regarding the process of reporting (e.g., police filings), but also in terms of final outcomes (i.e., judicial verdicts). To shed light on mechanisms, as well as place citizen voices at the center of our research agenda, we complement our statistical analyses by applying machine learning and text-as-data techniques on victims’ first-person testimonies to law enforcement.

2023	778	GD12	Shades of sexual violence: under which conditions can victims identify sexual violence experience as such?	While formal gender equality is advancing globally, gender-based violence, and sexual violence more particularly, remain an important epidemic. Crucial to this epidemic is its detection. Under which conditions do victims of sexual violence perceive themselves as such? Does the ‘objective’ experience of sexual violence automatically translate into a perception of having suffered this violence? We argue that while this may be the case generally, particular factors may encourage/hinder the correct perception of this phenomena. We posit that the relationship with the aggressor, the type of violence suffered, repetition and partisanship may shape sexual violence identification. Using a unique and comprehensive survey of sexual violence victimization, with over 500,000 responses, we find supportive evidence of our argument. Results suggest that the type of sexual violence, the relationship with the aggressor and partisanship matter to sexual violence identification. Our findings have broader implications to the study of sexual violence, but also the current political climate of an increasing feminist movement and gender backlash.	NA
2023	1526	PC14	Free Speech For Me, A Mute Button For You?	Perceived barriers to freedom of expression and accusations of politically motivated silencing behaviors (“cancel culture”) are a seemingly important political cleavage. But are stated attitudes about freedom of speech attributable to deeply-held values and convictions or are they routinely embraced for tactical and political purposes? What limits, if any, would voters support enacting in online spaces? After randomly exposing respondents to hostile speech targeting either various groups, we find little evidence of politically biased support for punishment of toxic speech. As the vitriol in a verbal attack intensifies, we observe that respondents across partisan identities increasingly support some form of regulation. We also test distinct mechanisms which may explain why support for content moderation appears to be limited. Finally, we examine whether private social media platforms or other actors are viewed as responsible for monitoring and potentially removing uncivil, intolerant, or threatening content.	NA
2023	1644	PC14	Algorithmic Microtargeting? Testing the Influence of the Meta Ad Delivery Algorithm in the Dutch Political Advertising Context	Political campaigns use microtargeting to reach potential voters, and companies like Meta offer advertisers sophisticated targeting options. An underexplored feature of microtargeting is the role of ad delivery algorithms, which we conceptualize as 'algorithmic microtargeting'. This phenomenon has profound implications for political competition and potentially jeopardizes the principle of equal access to the political arena. To test for algorithmic microtargeting we collaborated with three Dutch political parties, to place 135 identical ads on Facebook and Instagram targeting 9 different audiences before the country's municipal elections. The ads used the same settings, time, and daily budgets. We hypothesize 'relevant' audiences are cheaper and more often reached. Pricing and delivery vary by party and audience: one party pays 8.5-10.1% less to reach 1000 users. Lower-educated citizens, women, and youth (18-24) are also more expensive to reach and receive less ads. Our research has severe implications for political campaigning and democracy. Some parties spend more to woo voters, creating an uneven playing field. Underrepresented groups are more expensive to reach and less likely to receive political ads, isolating them from election information.	NA
2023	806	PC14	Everyday non-partisan fake news: Sharing behavior, platform specificity, and detection	Concern over the impact of fake news on major socio-political events is growing. The use of deliberate misinformation is thought to have played a role in the outcome of the UK EU referendum, elections, and in COVID-19 public health messaging. However, in this paper we make a novel contribution to the literature by examining the sharing and detection of everyday non-partisan fake news across a myriad of topics and social media platforms. Results show that even our well-informed sample (political science students) were not immune to the effects of fake news, some issues (e.g., health and crime) were more likely to be shared than others (e.g., immigration), and on specific platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). We also show that individual differences in emotional stability appears to be key in sharing behavior, while rational thinking aptitude was key to fake news detection. Taken together, this study provides novel data that can be used to support targeted fake news interventions, offering news topic, sharing behavior, and platform specific insights. Such interventions, and implications for government policy, education, and social media companies are discussed.	NA
2023	870	PC14	Online abuse, counter speech, and partisan bias: How and when politicians can speak against abusive comments on social media	Online abuse of politicians is a major issue affecting not only the victim, but also whether other politicians want to continue their careers, and how attractive it is for ordinary citizens to go into politics. This article asks how politicians themselves can speak against abusive comments from citizens on social media. Using a factorial survey experiment in Denmark (N=2000), we study situations where one politician is exposed to insulting, threatening or sexist comments and another politician intervenes to (i) express empathy with the victim, (ii) emphasize prevalent norms about abuse, (iii) or warn about its democratic consequences. Our study suggests that counter speech by politicians can move public opinion about whether (potentially) abusive comments to politicians are acceptable or not. However, our study also suggests that counter speech effects depend on the party affiliation of the politicians involved. Specifically, abusive comments towards politicians from liked parties, where an in-party politician intervenes, are deemed least acceptable, while similar comments to politicians from disliked parties, with an out-party politician intervening, are deemed most acceptable. The implications for democratic politics are discussed.	NA
2023	1044	PC15	Way too complicated and not nearly nuanced enough: Effects of inaccessible and unsophisticated elite political discourse	Contemporary political discussions are often subject to criticism for increasing simplification and 'sloganization'. Yet, there are also explicit calls for simpler political discourse, expressing worries about politicians' overly complex talk. These concerns may seem contradictory at first, but co-exist on different levels: the form is too complex (inaccessible) and the content too simple (unsophisticated). Existing work on the effects of these discourse characteristics in the political realm is scarce, tends to focus on one of the two types, and presents mixed findings. As a result, we still lack insight into how different forms of simplicity and complexity impact the way citizens think about politics and perceive politicians. To better understand the separate and combined effects of these two dimensions, a preregistered 2x2 experiment was conducted (N=2000). Respondents were presented with (un)sophisticated and (in)accessible excerpts from fictional election debates, followed by a thought-listing exercise and measures of political attitudes. Preliminary results indicate that unsophisticated discourse negatively impacts reasoning tendencies and the image of politicians. In contrast, inaccessible language does not seem to have the same negative effect.	NA
2023	1106	PC06	The effect of politicians hostility toward the media	Despite their mutual relationship with journalists, some politicians, especially populist right-wing ones, have distanced themselves from the media landscape and increasingly happen to shame individual journalists or attack and criticize the whole media system. In view of that, the present paper aims to assess whether observing politicians that shame the media affects the attitudes of media consumers, reducing the credibility of the content of the news and altering their trust in the media outlet. Based on studies on party cues, confirmation bias and media selectivity, we argue that shaming an ideologically distant media outlet will be more effective when this act is performed by a politician appreciated by citizens and when the media outlet retains a weak reputation in their eyes. Focusing on news related to immigration, issued by one left-wing and one right-wing newspaper, we test our hypotheses through a vignette survey experiment administered, on a sample of 4000 respondents, in two countries, Norway and Italy, to account for differences related to the nature of media system, partisan media, and the level of political parallelism between media and politics.

2023	1208	PC15	The effect of post-truth discourse on citizen’s political position	Does post-truth rhetoric communicated by political parties influence voter choice? I propose a shift in discussing post-truth dissociating it from the misinformation objective facts dichotomy to associating it with discourse. Building on this fundamental shift of theorizing post-truth as discourse, I design an online endorsement survey experiment to be administered to a random sample of 800 people in the UK recruited from Prolific securing gender balance. The survey estimates the effect of post-truth rhetoric on voters’ decision to uphold their political position. Specifically, I test citizens’ level of trustworthiness associated with post-truth accounts communicated by political parties and their decision to uphold their political position. The survey uses variations of rhetoric vignettes (post-truth, lie, and facts) to estimate the effects of post-truth rhetoric on trustworthiness perceptions and voting intentions.	NA
2023	1222	PC15	Routes to Representation: Presenting a Conjoint Experiment Investigating the Effects of Unelected Representation	Theoretical advancements in political representation have put forward the idea that representation is the result of representative claim-making, effectively expanding representation to include also unelected representation. Unelected representation refers to representative claim-making done by political activists on behalf of self-created constituencies. This paradigm shift in political representation and its democratic implications is severely under-explored in empirical political science. Therefore we set out to investigate the effects of unelected representation through routes to representation. We conceptualize the routes to representation as; descriptive representation, through demographic congruence, substantive representation through issue congruence, and psychological representation through personality congruence. We conducted a conjoint experiment in Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Romania (N=8279) and found support for all routes to representation. Importantly this paper highlights that unelected representation can influence how citizens feel represented and that there are several routes to experience this representation. Importantly, we also uncover detours to representation as the effect of issue congruence is largely dependent on individual and contextual factors. In conclusion, we provide a novel perspective on unelected representation and set the stage for new models of representation.	NA
2023	1070	CP10	Populism and health emergency responses: a cross-national analysis	Governments have responded variably to the pandemic in terms of health and economic policies (Hale et al., 2020). Based on the current literature, mostly drawn on case studies, it is still not clear whether populist leaders downplayed the adequate response to the crisis (Wondreys & Mudde, 2020). Against this backdrop, this paper investigates how medical populism, as a type of ideology amidst a health crisis centred on distrust in scientific evidence (Lasco, 2020), affected COVID-related policies. Drawing on a novel large-N time-series cross-sectional dataset, this paper seeks to a) identify whether populism plays a role in explaining the variations in health and economic support responses and b) disentangle political ideology from populism effects. I compiled data on policy, populism, political institutions, state capacity, ideology and health outcomes covering 147 national governments in 121 countries over 32 months. The paper further exploits federal contexts where governors have significant autonomy on policy, by relying on a comparative quantitative case study with Brazil and the USA. Therefore, the paper sheds light on populist policy responses in times of crisis in a comparative perspective.	NA
2023	1818	CP10	Do left-wing policies fuel far right success? Quasi-experimental evidence from Spain	In the last decades support for the far right has surged in countries all over the world. One of the explanations of this success alludes to voters’ reaction to the policies implemented by mainstream parties, although it is unclear which are more likely to fuel their advance. On the one hand, conservative policies can legitimize far right parties’ agenda and pave their way. On the other hand, progressive policies can backlash as right-wing voters might polarize and look for more extreme alternatives as a counterbalance. In this paper we investigate the causal effect of the partisanship of the incumbent government on the electoral results of radical right parties. We focus on close local elections in Spain and the emergence of the far right party Vox. We compare radical right success following a narrowly-winning left-wing (right-wing) government through a regression discontinuity design. We find that municipalities exposed to left-wing policies increased the vote to the far right in around 4 percentage points. This evidence suggests that progressive policies might backlash by providing incentives for conservative voters to support far right parties.	NA
2023	1915	CP10	Is Populism just “Majoritarian” Democracy? (Alternatively, is British politics intrinsically populist?)	Definitions of populism have tended to involve long lists of characteristics drawn from diverse cases (see summaries in Canovan 1981 and Laclau 2005). Most include opposition between the “pure people” and corrupt elites (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017). However, populism has another simpler meaning in political theory – it is simply the belief that “will of the people” exists and should be followed (Riker 1981). Following Canovan (2002), I will argue that it is better to define populism strictly in those terms, and that all the other characteristics are epiphenomenal. Once you accept the idea of the “will of the people”, you can explain the emergence of the other characteristics in the appropriate circumstances. While drawing on Canovan’s (2002) analysis, I dispute the idea that non-populist forms of democracy are less appealing because they are opaque and harder to understand. This seems to be empirically untrue. Support for democracy in countries with more pluralist or pragmatist forms of democracy remain high. A viable alternative ideology of democracy does exist. The “crisis of democracy” is actually the crisis of populist, winner-take-all democracy.	NA
2023	548	BO73	Can Populist Parties Increase Electoral Turnout? The Case of the M5S Movement in Italy	Can populist parties increase electoral turnout? On the one hand, classical scholarship suggests that populist movements mobilize disenfranchised citizens by providing an alternative to established parties -- the 'corrective for democracy' hypothesis. On the other hand, populist parties might as well decrease voter turnout by inflaming societal divides and excluding minority groups. We turn to the Italian Movimento Cinque Stelle, arguably one of the most relevant populist parties, which followed the unusual practice of coordinating all political activities on a public online platform. We webscraped the entire event history of the Movement's more than 1,000 local branches with over 200,000 geocoded political activities to study how the staggered local emergence of M5S chapters affects electoral turnout. Using staggered difference-in-differences models on election results and surveys spanning thirty years, our preliminary analyses suggest that the rise of M5S decreases turnout. Our findings have important implications for the study of turnout in contemporary democracies and the negative consequences of populism in the electoral arena.	NA
2023	1394	CP04	How does the left lose? The detrimental effect of PR electoral systems on the right’s political representation	Electoral systems have an impact on parties and voters’ ideology as well as public policy. Previous literature argues that PR systems are more likely to benefit the left (Iversen and Soskice 2006). According to Rodden (2019), geography is the crucial driver of the right’s advantage in elections held under majoritarian rules: the concentration of left-wing voters in urban districts produces an overrepresentation of right-wing parties in legislatures elected through majoritarian systems. However, his evidence is practically confined to the US and factors other than geography are neglected. In this paper, we show that left-wing parties maximize votes and seats under PR, particularly when the average district magnitude is high, and its variance is small. We also test whether other variables such as strategic vote or malapportionment play a role to explain these patterns by examining empirical evidence from 20 OECD countries between 1945 and 2018.	NA
2023	1554	PL11	The RiLe index of party ideology - A reductio	The RiLe Index based on the data from the Manifesto Project is one of the most widespread measures of parties' political or ideological positions. Despite being subject to criticism from various authors, it does not seem to have lost in popularity or reputation. There may be a variety of reasons for the continued popularity of this index: (1) that it gives the 'right' results, (2) that its construction is conveniently simple and easy to understand, (3) alternatives often involve complicated substantial and methodological considerations that seem intransparent to most applied researchers, and (4) criticisms usually are buried in appendices of methodological papers that propose alternatives.The paper addresses this situation by highlighting the (implicit) assumptions behind the RiLe index and by demonstrating some paradoxical implications of these assumptions: The better the fit between these assumptions and reality, the more the RiLe index both exaggerates and occludes the actual movements of political parties. The consequences of these distortions are illustrated by a re-analysis of recent publications.	NA
2023	715	PL11	How responsibility voting causes mainstream party decline: the case of Social Democratic parties	Mainstream parties have faced challenges to electoral dominance in many countries. Most accounts of these changes focus either on declining social cleavages or on parties’ issue strategies. However, mainstream parties may also be less successful in appealing to ‘responsibility voters’: segments of the electorate that care about valence outcomes and competence. We argue that, while these voters have traditionally been a main source of mainstream party success, they have increasingly turned towards new competitors. This is because responsibility voters privilege parties with governing experience, but the number of such parties has increased due to the fragmentation of party systems, increasing the choice set of responsibility voters. This broader choice set also has implications for how voters react to competence signals, e.g. good or bad economic conditions. To test our theory, we use the example of Social Democratic parties and provide new evidence from a choice-based experiment and observational data from the European Election Study. The tests show whether party system change has self-reinforcing effects on mainstream party decline.	NA
2023	836	PL11	Valence Attacks in Multi-Party Elections	How do political parties attack each other in multi-party systems? While voters in multi-party systems respond to attacks on the honesty, integrity, and competence of political actors, it is unclear whether and how political parties use these valence attacks strategically. I argue that valence attacks are more likely to occur in multi-party systems when they appear legitimate to voters. I connect the vast literature on spatial competition with the one on valence attacks and argue that incumbency and issue ownership increase the public perception of legitimacy and make attacks more likely. Using data from 24 recent elections in ten European countries, I show that valence attacks in multi-party systems focus on incumbents and are predominantly connected to substantive issues. These findings have important implications for the literature on valence attacks by parties as well as the one on strategic position taking in electoral competition.	NA
2023	882	PL11	Parties' issue adaptation between elections	Are parties responsive to short-term changes in election polls? While party responsiveness to election results has received much attention, we know little about the dynamics of issue attention between elections. Building on sociological institutionalism, we argue that parties dynamically respond to the declining electoral support in the polls, and adopt the issue focus of successful parties. We use supervised machine learning methods to build a dynamic measure of parties' issue attention, based on a new comprehensive dataset of more than 250,000 press releases from 68 parties across nine countries from 2010 until 2020. The results reveal that parties indeed adopt the issue lead of successful competitors. Parties' issue adaptation further increases over the electoral cycle. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of party responsiveness and the dynamics of electoral competition.	NA
2023	141	GD08	Women Party Brokers: Towards a Gendered Theory of Broker-Party Relations	While many studies examine how brokered clientelism serves as a central mechanism linking parties and voters in many new democracies, scholars have only recently begun to explore how brokerage is mediated by gender. We investigate how clientelist parties manage men and women brokers differently from each other. We focus on two questions: what traits of women brokers do parties value relative to men? How are female brokers compensated relative to men? We analyze panel survey data from party brokers affiliated with Ghana’s ruling party. Our descriptive results demonstrate that women brokers are much rarer than their male counterparts, but are also selected by the party based on different characteristics. In terms of payment, women brokers are much more likely to be compensated for their activism than men brokers despite, on average, doing less work for the party. We use our descriptive results to propose an alternative framework of party-broker relations specific to gender. Our results imply that studies of brokered politics need to be more sensitive to how gender relations affect clientelist strategies.	NA
2023	1713	GD03	When are women used as policy experts? Institutional and partisan drivers of the appointment of women to government expert committees	Experts play an influential role in policymaking in advanced democracies. While we know a lot about women’s advancement in politics, far less attention has been paid to women as policy experts. To address this gap, we study governmental appointment of women to policy commissions. We argue that gender quotas with enforcement mechanisms are likely to be crucial for women's inclusion, particularly in traditionally male-dominated policy areas. For women to become chairs, however, we argue that quotas are a less effective tool, which means that government ideology, policy area, and the gender of the appointing minister becomes more important. To test these conjectures, we use a novel dataset containing the full universe of top-level ad hoc advisory policy commissions (“NOUs”) and their members in Norway from 1970 until 2020, i.e., 13,000 members across 1,500 commissions. We find that quotas increase women’s representation when mechanisms of enforcement and veto points have been established. We document mixed support for the role of female ministers and partisanship. This paper helps uncover a key but overlooked source of gender bias in government policymaking.	NA
2023	2010	GD03	Representation, Revolving, & Blending: Contractors in the Bureaucratic Workforce	Recent scholarship has sounded the alarm about the extent to which the US federal bureaucracy has outsourced its work to a contractor workforce. Many of the concerns raised pertain to oversight and ethical issues introduced by contractors performing public sector services, but I argue that the contractor workforce itself raises important issues worthy of consideration. Specifically, the “blended workforce” of contractors and bureaucrats affects understandings of bureaucratic representation. Additionally, the presence of contractors in the workforce may bias bureaucratic decisions toward contractor preferences. To evaluate these claims, I compare the representativeness of the contractor and bureaucratic workforces using a novel dataset that compiles data on individual contractors working at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1992 - 2016. I evaluate the contractor workforce vis-a-vis the bureaucratic one on three dimensions: gender diversity, racial and ethnic diversity, and ideology. I then consider a complication introduced by the blended workforce: contractors can become bureaucrats (and vice versa). I evaluate the frequency of the “contractor revolving door” and consider its consequences for the EPA and beyond.	NA
2023	450	GD03	Women want time; men want money? An experimental study of the preferences and ambitions of public servants	Worldwide, the share of women employed in public administration is nearly equal to that of men. However, women are rarely seen in top-level management. Studies suggest that women may be more reluctant to apply for high-paying and powerful positions due to differences in job values, preferences and needs. Generally, women tend to value time flexibility and meaningful work, while men tend to value higher salaries and career development. Since public servants deviate from other employees in a number of ways, it is essential to investigate whether this also applies in a public setting. In this study, we intend to do just that, by employing a conjoint choice experiment to investigate the job-related preferences of thousands of public servants in Denmark. By varying different theoretically relevant attributes such as time flexibility, salary level and social environment, we will be able to detect possible gendered differences and to what extent this correlates with leadership aspirations. This will further our understanding of why there is still so few women in top-level management and guide future research that wish to mitigate this inequality.	NA
2023	1127	PL09	Creating Grievances: How Radical Right Parties Undermine Local Public Goods Provision	Radical right parties (RRPs) thrive when voters feel disillusioned and left-behind by their governments. A number of studies has shown that poor government performance gives RRPs an electoral edge. In this article, I argue that RRPs strategically undermine local public goods provision to trigger dissatisfaction among voters. County administrations are a key provider of tangible public goods like roads and schools which constituents rely on every day. While voters use the condition of public goods as a heuristic to gauge government performance, most are oblivious to local political processes. This makes local public goods a promising target for RRP obstructionism. I test this argument using fine-grained finance data from German counties between 2006 and 2020. Employing Difference-in-Differences estimators, I find that county councils with AfD members spend substantially less per capita in real investment. Additional analyses show that this is driven by the strategic behavior of the AfD, and test the generalizeability of the findings. These results have major implications for our understanding of how RRPs affect policy making and democratic governance, even without holding majority power.	NA
2023	1348	PL09	Losing a Winning Hand: How Radical Rightwing Parties Have Responded to Shifting Public Attitudes Towards Refugees	A crucial element of the success of populist radical rightwing parties in Europe has been their appeal to anti-immigration sentiments among many voters. Yet, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine, the public mood has shifted in favour of welcoming Ukrainian refugees. This has presented a dilemma for the populist radical right: how do challengers respond when the public is no longer aligned with their position on a core wedge issue? Analysing an original dataset of party press releases from nine European countries and 68 parties over a decade, we use supervised machine learning techniques to create dynamic measurements of issue salience, party positioning and emotive framing of the refugee issue. Our findings demonstrate the stark contrast between the rhetoric adopted by radical right in response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis compared to the Syrian refugee crisis, with wider implications for how challenger parties adapt to the changing dynamics of the issue agenda.

2023	51	PP08	Bureaucracy and Democracy: The Importance of Public Services to Citizens’ Lives and Trust in Government	How much importance do citizens attribute to public goods and services? Which impact do anticipated changes to these public goods have on people's trust in government and fundamental beliefs in democracy? Research on bureaucracy suggests that public administrative organizations play a key (macrosocial) role in stabilizing and legitimizing democratic political systems by providing essential public goods and services. In this respect, I use a major, original dataset collected in five OECD countries (the United States, Germany, Spain, Poland, and Sweden) to assess the importance of public goods to citizens’ lives and trust in government. Through a conjoint experiment I show that the quality of public goods and services is as important (or even more important) to many citizens as other key (personal) aspects of their lives. Then, through a survey experiment, I demonstrate that information about anticipated changes in public goods and services makes citizens concerned about the future and increases the importance of public goods to their trust in government. Additionally, there is also some (more limited) evidence of an impact on their fundamental beliefs in democracy.	NA
2023	953	PL09	The asymmetric pattern of voter positions and salience of environmental and immigration issues in European electorates: Incentives for issue expansion of green and right parties?	In most European countries, the salience of environmental and immigration issues is kept high by green and right parties targeting pro-environment and anti-immigration voters, respectively. We investigate whether that translates into increased electoral salience on the voter level by analyzing the pattern of issue salience separately for voters at both extremes of the issue dimensions. Using data from the ESS 2016 and the CHES, we show that immigration policy is highly salient in most European countries, but that this is most pronounced among voters with pro-immigration attitudes. This suggests that in the context of large refugee movements radical right parties' issue emphasis provoke strong reactions on the opposing side of the immigration issue dimension. For the environmental issue, the pattern looks differently. Except for the Nordic countries, the issue is generally less salient, but in Central European countries, at least the pro-environmental voter group regards it as important in their vote calculus. Further, there is a large overlap between pro-immigration and pro-environmental voters, which will make issue expansion of green parties more likely.	NA
2023	1491	PC12	Requiring User Registration For Online Comments Does Not Improve Discourse	As more and more websites allow and even encourage user comments, one increasingly important question is how to design such comments sections to encourage productive and civil discussions and minimize the prevalence of hate speech, toxicity and other harmful online speech. We leverage access to all 2.7 million comments submitted to a large Swiss online medium in 2021, both published and unpublished, to evaluate the impact of one such design choice: requiring users to register for a user profile in order to comment. To identify the effects of the registration wall, we use both a regression discontinuity and a difference-in-difference design. We find that introducing a registration wall for commenting (a) did result in a short-term dip but had no longer-term repercussions for user engagement; (b) did not reduce toxicity or harmful speech; but (c) changed users’ mode of engagement, reducing their propensity of replying to existing comments. Together, these results suggest that both hopes for a more civilized discourse and concerns about decline in user engagement associated with registration walls might be exaggerated.	NA
2023	1576	1576	Once Upon a Time We Have a Concept. . . Measuring Nostalgia	Populist actors use nostalgic rhetoric that invoke representations of a glorious national past in order to sharpen group boundaries between the ‘authentic us’ and the ‘alien them’. There is considerable overlap between populism and nostalgia – i.e. both share the idea that it used to be better. To determine whether nostalgia is really a new “kid on the block”, explaining populist support, we rely on Dutch data, conducted in May 2022. Utilizing an EFA, we explore how many latent dimensions those concepts share. The results show two underlying concepts, while using a PCA, we find a single latent concept with seven components. This indicates that there is not only considerable theoretical overlap between the concepts, but also empirically, these concepts pick up on the same meaning. To overcome conceptual overlap, we deconstruct the dimensions of nostalgia using experimental and observational data. This allows us to theorize and empirically investigate how nostalgic rhetoric impacts political behavior. Understanding the nostalgic component in rhetoric allows us to contribute to the literature on drivers of populist support.	NA
2023	1709	PC12	Rethinking Populist Contagion: A Discourse Network Analysis of the Televised Election Debates in the United Kingdom	The United Kingdom, with its mainstream political actors allegedly increasingly shifting towards populism over the past few decades, has been considered by various studies as the archetypal example of populist contagion. While party manifestos, social media posts and leader speeches are widely utilized for such studies, election debates, which have been held regularly since the 2010 general elections, have received surprisingly little attention when examining this case. This study sets out to fill this gap by empirically investigating the different foci and contexts in which political actors engaged with populist discourse in televised election debates in the last four elections. Using Discourse Network Analysis, it explores the configuration of actors and the structure of the contents of discussions on the defining concepts of populist ideology (such as 'the people', 'elites', 'independence', 'democracy', 'crisis' and the like). Doing so, the study aims to provide new insights into the relational (and perhaps reciprocal) dynamics of populist contagion in contrast to the one-directional and linear diffusion envisioned in the literature.

2023	1804	BO73	Authoritarian-Populist Values to Votes: Experimental evidence from Montenegro	What explains the rise of authoritarian populism? The cultural backlash theory developed by Norris and Inglehart answers this question based on the slow process of value change arising from generational transformations that deepen the cultural cleavages. In particular, they argue that older cohorts hold more authoritarian-populist values and vote more often for authoritarian-populist political parties. In this paper, we put the cultural backlash theory and value-based explanations of authoritarian-populist support to the test using a conjoint experiment in Montenegro. The previous work measured the outcome variable, support for authoritarian-populist parties, in two steps: i) ask the individuals which party they voted for in a survey, ii) ask the experts to locate the parties on the authoritarian-populist scale. In this study, we offer a novel methodology and measure that linkage directly by using authoritarian/populist campaign promises as attributes in a candidate choice experiment. We first show that the authoritarian/populist value measures diverge significantly. We then provide evidence that although older cohorts hold more authoritarian/populist values, they do not seem to be more responsive to authoritarian/populist campaign promises.	NA
2023	1731	PC10	The role of local beliefs in misinformation: a comparison of two fake stories during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil	Partisan reasoning is often described as the main reason individuals might fall for misinformation (Flynn, Nyhan, and Reiﬂer 2017). However, most misinformation studies focus primarily on false information that has become widespread. The focus on successful fake stories does not allow researchers to understand why some fake news pieces do not become viral despite the effort of some political leaders to promote them. We theorize that individuals might fall for false information in addition to partisan reasoning because it resonates with prevalent local beliefs and attitudes. We test this hypothesis by comparing the predictors of belief in misinformation of two false stories spread by the extreme right President Jair Bolsonaro during the covid-19 pandemic. The results of a nationally online representative survey with 2601 respondents support the hypothesis that partisan reasoning alone is insufficient for a fake story to become widespread. Only false stories that resonate with locally held beliefs gain traction. The results have significant consequences for the fight against misinformation as it points out the need to consider locally held beliefs to frame counter-corrective messages.	NA
2023	1807	PC10	Do The Facts Matter?Analysing The Effect Of Policy Information On The Attitudes Of Political Elites and Ordinary Citizens	Different types of information can be used to illustrate the impact of public policy. As a result, factual statistical data frequently competes with anecdotal exemplars for the attention of politicians and the public. How do these differing types of evidence shape policy preferences? And do these effects differ across politicians and ordinary citizens? In this article we advance understanding of these questions. Extending recent research on psychological biases for vivid social information we argue that competitive exposure to just a single exemplar can crowd out the effect of statistical evidence on policy preferences. However, we further propose that politicians and citizens process this information in different ways, with citizens attitudes being much more susceptible to change in the face of information about the impact of policy. We test the predictions in two studies including pre-registered online survey experiments fielded to a population sample of politicians running for national office and to approximately representative samples of citizens.

2023	270	PC10	(Dis)information for Hire? A computational exploration of the extent to which Social Media Influencers spread or combat misinformation	(Dis)information for Hire? Rumors have it that there is a secretive industry at play which ‘hires’ social media influencers (SMI) to sow discord, meddle in elections and seed false narratives. SMI can capitalize on their often enormous outreach to influence people’s perceptions of given issues, which turns them into a useful pawn for actors who strive to foster misperceptions. At the same time, however, (political) actors and organizations may leverage SMI’s potential to combat rather than spread falsehoods. In this project, we explore the scale at which SMI do so. We first scrape the timelines of all German- and English-speaking influencers with more than 500000 followers on Facebook and Instagram via Crowdtangle. Second, we then use various computational strategies to single out and classify the content SMI may have been hired to distribute. This project therefore sheds some first light on the extent to which SMI actually partake in ‘disinformation-for-hire’ versus ‘information-for-hire’, a supposed booming business, triggering growing and serious concerns.

2023	451	PC10	Disinformation and Regime Survival	Disinformation has transformed into a global issue and while it is seen as a fundamental challenge to democracy, autocrats have long used it as part of their propaganda repertoire. Yet, no study has tested the effect of disinformation on regime breakdown or stability beyond country-specific studies. Drawing on novel measures from the Digital Society Project (DSP) estimating the levels of disinformation disseminated by governments across the globe between 2000-2021 and from the Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset, we provide the first global comparative study linking disinformation to regime survival. We find that increasing levels of disinformation are associated with the decline of the quality of democracy. In democracies, disinformation also increases the probability of the onset of autocratization. Among autocracies, on the other hand, regimes with higher levels of disinformation are less likely to experience episodes of democratization. As such, this study is the first to provide comparative evidence on the danger of disinformation on democracy as well as the prospects of democratization.	NA
2023	627	PE15	Media literacy and perceived media bias	A decreasing share of Americans trusts the news. A possible explanation for this is that higher levels of political polarization have increased people’s perception of the media being biased against their side (hostile media effect). We study a potential amplifier and a potential moderator of the hostile media effect: Confidence in one’s own media literacy, and actual media literacy. Using questions from a representative US survey (CES 2021), we find that respondents who are more confident in their ability to detect fake news are more likely to perceive the media as increasingly biased. We then measure people’s actual ability to identify false information and find that it is negatively associated with the perception that news has become more biased. Based on these findings, we propose that improving media literacy could at least partially restore Americans’ trust in the news. Using the 2022 CES survey fielded before and after the midterm elections, we corroborate our main finding and examine the heterogenous effect of media literacy on perceived media bias among winners and losers.

2023	1019	IP13	Economic Uncertainty and Willingness to Learn about Globalization: A Field Experiment on Migrants and Other Disadvantaged Groups in Vietnam	Research in political economy has maintained that trade literacy is the province of the educated. We challenge this convention and propose that a globalization shock can incentivize disadvantaged populations to learn about its distributional effects. Of these groups, we suggest that internal migrants have the greatest incentives to educate themselves due to their unique combination of capacity to move and experience with discrimination upon arrival. To test our hypotheses, we field a randomized experiment in Vietnam by exposing half of a large nationally representative sample of respondents, including 812 migrants, to uncertainty about the effects of Vietnam’s entry into the European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). We then monitor willingness to learn by tracking whether respondents access an online video laying out the distributional impacts of the agreement. We find that treated migrants were 180% more likely to seek greater knowledge than those in the control group but find null effects for all other residents and members of vulnerable populations. Effects are strongest for relatively low-skilled “opportunity” migrants, who were pulled, not pushed, into the high growth manufacturing sector.	NA
2023	1227	IP13	Re-enforcing inequalities: The political and social consequences of internal migration	Many countries in the Global South experience large flows of internal, rural-to-urban migration with oftentimes ambivalent consequences. On one hand, urbanization can foster economic development and improve more efficient provision of essential public goods and services. On the other hand, urbanization can pose substantial economic, social, and political challenges, increasing oftentimes already strong inequalities as locals compete with newcomers. In this paper, we investigate the perceptions of both migrants and urbanites: When are migrants discriminated against and under which conditions? What, in contrast, are factors that help integration into the new societies without increasing inequality? Using original survey data from Kenya and Vietnam, we show that the reason why someone decided to migrate in the first place is crucial for whether she/he can successfully integrate. Especially, individuals who became migrants because of social reasons, such as family ties or other social networks, find it significantly easier to overcome (potential) inequalities. In contrast, migrants in search of economic opportunities or escaping adverse environmental conditions reinforce existing inequalities as they have few opportunities for a sustainable livelihood at their new place.

2023	697	IP13	The geography of trade: Relative regional gains and support for trade in the UK	Conventional political economy theories suggest that international trade has distributional consequences, and, as such, utilitarianism is core to understanding public opinion on trade. Individuals’ trade policy preferences are shaped by differences in skill level, employment in import or export-oriented sectors, or the productivity of the firms they work for. The paper adds to this literature by offering an additional interest-based dimension, i.e. relative economic gains of different regional groups. We argue that economic concerns matter not only in absolute but also in relative terms (Green et al. 2022). Citizens assess the impact of trade on their community vis-à-vis other regions in a country, and perceived relative gains or losses are associated with their support for trade. Using evidence from an original cross-sectional survey conducted in June 2022 in the UK, we examine the relationship between perceptions of relative gains and individual support for trade. We additionally match respondents to regional-level exposure to trade to ascertain how subjective evaluations compare to absolute relative gains and losses from trade. Our findings call for a better exploration of the regional geography of trade.	NA
2023	820	IP13	Individual Attitudes towards Trade: The Relative Importance of Personal, Societal, and Foreign Gains Considerations	International trade can cause winners and losers within and across countries. How do these distributional effects matter for individual attitudes toward trade? In providing an answer to this question, we distinguish between trade's benefits and costs for the specific person, society at large, and foreign countries. While we expect personal gains and losses to be most important, individuals likely also attach a positive weight to any gains for people in the same and in foreign countries. We also expect the relative importance of personal gains to be moderated by people’s political ideology. A conjoint experiment fielded in Poland and Spain in which we asked respondents to assess trade agreements with different distributional consequences offers support for our theoretical expectations. Our research design allows us to address several gaps in the literature on trade attitudes, especially with respect to the relevance of egotropic and sociotropic considerations. The study also has implications beyond the field of trade for our understanding of how citizens form political attitudes.	NA
2023	1160	PC08	Measuring the Partisan Behavior of U.S. Newspapers, 1880 to 1980	In this paper we study newspaper partisan behavior and content, which we measure using coverage and commentary of partisan activities, institutions and actors. We use this measure to describe the levels of relative partisan behavior during the period 1880 to 1900, and to describe changes over the period 1880 to 1980. We find that on average newspapers were initially highly partisan, but became gradually less partisan over time. Importantly, we find as much change after the 1910s as before, which differs from the existing literature that focuses on changes in the 19th and early 20th century. We also investigate words and phrases that had negative or positive partisan connotations in particular periods. Finally we examine whether some of the common hypotheses offered in the literature can account for the changes. The initial findings suggest that these explanations can only account for part of the decline.	NA
2023	1489	PC08	Measuring the mismatch between citizens’ perceived and actual bias in news coverage	News media coverage provides citizens with essential information on political events. It is fundamental for a functioning democracy that this coverage includes different perspectives on political events and encompasses diverse ideological and political stances. Yet, how citizens perceive and process political information, in turn, also depends on their own political beliefs. This may lead to biased perceptions of the actual broader societal discourse and exaggerate the degree of (perceived) political polarization. Past research has shown that citizens tend to overestimate the degree of ideological one-sidedness in their media diets but it is an open question how large this mismatch between perceived and actual bias is. We address this question using combined survey and web-tracking measurements for a large sample of adult age citizens in Spain. In the three-dimensional political space of Spain, our preregistered hypotheses test how citizens' own partisan leanings lead to skewed perceptions of political news. Specifically, our design allows us to identify the mismatch between the survey-based self-reported perceived bias and the actual bias in citizens' news diets measured using expert ratings and quantitative text analyses approaches.

Examining the Association between News Coverage of Interest Groups and Organizational Ties to Parties	Getting media attention is an important strategy for interest groups when seeking to gain traction for their views among political decision makers and the public at large. Media attention is scarce, however, and previous research shows that this attention tends to be directed toward groups with more organizational resources, yet also to depend on issue-level characteristics. We build on this and argue that interest groups are more likely to succeed when they have (stronger) organizational ties to political parties. Such ties facilitate collaboration between the actors on specific issues, allow for coordination of media strategies, and enable the actors to draw on each other’s media networks. We examine the relationship empirically across four European democracies (Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK) at the general level and level of policy areas. We test our hypotheses using survey data on party-group ties and data on group and party presence in the news across 12 different newspapers from 2016-2018. Our results speak to research on interest group strategies, the effects of party-interest group relations on democracy, and bias in media attention.	NA
2023	293	PC08	Who are the losers? Attribution of responsibility for election results in the age of personalized politics	To what extent and why do media personalize electoral gains and losses when reporting about election results? Our hypotheses are grounded in the literatures on media logic, party competition and electoral systems. Particularly, we expect that more recently appointed party leaders as opposed to long-serving ones are more likely to be reported upon than parties regardless of the election outcome. At the party level, we expect that electoral gains are more likely to be attributed to leaders for challenger parties than mainstream parties, while electoral losses are more likely to personalized for mainstream parties compared to challenger parties. Lastly, election results are more likely to be reported in personalized ways than attributed to parties as collective actors in candidate-based electoral systems compared to party-based electoral systems. To test our hypotheses, we rely on a secondary analysis of a large-scale content analysis of newspaper coverage in the aftermath of the 2019 European Parliament elections. The case selection covers a total of 64 newspapers from 16 countries. The results will have important implications for our understanding of responsibility attribution in modern democracies.	NA
2023	468	CP13	Recognizing Indigenous Citizens:The Effects of Prior Consultations in Peru	How does recognition change indigenous groups' relationship with the state? In September 2011, Peru became the first Latin American country to adopt a law regulating indigenous peoples' right to be consulted regarding administrative or legislative measures that may affect them directly. Since then, more than 60 consultation processes have taken place, leading to agreements between indigenous communities and the government regarding national laws, infrastructure, national protected areas, as well as the development of energy projects. I focus on consultations regarding the creation of oil blocks in the Amazon to measure the effect of a policy that recognizes indigenous peoples' rights over their territories on theirrelationship with a state they have been traditionally disengaged from. Using rich micro-level data and a difference-in-differences design, I estimate the causal effect of prior consultations on indigenous peoples' political participation and willingness to interact with and become legible to the state. Results indicate that while ethnic recognition has the potential to increase engagement with the state, poor implementation has turned prior consultations into a lost opportunity.	NA
2023	620	PE07	The Political Origins of Slum Growth and Segregation in Urban Brazil	A growing literature finds that racial and socioeconomic segregation has major implications for distributive outcomes. But why are some cities more segregated than others? In this paper, I explore the political origins of class-based segregation. I argue that federal policies that restructure urban housing markets have differential effects across cities. Depending on how the timing of these federal policies (i.e., critical junctures) coincide with local mayoral coalitions that happen to be in power at time, cities become more or less segregated. Using a close-elections RDD and a unique panel survey of municipal governments, I first show that under housing market liberalization in the 1990s, centrist mayoral coalitions increased evictions of the poor and segregation, while left-wing coalitions, instead, reduced segregation. In contrast, the effect of partisan coalitions flips during the roll-out of the social housing program, Minha Casa, Minha Vida: left-wing coalitions increased segregation, while centrist and right-wing coalitions reduced it. The findings highlight the unintended consequences of popular social housing programs, and how the motivations of the local Left have contradictory effects at different points in urban history.	NA
2023	676	CP13	Distributive politics and asymmetric mobilization	Can broadly targeted welfare policy create electoral dynamics similar to particularistic strategies? We theorize a novel mechanism, we call asymmetric mobilization, which explains mobilization as a self-selection process induced by a broadly targeted benefit. Asymmetric mobilization is based on incomplete information of citizens about the de facto allocation of benefits. When citizens expect particularistic allocation, and access to the benefit depends on voter registration, supporters of the incumbent, who supplies the benefit, self-select into the electorate. This creates an incumbency advantage. We illustrate the argument using the case of the Renda Básica de Cidadania (RBC) in Maricá, Brazil, the largest unconditional cash transfer program in Latin America. Based on qualitative evidence we develop our argument in a formal model, which we test against novel survey data. We find that under the de facto procedure of implementation, supporters of the incumbent supplying the RBC, self-select into the electorate, and engage more in activities, which signal party loyalty. .

2023	850	CP13	Spill-over effects of political candidacy on coworkers' voter turnout	This study examines whether political participation in the form of political candidacy has spill-over effects on voter turnout among workplace coworkers. We use individual-level turnout data for the 2018 elections to show that turnout was higher among workers where at least one of their coworker ran for office on any level in 2014. The positive effect of candidacy was highest in workplaces where at least one coworker ran for the national election, and lowest where a coworker ran for the local elections. To estimate a causal relationship, we restrict the sample to candidates that ran for the first time in 2014, and control for individual-level turnout in 2010.	NA
2023	136	PL07	Constituency-specific candidate nomination strategies within parties and the local orientation of legislators in Ghana	The behavioral consequence of different candidate selection mechanisms has been widely documented. However, little attention has been paid to variations in constituency-specific nomination strategies adopted by parties even under the same selection rules, and their consequence on post-election legislative behavior. I argue that regardless of the mechanism of candidate selection, constituency parties apply different restrictive and permissive candidacy benchmarks for electorally safe and vulnerable constituencies respectively. In constituencies where the threat of defeat is low, parties restrict candidacy to highly loyal members. Conversely, selection in swing constituencies tends to be more inclusive. Additionally, restricting candidacy induces post-election parliamentary focus while opening up intra-party competitions engenders constituency focus. I analyze these claims in the Ghanaian context using the NPP's 2020 parliamentary candidate selection. I draw on a range of empirical evidence including interviews and media-data. The analysis demonstrates that, in the NPP’s safe constituencies, candidacy was restricted to loyal members, who consequently exhibit minimal constituency effort. On the other hand, MPs who focus less on plenary activities but more on the constituency went through permissive selection procedures in swing constituencies.	NA
2023	1391	PL07	Pathways to renomination: Assessing the contribution of activities on parliamentary careers	Parliamentarians need to win renomination from their party to sustain their parliamentary career. Their activities over the legislative term are one factor which helps determine renomination. In this paper, we use attribution modelling based on first and higher order Markov Graphs to identify different paths of MPs in Portugal. This allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of MP's activity profile. We can show that a combination of assuming parliamentary roles and co-authorship activities creates an optimal path toward reelection, when combined with speeches late in the parliamentary term.	NA
2023	241	PL07	Information and Perceptions of Electability in Primary Elections	Primary elections in the US play a key role in who wins office, but extant work provides limited information on how primary voters choose candidates. Voters’ perceptions of electability might be an important input to their choice. We assess the effect of three candidate attributes – ideological moderation, experience in elected office, and fundraising – with a pre-registered experiment in which we randomize the provision of information about candidates’ standing on these dimensions. Because we also measure respondents’ perceptions about each candidate attribute in a no-information control condition, we are capable of identifying both intent-to-treat and treatment-on-treated effects. We situate our investigation in a real-word electoral environment: competitive gubernatorial and senatorial primary elections held in 2022. Because voters might be inclined to exaggerate the electability of the ir preferred candidates, we use a new approach to measure voters’ perceptions of candidate electability that incentivizes accuracy. Our approach allows us to evaluate how primary voters assess electability, elucidate what factors shape primary voters’ perceptions of electability, and assess their knowledge of these traits.	NA
2023	70	PL06	Strategic Representation: How Occupational Diversity Can Help Parties Build Support for Unpopular Policies	Previous research has argued for the importance of occupational diversity in legislatures, but few have established whether legislators’ occupational background affects their ability to sell policies to the public. Do legislators’ personal expertise influence voters’ perceptions of and support for relevant policy proposals? We examine this question using an original survey experiment on the 2022 Cooperative Election Study regarding a timely issue in the contemporary policy space: telehealth medical services. We document whether legislators are viewed as more credible if they have a relevant degree and background in the proposed policy area, as well as how elite expertise influences voters’ resistance to compromise with other lawmakers. Preliminary findings suggest that legislators who have relevant expertise are more effective at persuading voters to support unpopular policies, and this effect is not driven by the quality of the arguments advanced. The study reveals a strategic motivation for parties to promote descriptive representation and contributes to scholarship on policy communication and representation.	NA
2023	996	PL07	Does Candidate Selection Through Primaries Have an Electoral Advantage? A Comparative Analysis	Facing an ongoing decline in their public image and connection to voters, many parties seek other means to improve their electoral fortunes. Past studies identified the adoption of primaries as one such method. The logic is simple: by democratizing candidate selection procedures, parties can increase their legitimacy, raise participation, dispose of seemingly corrupt and convoluted institutions, and improve their popularity, public image, and media coverage. Yet do primaries provide an electoral advantage in reality? In this paper, we provide a first systematic analysis of this question. Using comparative panel data on party candidate-selection methods over time, as well as a conjoint experiment gauging voters’ electoral priorities, we examine whether and to what extent the adoption of primaries contributes to parties’ electoral success. The paper contributes to our understanding of the nexus between party institutions and electoral performance in an age of weakening party-voter ties.	NA
2023	1359	PC06	Elite Cues and Mass Non-compliance	Do the messages of political elites encourage public non-compliance during crises? In this paper, we study the effect of elite cues on non-compliant behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the effect of a series of controversial tweets sent by US President Donald Trump calling for the 'liberation' of Minnesota, Virginia and Michigan from COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Leveraging the fact that these messages referred to specific states, we adopt a spatial difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of elite cues on non-compliance behavior among in-group partisans in targeted areas. Despite stay-at-home orders in effect in all three states, we find that Trump's calls to action increased both recreational mobility and anti-lockdown protests in the following days. Importantly, we document an increase in mobility in the Trump-targeted Republican counties even when considering only Republican counties around the country as a counterfactual, illustrating the localized and exclusive effects of elite cues. Our findings demonstrate the mobilization capacity of US President Trump specifically and the importance of elite cues for political behavior during crises more broadly.	NA
2023	1494	PC06	Political Elites, Misinformation, and Mobilization: Evidence from Brazil	Misinformation is a growing concern among the public and political elites. Yet we still lack a good understanding of the political effects of misinformation. We argue that misinformation contains politically motivated content that sends unambiguous signals in favor or against a political group, thus increasing the salience of political identities and making individuals oriented towards partisan goals. Consequently, disseminating misinformation benefits politicians because this type of story is effective at mobilizing voters. We empirically test this argument using observational data of 4 million posts from about one thousand politicians and experimental data from 5 thousand survey respondents in Brazil. Using a novel methodology to detect misinformation, we show that politicians' posts that contain misinformation have higher levels of seemingly positive interactions with social media users in Brazil. Furthermore, respondents who are exposed to misinformation show a lower willingness to participate in campaign-related activities in favor of the target of the misinformation and have lower levels of affect regarding that target. Although the effects we find are small, they indicate that misinformation pays off by damaging the target of misinformation.	NA
2023	1499	PC21	How Political Agendas Form: Relations Between Legacy, Social and Web Media in the Hybrid Media System	In today's hybrid media system, the process of public, media and political agenda creation has become more visible as bargaining over which events and issues to be highlighted is no longer done by a small group of editors, but negotiated in interlinked public venues. Some studies have already traced how selected issues and topics spread between legacy and social media, however, a study that assesses how specific arguments spread in a public debate is so far missing. We use data that consists of traditional and new types of news and social media about the discourse in the United Kingdom on the immigration scandal known as the “Windrush scandal' to trace how arguments on an issue spread among actors on different platforms. We combine computational methods for text and inferential network analysis to trace how arguments on an issue spread among actors, platforms and media types. Specifically, we select important dimensions of the discussion using neural topic modelling (BERTopic), derive a network structure from this, and finally analyse the spread of information using a relational event model.

2023	1990	PC06	Are governments having a harder time influencing the coverage of policymaking?	A growing literature is arguing that classical government advantages in political communication are fading. Gatekeeping and indexing are said to diminish, even if governments remain a privileged source of information for journalists and stakeholders. The 'hybrid' media system is more dispersed and therefore much less likely to facilitate government preeminence. While many observers will share these statements, empirical evidence to back it scarce and hard to get by. This paper lays puts forth a methodology to explore government discourse on policy as weel as discours on policy in general. It uses state-of-the art textmining techniques to track policy coverage in print media to test those techniques. I test this method on a sample of French print media outlets going back to the early eighties. While the main goal of this contribution is essentially descriptive, it provides insights into why and how governments may lose control over the coverage of certain issues rather than others.	NA
2023	1077	GD05	Putting the “I” in Claims – Women as representative-claim-makers in the European Commission	European Commissioners regularly issue representative claims on behalf of women. So far, scholars do not know much about the underlying patterns in this case and in which policy-fields which Commissioners make women visible. To approach representative performances by individual Commissioners, I build on representative claim theory, measuring claim-making on behalf of women. I develop the expectations, that women Commissioners make more representative claims than men Commissioners, especially in portfolios associated with feminine stereotypes. I test these expectations through a representative claim analysis to a corpus of 15,000 speeches by European Commissioners from 1986 to 2021, quantitative content analysis, and regression analyses on the representative-claim-making. First, I find that women Commissioners are significantly more likely than men to claim to represent women. Second, if they do so, the claim-making patterns are gendered, women Commissioner´s claims more often refer to “feminine” portfolios than their men colleagues. I contribute to the literature on women´s representation in the EU, by confirming that women make women visible (differently), which is especially important in light of the Commission´s function as agenda setter.

2023	282	GD05	Present Yourself: Gender and Representation in Maiden-Speeches	A maiden-speech is the first speech given by a new member of parliament. While it is a symbolic act, maiden-speeches can affect legislators' status. A successful speech may elevate the legislator's position, while a poor one will not. This paper examines how women and men legislators present themselves in maiden-speeches in parliament and analyzes legislators' initial goals and aspirations. Women are still seen as unfit to deal with crucial policy issues, and distancing themselves from 'soft-issues' and from discussing their personal experience may compensate for their low starting point. By juxtaposing women legislators' speeches with men's, this paper aims to delineate which agendas women promote and the personal experiences they describe. Using a computational method, we analyze a dataset comprising all the maiden-speeches from Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and Australia during 2006-2020. Our analysis indicates an overall gap in the dedication to issues between women and men, and that women tend to focus more on personal experience than men. Our preliminary findings contribute to the literature on representation and, specifically, how women use maiden-speeches to elevate their status.	NA
2023	352	GD05	Why take them seriously? Are women more or less likely to be interrupted in parliament?	The number of women in parliament is growing slowly, but steadily; increasing women’s power in parliament. However, power not only means being present: it is also about being seen and treated as a politician. In our paper we ask whether men and women are treated equally while using one of the most important tools of a politician: parliamentary speech. Building upon the feminist neo-institutionalist idea that parliament is a gendered institution where the masculine norm is still dominant, women are still perceived as ‘space invaders’ interrupting the dominant norm. This can trigger different resistance techniques. Following this argument, we hypothesize that this may cause politicians to completely ignore and neglect women while speaking, leading to fewer interruptions. Using longitudinal parliamentary speech data from Australia, Croatia, and the UK our results corroborate our expectations. We find that the probability that women are interrupted is significantly lower compared to men. This effect is even stronger for women in the position of cabinet members. Overall, the study shows that even when women are present in parliament, they are still treated differently.	NA
2023	598	GD05	It Depends on Who Is Asking and Who Is Being Asked: Gendering Speaking Behavior in Parliamentary Interactions	Men and women speak differently in parliaments. Scholars have studied the volume, content and style of legislators’ speeches, but neglected the interactive nature of language and its effect on gendering parliamentary discourse. Focusing on executive oversight, we argue that speaking behavior depends on whether legislators interact with male or female members of the executive. The analysis of parliamentary question-and-answer sequences in the Croatian parliament demonstrates gendered patterns of parliamentary discourse. Women address more questions to female members of the executive than to male; their questions are shorter than men’s, but women give longer answers both to men’s and women’s questions. Also, men are more aggressive when questioning women, and more dissatisfied with women’s than men’s answers. The adversarial communication style in parliaments results from men’s engagement with women rather than being a general feature of men’s speech. By implication, women’s influence is curtailed in micro-level interactions with men in parliaments.	NA
2023	214	IP14	Soft governance against superbugs: How effective is the international regime on antimicrobial resistance?	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the declining effectiveness of antibiotic medicines due to misuse are among the biggest threats to global health and a major challenge for global governance in this century. Since drug-resistant bacteria spread easily across borders, government policies that exacerbate or mitigate AMR profoundly affect other countries. Global public goods, such as maintaining antimicrobial protection, are notoriously difficult to provide. International organizations and governments chose to address AMR by creating a soft governance regime largely devoid of legally binding rules and enforcement mechanisms. This paper presents a cross-national empirical assessment of the effectiveness of the international AMR regime combining novel data on national action plans and data on antibiotic consumption in 191 countries between 2000 and 2018. We find that the regime sets ambitious goals and achieves broad participation, substantial implementation, and meaningful change in the use of antibiotics. The involvement of the largest consumers of antibiotics has been crucial for both effectiveness and equity. Sustained progress in mitigating AMR is possible if the number of governments fulfilling policy commitments continues to grow.	NA
2023	215	IP14	Conflicting Conditionalities: The Political Economy of COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Allocation	Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic required the production of unprecedented volumes of vaccines. To achieve this goal, originator firms adopted different strategies to identifying constructing regional and global manufacturing networks and transferring technology to production partners. Originator firms also allocated their output differently, in terms of their supply to national governments and multilateral purchasers. This paper analyzes these different approaches to global production and allocation, focusing on the relationship between vaccine developers and their funding sources. The analysis speaks to the establishment and enforcement of conditionalities attached to financing, a key area of importance in international political economy, though one traditionally not applied to analyses of global health.

2023	216	IP14	Innovation and Interdependence: The Case of Gene-Editing Technology	Technological breakthroughs often reshape patterns of international exchange and interdependence, posing unique challenges for governments. We argue that innovation reduces policy autonomy among national governments in two ways. First, lower barriers to entry create opportunities for forum-shopping by researchers, firms, and other actors. This facilitates regulatory arbitrage as actors evade national rules by relocating to more permissive jurisdictions. Second, public unease about new technologies creates the potential for backlash against controversial applications. This backlash can spill across borders: accidents or misuse in one jurisdiction undermine support for research and commercial development elsewhere. Together, these processes can generate inefficient cycles of accelerated progress disrupted by damaging controversies. We test these mechanisms in the case of gene editing, finding support for the theory in data on scientific employment patterns and a survey experiment examining public backlash. Our results demonstrate that technological disruption increases interdependence and undermines states’ ability to regulate in isolation.	NA
2023	217	IP14	Exploring the Political Economy of Global Health Cooperation	In recent years, 75-80% of the World Health Organizations program budget has been provided through voluntary contributions. Unlike assessed contributions, which are allocated at the WHO’s discretion, voluntary contributions can be earmarked by the contributing member for specific categories, programs, even recipients. Although intergovernmental organizations are often discussed as actors that enable the pooling of resources and coordination of policy, reliance on earmarked voluntary contributions hinders these organizations agency. This is particularly problematic for an organization like the WHO, which is expected to respond quickly and effectively to health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines how COVID-19 affected member contributions to the WHO, and in turn, WHO programming. Using a unique dataset, I analyze changes in member contributions prior to and during the global pandemic, comparing contributions to WHO projected program budgets. The results suggest that despite budget increases, that the use of earmarking by members providing voluntary contributions remained unchanged.	NA
2023	218	IP14	Behavioral Nudges Mostly Fail to Motivate Covid-19 Vaccination Sign-Up Across Six Diverse Countries	To safeguard global health, governments had to organize unprecedented vaccination campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the effectiveness of behavioral nudges in these campaigns through a global field experiment. Behavioral nudges in Facebook ads encouraged Covid-19 vaccine signup across six diverse countries. The ads reached nearly 14 million people and, consequently, many thousands took the concrete step of navigating to governments' vaccine signup sites. However, none of the treatment ads caused significantly more vaccine signup than the placebo across all countries. Critically, reporting the descriptive norm that 87 percent of people worldwide had either been vaccinated or planned vaccination—social proof—did not meaningfully increase vaccine signup in any country and significantly backfired in South Africa and Taiwan. Such heterogeneity was the hallmark of the study: some messages saw significant treatment effects in some countries but failed in others. No nudge outperformed any other condition in Russia, a location of high vaccine skepticism. In all countries, widely touted behavioral nudges often fail to promote vaccine uptake and appear to be highly moderated by cultural context.	NA
2023	1410	GD11	The Effects of Ethnic Diversity in the Classroom on Minority Achievement and Intergroup Relations	Although many advocate for more diversity in classrooms, especially in higher education (Gurin, 1999), there is very little evidence on the causal effect of diversity on educational outcomes such as achievement and learning of both minority and majority students, and on outcomes related to improving intergroup relations such as prejudice reduction (but see Scacco and Warren 2018). This is particularly true in conflict environments, where relations between groups are often deeply hostile and unequal. We conducted two randomized field experiments to explore the effects of ethnic diversity in the classroom on minority achievements in higher education and on intergroup relations. We randomly assign Palestinian and Jewish students (Study 1: N > 400, Study 2: N > 600) enrolled in over 20 English as a Foreign Language university classes to work in heterogeneous (Palestinian-Jewish) or homogeneous pairs during class. To measure student achievements, each student completed an assignment independently assessing their pair learning. To measure intergroup attitudes, we administered questionnaires following the intervention. We discuss findings as well as implications for promoting minority achievement in unequal and divided societies.	NA
2023	191	GD11	Gender Inequality, Violence, and War: Evidence from a List Experiment of Russian Attitudes	While some attention has been paid to the gender-based aspects of Russia’s war in Ukraine, many of these narratives have been derivative of a larger corpus of literature regarding gender and conflict. There are robust findings suggesting that gender inequality is strongly correlated with interstate conflict, ultimately linking violence to gender norms. However, the linkage between war time violence, specifically, and gender norms has yet to be systematically investigated at the level of the individuals, who comprise society and who engage in social processes which are guided by and reinforce norms of gender (in)equality. To this end, we conduct a list experiment measuring emigrant Russians’ attitudes toward gender inequality and war time violence, including gender based violence. We test two treatment conditions: one related to gender inequality and another to the respondents’ support for the conduct of war in Ukraine. The findings of the experiment will be contextualized in the case study of gender inequality and violence in Russia and Eurasia.	NA
2023	1401	GD13	The framing of feminism: how mainstream media portrays the rise of the feminist movement	Feminism has become an increasingly important movement globally. But how is this feminist movement being depicted and communicated by mainstream media? To approach this question, we employ a variety of methods to analyse the coverage of feminism in the main Spanish media outlets between 2013 and 2019. Understanding how mainstream media is portraying the movement is of paramount importance to grasp the connotations, actors and issues associated to the term. Our contribution is twofold. Substantively, we explore how feminism’s coverage has evolved overtime, whether the ideological inclinations of media outlets matter to this coverage, and whether there is a growing tendency to associate feminism to politics (rather than policies). We also analyse whether feminism is portrayed with ambivalence, or whether frames have evolved into a more positive treatment following the 4th wave. Methodologically, by using multiple forms of text analysis -from manual coding to different forms of automated and AI assisted text analysis - we offer insights into the appropriateness of each of these methods for addressing this question.

2023	1658	GD07	Studying public opinion towards feminism: emotional and symbolic meaning of feminism in the 21st century among young and adul citizens	What do we mean when we talk about feminism? In recent years, the world has experienced not only the rise of feminist movements and the salience of women’s issues, but also a counter-wave against them. Yet, research studying public opinion towards feminism and women's movements remains surprisingly scarce. This paper sheds light on the understanding of feminism by conducting a survey experiment in Spain, where feminism and backlash against it have been prominent on the public agenda. Specifically, by manipulating the label used to present feminism, we test the extent to which this term has negative connotations among the public comparing among young and adult citizens. We complement this evidence adopting a qualitative and intersectional perspective to examine the definitions of feminism that young and adult people provide in an open-ended survey question with a content analysis. The paper shows the specific emotions and symbols that people attach to their ideas about feminism and its role in society.	NA
2023	1759	GD13	Nudging the Gap? Behavioral Parental Leave Policies in Europe	While the advancement of parental leave policies technically allows parents to split early child care more equally, the gender care gap and sexual division of labor largely persist. One potential solution could be a behavioral policy approach. For example, nudging has already been used in other policy areas, particularly in public health. However, it has yet to be examined in the context of family policy. This gap raises the question of how widely nudging policies are already employed to incentivize shared parental leave and how effective they are. For our analysis, we first qualitatively code Leave Network’s cross-country policy reports from 2005 to 2022 for nudging policies. Secondly, we explore their effect on the disparity of maternity and paternity leave with a large pooled dataset of national social surveys.Our paper will shed light on the prevalence of behavioral approaches in family policy and their potential to help close the gender care gap.

2023	590	PE14	Education-Entertainment and Gender Empowerment – Two Field Experiments in Kenya and Nigeria	Female-focused empowerment interventions have become an increasing focus among practitioners. Under what conditions can female-targeted gender empowerment interventions shift broader norms in a community? How do men/boys react to empowerment interventions that target women/girls? Motivated by these questions, we designed a two-part RCT to understand the effects of an empowerment media campaign targeting teenage girls. Our RCT involves a pilot study in Kenya and a scale-up study in Nigeria. We seek to understand the direct effects of the campaign on the targeted girls, the spillover effects on other girls who share social ties with the targeted girls, and the cross-gender spillover effects on boys and men who share social ties with the targeted.

2023	995	GD13	Either in male company or restricted? (Anti-)Feminism and Gender in Right-Wing Populist Political Communication	With the question of gender equality and -inclusiveness becoming increasingly salient in party competition, group appeals to female voters seem rather common across parties. Yet, we know surprisingly little about party differences in appeals to women and the role right-wing populist party ideology plays for their form. Identifying (anti-)feminism as an element structuring social group identities, we scrutinize the supply-side of party competition on groups. We examine group appeals across time, countries and communication channels, namely in parliamentary speeches and manifestos from Germany, Austria and Switzerland for a time period of thirty years (1990-2021). We automatically identify appeals to women using an innovative combination of dictionaries and recognition of grammatically female nouns. Further, we use automatic topic classification to identify the policy areas connected to these group appeals. Finally, we develop a measure to classify group appeals as (anti-)feminist and examine the explanatory factor of right-wing populist ideology. The analysis has implications for our understanding of the role of gender in (right-wing populist) party communication and the link between group appeals and party ideology.	NA
2023	1117	CP06	Bottom-up accountability mechanisms in undemocratic settings. A survey experiment from Sierra Leone. (Provisional title)	How do citizens sanction unelected traditional leaders? In societies where the socio-economic and political spheres are embedded, I expect citizens to use sanctioning channels that affect the chiefs' economic, social, or political power. I expect that citizens choose sanctioning mechanisms according to their relative costs and effectiveness. I test these hypotheses using a survey experiment in two rural areas of Sierra Leone, in which I randomly select two hundred households at each site. The experimental design disentangles how sanction mechanisms operate, grasps the diversity of sanctioning practices according to citizens' social and economic status, and identifies whether the chiefdom's structure moderates sanctioning practices. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first experimental work that offers the possibility to deepen our understanding of the varieties of bottom-up check-and-balance mechanisms between citizens and non-elected leaders.

2023	1183	CP06	When Credibility and Ambiguity Collide: Citizens as Democratic Judges	Incumbent-led democratic erosion is sweeping across democracies. Research suggests that citizens’ acquiescence to anti-democratic government actions is key to understand the success of autocratization. Existing research assumes citizens know when specific actions erode democracy. Yet is unclear under which circumstances citizens actually recognize autocratization attempts. Citizens face competing claims when an incumbent undertakes autocratic action. The autocratizing incumbent claims there is a sound justification, while pro-democracy actors (‘democratic defenders’) assert it erodes democracy. We examine how citizens evaluate these competing claims. We argue citizens judge the ‘democratic quality’ of an action based on the strength of an autocratizer’s justification and the credibility of the democratic defender. In addition, some actions more blatantly attack democracy, while others are more subtle. We therefore expect blatancy to have a moderating effect on the autocratizer’s justification and the defender’s credibility. We present a factorial experiment to test these arguments. Doing so, we contribute to the literature on democratic recession and democratic defence, by exploring how elite actors vie for the citizens’ support who judge which actions are democratic or not.	NA
2023	1201	CP06	The Public Illusion of Autocratic Efficiency	How do citizens perceive the consequences of more or less democracy for economic performance and crisis management abilities? Specifically, do citizens believe that there is a freedom-efficiency trade-off between democracy and autocracy? Whereas we already know that democracies perform better than autocracies, we know little about how ordinary citizens view the relative performance of regime types. I answer these questions and fill this gap drawing on descriptive survey data from twelve democracies. I employ direct questions as well as experiments correcting for social desirability bias. Preliminary results show that approximately every other citizen perceive that less democratic regimes are better equipped to increase economic growth and deal with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. Meanwhile, a large majority of citizens believe that more democratic regimes are better equipped to ensure political rights and freedoms. Thus, many citizens indeed perceive that there is a freedom-efficiency trade-off between democracy and autocracy. This perception is undesirable, not only because it is inaccurate, but also because the priority attached to efficiency may increase in harder times or during crises.	NA
2023	1524	CP06	The trade-offs of democracy: Pitting democracy against economic and non-economic threats	Are citizens willing to trade democratic institutions and practices for more authoritarian alternatives? And if yes, what is it that they prioritize and why? To answer these questions, we conduct a conjoint experiment, exposing respondents from 30 different countries -- representing both democracies and autocracies -- to a series of hypothetical country profiles, whereby we vary the attributes of these countries on the following dimensions: political institutions and civic rights, cultural-social characteristics, and economic and non-economic security. Respondents are then asked to rate the quality of life in each country. We further explore whether country characteristics of where respondents live and individual attributes of respondents affect the evaluation of these hypothetical countries. This paper contributes to our understanding of regime support by taking into account the complexity of society that people face. We further provide a test of the micro mechanism of this evaluation, presenting results from a unique experiment conducted in numerous countries.	NA
2023	1614	CP06	Politicization of Slum Demolition: Evidence from the Satellite Images of Beijing	Why does the government tolerate or demolish urban slums? Many comparative studies have discussed the politicization of slum governance through the lens of electoral competition. This paper asks whether a similar logic of power maintenance exists under non-electoral regimes like China. I empirically focus on Beijing’s slum demolition campaign in late 2017, suggesting that the campaign served as a coercive tool for political leaders to remove illegibility and prevent disobedience. Combining qualitative materials, I find that this practice of preemptive coercion emerged out of the unwritten but widespread fear among all levels of officials that illegibility harms political stability. I further establish a unique dataset based on satellite imagery, digital street view, and site visits. The quantitative evidence confirms that a slum’s survival chances decreased as it became less legible to the government. These illegible communities were (1) large-scale unities, (2) located far away from local police stations, and (3) equipped with stores and restaurants for personal interactions. This paper builds the connection between legibility politics and slum governance in social sciences.	NA
2023	1153	GD04	LGBTQ candidates in US state elections: Evidence from a new dataset	This paper examines the electoral results of LGBTQ+ candidates in state elections in the United States. We created an original dataset from the 2020 US state legislative elections, which includes 7,000 individual candidates from 45 states. The dataset combines candidate- and district-level characteristics. The analysis produces interesting findings. First, on average, LGBTQ+ candidates perform at least as well as straight and cisgender candidates in election outcomes. Second, lesbian women obtain on average over 5% more of the vote than straight candidates. Third, LGBTQ+ candidates do better in Democratic-leaning and highly educated districts, as well as in districts with a higher share of Black voters. This is because LGBTQ+ candidates who make it to the general election are above average candidates, who have greater political experience and are more successful fundraisers than their straight counterparts. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these findings indicate that LGBTQ+ candidates are an asset for their party in many districts and powerfully challenge claims of greater homophobia among Black voters.

2023	1657	GD04	Gender Gaps in Political Seniority Systems	How do seniority systems influence the rate of growth in women's representation in democracies? If seniority dictates electoral success and career promotion, but advantages men who enter politics earlier and advance more quickly, this could explain why so many countries have low shares of women in politics. We test this theory using individual-level panel data on political careers and elections from 1921 to 2021 in the case of Norway, a country that over the course of a century has almost achieved gender parity. We show that Norway's major parties operated a two-tiered seniority system that was gender-biased, and we document a selection effect by which early female entrants to politics had to be significantly more educated than their male counterparts. Only after the introduction of gender quotas in party lists, and when Norway's parties began to operate their seniority systems in a gender-neutral way, did gender parity improve. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the long-term process of achieving gender parity in representation.	NA
2023	1721	GD04	Overcoming Barriers: The Career Advancement of Female Candidates in Party Candidate Lotteries in Mexico	How do opportunities to gain political experience influence the representation of women in politics? Whereas the literature often attributes women’s underrepresentation in elected office to voter discrimination and low levels of political ambition, I show instead that limited opportunities to gain early political experience shape the emergence and success of female candidates. Examining a natural experiment from Mexico, where female candidates were randomly selected and placed in elected office, I find that women who have gained initial experience in office (at random) are much more likely to seek and attain subsequent elected positions than men who have held similar office or women without such experiences. The findings highlight the importance of early political experiences in overcoming gender disparities among candidates and elected officials and have important implications for broader debates about democratic inclusion and representation.

2023	308	GD04	Explaining the Election of Latino Republicans to State Legislatures in the USA	This paper addresses the transformation of Latino Republican representation by examining Latino Republican candidates for state legislatures and providing insight into who they are. Extant literature suggests that Latino Republican candidates are traditionally of Cuban background, disproportionately male, and primarily limited to Florida, New Mexico, and Texas. Using the 2018 and 2022 C3 data sets, this paper explores how Latino Republican candidates have changed over recent election cycles, paying close attention to the geographic distribution of such candidates, their sub-ethnic composition, the number of Latina candidates, and the types of candidates who see the most success. In doing so, we uncover several possible causal mechanisms informing the increasing reach and diversity of Latino Republican candidates for state legislatures in the United States.	NA
2023	417	GD04	Ballot Box Battles: Gender, Ethnicity and the Electoral Performance of UK candidates	The UK Parliament has become increasingly diverse from an ethnic and gender perspective in recent years. However, are more ethnic minority and female candidates elected because they are preferred by voters? Or is the increase observed merely the result of an increase in the number of such candidates being selected to stand for office? This paper builds on the work by Stegmaier et al. (2013), who found that in 2010 the local incumbent party in a constituency typically gained at least two percentage points in vote share when they had a Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) challenger. This paper extends their study in two ways. First, by uncovering patterns of change in citizens and party’s attitudes and representation since 2010. Second, by studying the intersection of gender and ethnicity in the UK context.	NA
2023	1035	CP12	Polish Assistance to Ukrainian and Syrian Refugees? Evidence from a Nationally Representative Survey	What are the determinants of assistance to refugees? How can helping behavior to refugees be encouraged? We study these questions in the context of the influx of Ukrainian refugees into Poland over the course of Russia’s war on Ukraine that began in February 2022. The warm welcome that Ukrainian refugees received in Poland contrasts sharply with the treatment of refugees from the Middle East. In this study, we leverage a nationally representative survey with 2,500 Polish respondents. Using a survey experiment, we activate shared experience of displacement and suffering (of Poles in World War II) to learn how these factors affect assistance to refugees. In a conjoint experiment, embedded in the survey, we explore whether people are more likely to assist refugees who are more racially or culturally similar to them or whether helping is more a product of the perceived humanitarian need. We find evidence for the important role played by empathy and shared experience of violence and displacement on individuals’ willingness to assist refugees.	NA
2023	1435	CP12	Coalitions of the Disadvantaged: How do German asylum rights groups choose their lobbying partners?	Coalition building is an important lobbying strategy, particularly for poorer and more socially disadvantaged interest groups, but how do they choose their coalition partners? I use quantitative text analysis to measure coordination between groups lobbying for the rights of asylum seekers and other interest groups in Germany. I apply Wordfish, a scaling algorithm for analyse texts based on word use and frequencies, to compare linguistic similarities between position papers submitted to policy consultations. Papers with similar Wordfish scores are likely to express similar arguments, and therefore to be part of a coordinated network or coalition. My analysis shows that asylum rights lobbyists' positions are similar to each other, and distinct from those of others such as business or labour groups. The results indicate a homogenous coalition-building strategy, suggesting that asylum rights groups are unable to overcome institutional or ideological constraints on coordinating with other groups to form potentially more effective, diverse coalitions. I further corroborate my findings with elite interviews. These constraints have important consequences for the ability of asylum rights groups and other disadvantaged interests to successfully influence policy.	NA
2023	1684	CP12	Innocence of Youth: Attitudes toward Syrian Refugee Children	More than forty percent of the world’s refugees are children, but academic research has devoted little attention to understanding host community attitudes toward this group and whether those attitudes differ from views of adult refugees. We study this issue in Turkey, where approximately 1.7 million out of 3.4 million Syrian refugees are children. The project focuses on two primary questions, utilizing experiments implemented on a representative survey. First, we consider whether Turkish citizens demonstrate a preference for child refugees over adult refugees. As part of this question, we test several mechanisms that may drive this preference, analyzing whether child refugees are perceived as more likely to integrate, more deserving of sympathy and assistance, or less threatening to Turkey’s economy, social stability, and national security. Second, we implement a conjoint experiment to study which Syrian refugee children are more likely to be viewed favorably by Turkish citizens. By shedding light on the factors that shape attitudes toward child refugees, our work informs academics and practitioners interested in social cohesion between refugee and host communities in Turkey and elsewhere.

2023	1840	CP12	Voluntary and Involuntary Refugee Return: Evidence from a Multi-year Syrian Refugee Panel Study	When do refugees’ return intentions predict behavior? What are the implications of this alignment or lack thereof for our understanding of voluntary refugee return? To understand refugee migration, some work studies refugees’ intentions and others their behavior. Although these studies are often framed as if they get at the same question, this should not be taken as a given. Although we have a clear sense of what voluntary refugee return should look like, we have limited evidence on the conditions under which refugees are actually able to exercise this right by linking their intentions and behavior. In order to develop our theoretical and empirical understanding of this issue we present novel evidence on when intentions predict behavior or not, and what drives behavior to deviate from intentions. This paper presents findings from a 3+ year panel survey of 3,000 Syrian refugees who were living in Lebanon in fall 2019. We study time trends in people’s migration intentions and behavior and the impacts of major shocks in Lebanon and Syria.	NA
2023	345	CP12	Reducing Prejudice Towards Refugees in Uganda: Evidence that Social Networks Influence Attitude Change	Interventions aimed at reducing prejudice towards refugees have shown promise in industrialized countries. However, the vast majority of refugees are in developing countries. Moreover, while these interventions focus on individual processes of attitude change, attitudes often do not shift in isolation; people are embedded in rich social networks. To test whether a perspective-taking intervention that has reduced prejudice towards refugees in the United States is also effective in a developing country, and to assess the relevance of social processing after the intervention, we conducted a field experiment in northwestern Uganda, host to roughly one million refugees. We find that in all four study villages, perspective-taking changed short-term, individual attitudes to be warmer towards refugees on average. Furthermore, the treatment effect not only spills over from treated households to control ones along social ties, but peoples' attitudes change based on informal conversations with others after the treatment. The findings show the importance of understanding the social process that can reinforce or unravel individual-level attitude change towards refugees; it appears essential to designing interventions with a lasting effect on attitudes.

2023	1869	CP14	External Crises and Regime Change	What impacts do crises have on regime change? To address this research question, the study investigates the frequency of various crises (financial crises, natural disasters, military conflicts, famines, and epidemics) and their effects on autocracy and democracy. This study analyzes the relationship using a unique data set of global crises. The data set includes information on the economic and human losses caused by various crises, as well as the regime type of the relevant countries. The study will draw on a combination of causal inference and in-depth comparative case studies to discover causal linkages between the type and intensity of crises and alternation from democracy to autocracy or vice versa.

2023	2033	CP14	Party System Institutionalization across Regimes and Regime Transitions	While party system institutionalization (PSI) has played a central role in the comparative study of democracies, its function in non-democratic regimes is less well-known. This presents an important gap in the literature since authoritarian rulers—particularly those in competitive authoritarian regimes—have increasingly come to rely on elections and parties to consolidate their power. Moreover, the patterns of interparty competition observed in previous authoritarian regimes have been theorized to cast long shadows that continue to shape the party system—and by extension the performance and resilience of democratic institutions—even after democratization. However, there is currently no comprehensive measure of the concept that extends to non-democratic regimes. In this paper, I use a Bayesian latent variable measurement approach to develop a novel measure of PSI that covers both autocracies and democracies. I then use this measure to examine the implications that PSI has for regime stability in autocracies, and how the legacies of interparty competition established under these regimes contribute to prospects for successful democratic transition and consolidation.

2023	478	CP14	The Importance of Local Leaders for Anti-Regime Mobilization: Evidence from Polish Municipalities	A broad literature highlights the importance of political entrepreneurs to help political activists overcome the collective action problem. However, empirical evidence on the topic remains scarce, and mostly confined to autocracies. To bridge this gap, this project studies the impact of female local leaders on the development of the female anti-regime movement in Poland. Using close municipal elections, I estimate the causal effect of female mayors on anti-government mobilization, in the context of the 2020-2021 wave of women's protests for reproductive rights. Regression Discontinuity regressions show that the presence of female mayors significantly fosters anti-regime protests in Polish towns. Additional analyses shed light on two potential mechanisms: Female mayors reduce the costs of protesting by removing administrative obstacles as well as providing an informative signal about the prevalence of equitable gender norms in the local community. These findings highlight the importance of local leaders in coordinating political activism and influencing the social and political attitudes of ordinary citizens.	NA
2023	825	CP14	Things Will Have to Change?Analyzing the Spanish Transition to Democracy From an Elite Perspective	The Spanish Transition to democracy is considered a paradigmatic case of successful democratization from above, in which the political elites led the process that converted an authoritarian state into a liberal democracy. In this paper, we rely on an original dataset to measure the renewal of elites in the Spanish transition called the “Spanish Transition and Late Francoism Dataset.” Our dataset contains more than 600 profiles of the main figures of late Francoism, as well as those leading the Transition. We have collected the relative importance of each of the jobs that different kind of Francoist and Transition elites had before and after the democra- tization process, gathering information on more than 5.000 jobs over 40 years. By studying the interaction of several variables over time, we show which elites of Francoism were more likely to remain in prestigious positions, what were the factors associated to remain influential, and to what extent the Spanish democracy changed hands after democratization. Our results suggest that while there was a change in political elites after the Transition, economic elites remained the same.	NA
2023	983	CP14	Autocratization, regime transitions and inequalities between ethnic groups: an application of survival analysis	Research on how economic conditions impact on democracy produced contradicting results. However, democratization scholars overlook insights from ethnic and conflict studies, illustrating that inequalities between identity-based groups (generally, ethnicities) can be correlates of political developments like civil wars. Systematizing from autocratization cases and building on past contributions, the paper demonstrates that inequalities between ethnic groups are also favorable pre-conditions for a country to start autocratizing and experience a regime change towards autocracy. I consider both autocratization and ethnic inequality as complex concepts: the former as any downturn in the level of democracy and as a regime change; the latter articulated in political, economic, and social dimensions. With a global sample of countries since 1981, and an original data collection, the article hypothesizes that democracy is overall less resilient and more prone to breakdown in ethnically unequal countries. Presenting survival analysis models explaining autocratization onset and regime change, I found more substantial impact of ethnic inequalities on both autocratization types when different dimensions overlap. The paper contributes to autocratization research, giving nuances of the cross-cutting cleavage theory as stabilization for democracy.	NA
2023	1384	PL14	Establishing parliament: Democratization and the internal division of labour in Portugal	The Portuguese Parliament (Assembleia da República) until today is characterized by a relative high level of turnover of MPs. This permanent loss of expertise provides challenges for the parliamentary parties. In this paper, we analyze the resulting division of labour within the parliamentary parties and how it has helped to create and perpetuate a system where a small but powerful party elite controls much of the key positions and exercises control over many areas of parliamentary activity. This was a direct response to the challenges posed by the democratization process and the need for stabilizing the institution. While this pattern persists, we can show that it has got weaker over time, strengthening the professionalization of the Portuguese parliament.	NA
2023	327	PE11	The Institutional Foundations of Legislative Expertise	We argue that strong legislatures, equipped with greater de jure policy influence and de facto budgets for legislative work facilitate the cultivation of policy expertise for individual representatives. We derive testable implications from the argument regarding legislative behavior as well as the appointment of leaders in the legislature and executive in parliamentary democracies and test them with data from national and subnational European governments. We find evidence that stronger legislatures facilitate the cultivation of expertise, increasing specialization in legislative behavior, the salience of seniority in the appointment of parliamentary committee chairs and ministers with portfolio, and increasing overall ministerial stability.

2023	539	PL02	Do Legislators Learn how to be Legislators? The Life Cycle to Parliamentary Rhetoric.	Do elected representatives learn on the job? In particular, do we observe developments and improvements in their speech patterns over time? Prior work has investigated differences in issue salience, positions, and emotions in parliamentary speeches. However, the “life cycle” of political rhetoric has rarely been studied systematically. As with any job, representatives may have to learn “how to be a legislator.” This paper investigates three questions related to ‘parliamentary speech careers’. Does legislators’ rhetoric follows a fixed pattern over time, or do we observe evidence of learning? Who is it that new legislators are trying to copy? And do legislators “defect” from the party line or disengage and ‘shirk’ as their retirement date looms? We test these questions based on the (in)accuracy of predicting party labels from parliamentary speech. We validate and apply our measure to parliamentary speeches in Ireland and the United Kingdom between 1945 and 2022. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the socialisation of legislators into the parliamentary party and their representational roles	NA
2023	837	PL14	Solo-Effort, Group-Effort or Team-Effort: The inner workings of parliamentary offices on political communications on behalf of parliamentarians	The dynamics within parliamentary offices are at large black boxes; very few recent studies have explored the role of professional political staff employed by parliamentarians. This paper addresses this gap by utilising 58 semi-structured interviews with former and current parliamentary assistants. This study focuses on the interplay between staff members of parliamentary offices when working on political communication. The paper aims to answer the following research question: How is political communication on behalf of parliamentarians organised and undertaken within the parliamentary office? The distinction between groups and teams has been particularly helpful in getting an insight into the inner-office dynamics. While groups are characterised by a clear division of labour and individual accountability, teams feature much more flexible roles and stronger interaction by their members. The findings show that parliamentary offices are idiosyncratically organised and shaped by the parliamentarians’ preferences. Their choice can significantly impact the professionalisation of parliamentarians' political communication.	NA
2023	1058	PL05	Does switching pay off? Analyzing the impact of parliamentary party instability on individual electoral performance	Members of parliament who switch parliamentary party groups (PPGs) can be motivated by a variety of factors but the improvement of electoral prospects is often argued to be among the most important ones. But does switching PPGs improve or damage the MPs' electoral prospects? We study the subsequent electoral performance of MPs involved in parliamentary party instability since the mid-1990s using an original dataset on all switching events in Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania compiled by the INSTAPARTY project. In addition to analyzing whether the MPs run for or enter the parliament, we also zoom in on their electoral performance with regard to electoral vulnerability, list placement, and preference votes. We also consider the electoral dividends of different types of switching - collective versus individual, defection to another PPG versus becoming an independent MP, and mergers vs splits vs creation of new PPGs. Our findings advance our understanding of utility calculations behind party switching and inform practitioners devising parliamentary and electoral rules to prevent excessive instability and forms of party switching deleterious to MPs and their constituents.

2023	147	PL05	How Far Does the Apple Fall from the Tree? Party Messaging and Candidate Discourse Among Radical Right-Wing Politicians	Marine Le Pen has made well-documented efforts to moderate the discourse and presentation of her party, hoping to attract mainstream voters and increase elected presence in office. This includes the well-known de-demonisation (dédiabolisation) strategy and rebranding of the National Front to the National Rally in 2018. What is less clear is how successful these attempts are at rehabilitating and mainstreaming the party rank-and-file. Using original data on the backgrounds and behaviours of all candidates during the 2022 French legislative elections, we analyse the rhetoric of RN candidates on Twitter. We compare their speech against the leadership of the party, assessing the extent to which previous experience with and centrality to party leadership yields moderated discourse. We then contrast the online behaviours of RN candidates against other far-right (e.g., Eric Zemmour’s Reconquête!) and mainstream (e.g., Macron's Ensemble) candidacies. Our results emphasise not only the micro foundations of right-wing discourse in a way that has previously not been addressed by the literature, but also contribute to broader debates about the limits of party discipline on political campaign style within single-member electoral systems.

2023	1473	PL05	Independence versus Affiliation: What Determines Entry into Parliamentary Party Groups?	Political parties are considered essential for structuring parliamentary decision-making in democracies. However, many MPs become non-affiliated with any parliamentary party group (PPG). Whether such non-affiliation ends with an entry to a PPG, which PPG the legislator enters and how long they stay independent before that remain under-researched questions despite their theoretical and empirical relevance. Considering that PPG entry is among the most common forms of party switching, as demonstrated by the original dataset built by the INSTAPARTY project, in this paper, we examine PPG entry in three Central and Eastern European countries (Lithuania, Poland, and Romania) since the early 2000s. Building on the literature on legislative party switching, we test an argument that electoral concerns of both the MPs considering the entry and the potential receiving parties play an important role in driving entry. We examine, among others, the role of parties’ popularity in polls, election proximity, and the affiliation of the MP with a minor/new party. Our findings contribute to the research on legislative party switching and the rise of the importance of independent politicians in contemporary democracies.	NA
2023	56	PL05	Candidate-Party Ideological Congruence, Competitive Electoral Districts, and the Outcomes of Candidate Selection Processes	Candidate selection within political parties is an important and highly dynamic stage in the democratic process. We argue that candidates have a higher chance to get nominated by their local constituents the closer the respective candidate is to the position of his/her party core. This effect should, however, depend on the chances that a party will win a plurality of votes in the respective district. We therefore expect that candidates in congruence with their party are more likely to be nominated, the more likely it is that the party will win a plurality of votes in a district. We evaluate this expectation with novel data on the degree of intra-party competition of the main German parties in all 299 electoral districts and the policy positions of candidates, measured on the basis of their Twitter statements, in the run-up to the 2021 Bundestag election.

2023	849	PL11	From Torches to Trees: Political Party Logo Changes and Voter Perception	Logos are an important part of a party’s brand. Like a party’s name, a logo helps the party to convey its brand and positioning. As a party’s brand and positions change, its leaders may also choose to change the logo. A logo change is a party’s signal to its voters (and to the electorate more broadly) of these changes. However, do voters pay attention to these changes and do they have their expected effect—both keeping existing voters and attracting new supporters? To examine these questions, we implement a survey experiment in the United Kingdom to determine if voters notice these logo changes, how these may affect voters’ perceptions of parties’ positions and their likelihood to vote for the party. Our findings have important implications for understanding party branding and voter responsiveness to parties’ strategic decisions.	NA
2023	1625	M02	Keeping up with the trend: how to deal with trends in time series analyses	Most books on how to conduct analyses of time series data make reference to the possibility that some variables can be linearly trending. When this is the case, they typically offer two solutions—to de-trend such variables and estimate the model of choice or to include a trend term in one’s model specification. Although these choices are usually treated as equivalent for inferences, there are some circumstances where this is not the case. In this paper, we investigate the utility of different strategies for identifying and dealing with trending variables under a wide range of data generating processes and provide advice for applied researchers analyzing time series data. We also offer some advice about how to interpret and present the results from models estimated with one or more trending variables.	NA
2023	1796	M02	Temporal Patterns in Protest Events	Protests often unfold in wave-like patterns, with consecutive periods of expansion and contraction in intensity, indicated by the number of protest events in a certain time period. Against this background, we argue that patterns in sequences of protest events are the observable implications of interactions between dissident activity and state repression. We expect that similar patterns in protest intensity repeat across spatial and temporal units and can therefore help predict the future course of the protest cycle. Using data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project for India, a baseline ARIMA model is applied to predict the number of protest events per PRIO-GRID-month. Based on moving window analysis, we shift time sub-sequences with Dynamic Time Warping, which yields a more accurate measure of similarity between series. Using the k-Means algorithm, we extract clusters of similar time series, and assign every observation in the data to one cluster. This reveals common patterns in sequences of protest events. In support of our theoretical expectations, including these clusters as additional covariates in the ARIMA model improves out-of-sample performance.	NA
2023	1961	M02	Dynamics and Between-Within Estimators	This paper extends insights from the class of between-within estimators to account for dynamics/serial correlation in two distinct ways: non-iid error structures and distributed lag concerns. Starting with Mundlak (Econometrica 1978) and reinvigorated in the class of multi-level models in a series of papers by (all or subsets of) K. Jones, A. Bell, and M. Fairbrother and others, the ability to separate what are nominally long-run [between] and short-run [within] for stationary panels of data has led to significant advancements in the analysis of panel data. To consider non-IID errors, the paper examines the deployment of ARMA error structures to study temporally dependent processes and compares the use of ARMA and GEE estimators for such problems. To consider more general dynamics in such models, the paper extends arguments regarding the desirability of distributed lag structures to this class of models. Rather than a focus on dynamics or heterogeneity, as is the modal approach to panel data at present, this method simultaneously account for dynamics and heterogeneity in reasonable T non-spatially correlated panel data.

2023	848	M02	When space is just a nuisance: a simple solution for spatial dependence	Spatial autocorrelation is an ubiquitous phenomenon in cross-sectional data that poses notable challenges for statistical inference since unmodeled spatial dependence can cause common econometric methods to produce biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. While political scientists so far predominantly rely on parametric spatial regression models, semiparametric spatial filtering techniques constitute a valuable alternative. By using the eigenfunction decomposition of a transformed connectivity matrix, the filtering approach generates a synthetic proxy variable from a linear combination of judiciously selected eigenvectors. This synthetic variable acts as a surrogate for omitted spatial effects and removes spatial autocorrelation from the model residuals. This study introduces eigenvector-based spatial filtering to political science and discusses its strengths and limitations in comparison to parametric spatial models. Analytical results and Monte Carlo simulations show that spatial filtering resolves spatial misspecification problems in regression models. Given the widespread use of cross-sectional data, spatial filtering is applicable to a great variety of empirical analyses where spillovers are not the main quantity of interest. A new R package facilitates the application of this technique.	NA
2023	1462	1462	Are Ideological and Partisan Affinities Correlated with Voters' Differentiated Support of Arms Deliveries? Insights from a Large-scale Survey Experiment in France and Germany	The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine puts arms deliveries into the spotlight of political attention of voters and parties in European countries. Parties have to (re)position themselves on the question whether and which types of arms are to be delivered to Ukraine – in the German party system, the former pacifist and notoriously anti-weapons export party, the Greens, now joins the conservatives/liberals in emphatically demanding arms deliveries to Ukraine. But we know little on the underlying preference structure of these parties’ voters. How do voters‘ attitudes to arms exports relate to deep underlying dimensions structuring party competition like the still dominant left-right axis? Is the current position-taking of parties reflecting the demands of voters‘ arms transfer preferences? We draw on vignette and conjoint experiments embedded in a unique, large-scale (N=6,600) survey implemented in Germany and France, shortly before the Russian invasion, experimentally varying normative, strategic and economic costs and benefits of stylized arms transfers. Then, we contrast voters' assessment of the aspects of weapons transfer with their locations at the left-right dimension as well with their vote intentions.	NA
2023	190	EU02	How to Construct Solidarity? Crafting Solidarity Discourses in Poland and Slovakia During the Ukrainian Crisis	The main purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast responses of Ukraine's neighbours before and during the crisis. I will focus on practices and discourses of Polish and Slovak politicians. Both countries have expressed steadfast support for Ukraine, and both have accepted many refugees fleeing from the war. However, while the Poles were criticizing Russia and blaming the Russian government for the war, some Slovaks were skeptic about NATO and willing to maintain amicable relations with Russia. Thus, comparing practices and discourses of these two neighbours of Ukraine will contribute to our understanding of solidarity building among NATO and EU members during a crisis. The paper tries to give an answer to three questions: i) What were the initial reactions of Poland and Slovakia; ii) How were Russian attacks portrayed by politicians in Poland and Slovakia?,and iii) How did politicians build solidarity with the EU and NATO during the crisis? To answer these questions, the paper uses speeches, interviews and statements of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers of Poland and Slovakia.	NA
2023	1973	EU02	Regional Inequality and European Fiscal Preferences in Times of Crisis. How Regional Wealth and Covid-19 Impact Shape Public Support for EU Risk Sharing	The Covid-19 pandemic has caused an economic collapse, leading to the largest European fiscal stimulus package to date, and has revived public debate on European fiscal integration policies. However, the effects of regional contexts on citizens’ opinions towards such policies remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this research analyses European citizens’ preferences towards multidimensional fiscal capacity instruments by combining regional-level indicators with data from a conjoint experiment conducted during the first wave of the pandemic in five countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands) with 8570 respondents from 87 regions. The results indicate that regional self-interest moderates individual preferences; citizens in poorer regions, or regions more affected by Covid-19, are more likely to support integration policies which are redistributive, tax the rich, avoid budgetary conditions and don’t apply fines and termination for non-compliance. Respondents in wealthier regions, however, are more likely to support packages with fines and termination. This suggests that when forming opinions on European fiscal integration, people are likely to favour what is best for their region and take into account the pandemic’s impact.	NA
2023	520	EU03	Supranational Redistribution and EU Support	Public policies have feedback effects on mass publics, by shaping and changing their political attitudes and behaviour. In particular, redistributive policies have been found to elicit government support and political trust. Yet, there is limited knowledge on the effect of supranational redistribution on EU support and trust respectively. This paper analyses the feedback effects on support and trust in the EU of three types of redistributive policies at the supranational level: unemployment benefit (EUBS), social benefit (ESBS) and NextGenEU. The first two policies are at the stage of agenda setting and aim at correcting social inequalities among EU citizens irrespective of their member state of residence, while the last one is already being implemented and addresses redistribution between member states in order to tackle the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and sustainability. I employ survey experiments in Italy and Spain, two countries with similar social and economic challenges but distinct proportions of Eurosceptic citizens. The paper finds that EUBS increases trust in the EU especially in the case of individuals in situations of economic vulnerability.	NA
2023	922	EU02	Solidarity on a divided continent: Perceptions of centre and periphery determine European citizens' willingness to help other EU countries	North and South, creditors and debtors, centre and periphery - all too often, the European Union is divided between the rich, ‘old’ member states of the centre and the poor, ‘new’ countries in the peripheries. The paper argues that citizens perceive such division, and that their fiscal solidarity with other EU countries is structured along a centre-periphery divide. Empirically, such a claim is investigated using Heckman-style probit modelling with sample selection for a pooled dataset of two surveys in 2020 and 2021 among citizens of 13 European countries by the European University Institute and YouGov. The results show that such a centre-periphery divide among citizens exist: Citizens in centre countries are more likely to express solidarity with other centre countries than with periphery countries, and vice versa. The findings show that citizens perceive the power hierarchy among EU member states and that there is a spatial-relational dimension to European fiscal solidarity.	NA
2023	1116	EU03	The Growing Educational Divide in Attitudes towards Public Institutions: The Case of the European Union	This paper examines the relationship between European institutional integration and EU support. We argue that the progressing trend of European institutional integration since the 1950s has made EU institutions increasingly visible and this visibility, in turn, has raised the probability that European institutions are identified as objects of blame. As a result, we expect that the more a country institutionally integrates on the European level, the more pronounced should the educational divide in EU support become. In particular, we expect that the lower educated should become increasingly skeptical of membership in the EU compared to the higher educated. Applying a Bayesian mixed-effects modeling approach that draws on 85 waves of the Eurobarometer survey in EU-15 countries covering more than 820.000 respondents between 1976 and 2014, we show that the gap between low and high educated citizens in support for EU membership widens substantially with a country’s level of European institutional integration. Beyond the European context, we believe that our findings have important implications for the growing educational divide in attitudes towards public institutions in developed democracies.	NA
2023	1376	EU03	European Identity and Migration Attitudes	Identity matters for explaining attitudes towards the EU and migration. But how? Existing literature often builds on a binary conceptualization of European identity, distinguishing between EU citizens that have integrated some (not specified) form of a European identity and those who have exclusively national identities. Not surprisingly, empirical studies show that exclusive national identities correlate with preferences for more restrictive migration policies. However, this analytical set-up ignores the multidimensionality of both identity and migration policy. We use a more nuanced framework of identity, which (a) distinguishes between civic and cultural dimensions of European identity and (b) varies in how citizens evaluate their in-group vis-à-vis the out-group. By relating this conceptualization of identity to EU migration attitudes, we predict whom one prefers as a migrant coming to Europe. We present results from our survey, including a conjoint experiment, evaluating the links between respondents' European identity and their preferences regarding different types of migrants in seven European countries. The findings on how identity relates to migration attitudes have important implications for the challenges of EU migration policy.	NA
2023	1521	EU03	Why Do Europeans Like or Dislike the European Union? A Comparative Reappraisal of Individual-Level Determinants of Political Support for the EU in the Absence of a European Demos	Postfunctionalist arguments emphasizing the conflict between identity and supranational integration populate the core of contemporary scholarly debate on political support for the EU. However, evidence suggests that while identification with a European polity remains consistently low, support for EU membership is remarkably higher and in an increasing trajectory since the Great Recession; support for integration appears to exist in absence of a European demos. This arguably elicits a revisitation of extant mainstream scholarship on EU political attitudes. To do so, this paper provides a comparative assessment of the main predictors of diffuse political support for the EU, drawing on original large-N survey data collected yearly in 16 EU member-states since 2018. An embedded vignette experiment will measure the effect of security, economic and cultural frames of EU integration on EU political support. Firstly, I find that attitudes towards the EU are more strongly predicted by utilitarian expectations of economic prosperity derived from EU membership than by identity or national security concerns. Secondly, I ascertain that positive economic frames generate the strongest effect in political support for the EU.	NA
2023	4	EU03	The Emergence of a European Public Mind: Shared Opinion Dynamics in Post-War Europe	Do European mass publics respond similarly when asked their views about the European Union and European integration? We employ a novel approach to unearthing evidence of a common European public by investigating the common dynamic properties of public opinion across six EU member states. Specifically, we use a Bayesian State-Space model to estimate a common component in public opinion related to EU politics and EU integration, over seven decades. The results indicate that changes in public opinion do not exclusively reflect national dynamics –we find evidence of a common European factor that underlies changes in public opinion about the EU, providing the first evidence ever for a transnational opinion cycle. However, the common factor only emerged over time. While country-specific factors were dominant in shaping fluctuations in public opinion before the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, a common European component became dominant in the period after. We further find that co-movement in public opinion about Europe has historically been strongest in Italy and France, while Danish public’s opinion dynamics have run counter to those of fellow member states.

2023	964	EU03	The Endogeneity of Institutional Preferences: Citizens' Attitudes on EU Treaty Reforms	Is institutional change driven by preferences over policy outputs or by procedural legitimacy concerns? This is a crucial issue for contemporary international organisations, whose institutional designs are currently under pressure. We test the institutional endogeneity hypothesis via a multi-country conjoint experiment fielded in 16 European Union member states. We further probe procedural legitimacy concerns via in-depth exploration of heterogeneous effects, relying on methodological advances such as Bayesian finite mixture models. Our results suggest that respondents' institutional reform preferences are conditional on their getting their favoured policy outcomes. We also discover a viable bargaining solution that could break the current impasse over EU Treaty reform, currently high on the political agenda.	NA
2023	1145	EU04	Committing To A Common Response? Understanding Integration Processes In Migration And Energy After The Invasion Of Ukraine	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has reinvigorated interest in theories of European integration. Most early accounts highlight alignment and coordination without institutional integration. Below the surface, however, the war sparked temporal inversions of member states’ attitudes towards integration of refugee and energy policy, which highlight underappreciated integration mechanisms. In migration, we have seen the rapid and uncontroversial activation of the Temporary Protection Directive, a supranational instrument that, while pre-existing, had been widely considered dead letter. The supranational but flexible solution offered by the Directive enabled a rapid response and practical solidarity rather than presenting a stumbling block, unlike in previous refugee crises. In energy policy, a temporal inversion of positions is opening a window of opportunity in a field previously marked by deadlock. However, changes in both areas were seemingly not driven by regularly identified integration mechanisms (increased solidarity or issue linkage to overcome disagreement). Tracing EU-level negotiations and the evolving preferences of key member states, this paper argues that, next to efficiency gains and exogenous security threats, time-inconsistencies and credible commitments are crucial to explain these developments.

2023	342	EU05	Policy complexity, transposition delay and implementation performance in the European Union	How does the complexity of EU directives affect their transposition and implementation at the national level? The answers of the EU implementation literature to this question are quite mixed. We argue that those inconclusive findings are not only due to varying methodological choices and different data foundations, but also result from a rather narrow conceptual understanding of complexity. In this study, we make the case that the complexity of a directive is not only determined by its scope, as existing research suggests, but also results from how the directive is formulated (linguistic complexity) and how interdependent its legal provisions are (relational complexity). The core question we address in this study is whether different types of complexity have different effects on implementation performance in the EU member states. Empirically, we combine several data sources to evaluate the impact of directive complexity on transposition delays and infringement proceedings, following the adoption of roughly 1,000 EU directives between 1993 and 2021. The analysis yields new insights into how complexity-induced costs of compliance affect the performance of EU member states at the implementation stage.	NA
2023	363	EU05	The Dance of European Integration: Ideology, Self-Interest and Responsiveness	What explains support for European Integration? Why did people on the Left oppose, and Right support, European Integration in the 1980s, but this pattern reverse in the 2020s? In contrast to the common account of European Integration as a new ‘cleavage’ in European politics, on a par with class, religion, and geography, we argue that citizens evaluate European Integration by what it has on offer for them. If Europe offers them a policy-bundle in line with their own (left-right) preferences, they support it. If not, they are opposed. In turn, the EU adjusts its policy-mix in response to what the EU expects the public demands. Although sometimes out of tune, support for European Integration is a dance between the public self-interested assessment of Europe’s policy-mix supply and Europe’s responsiveness to the public’s policy-mix demand. We test this theory using individual-level public opinion data from all EU member states since the mid 1970s and a novel method for measuring the left-right policy location of EU legislative outputs over time.

2023	421	EU05	Shifting rhetorics of international order among European leaders	The EU is both an offspring and a main pillar of the 'liberal international order' (LIO). Nevertheless, the EU seemingly became wary of the LIO in recent years. Given the increasing rivalry with China, the uncertain transatlantic relationship, Russia’s irredentism, and European citizens’ scepticism of globalization, European political leaders have increasingly engaged in a discourse centred on sovereignty, autonomy, and protection. Our paper investigates how and for which reasons leaders have accommodated the tension between the universalism of the LIO and the particularism of the 'sovereign territorial order' (STO). We argue that the European political space, where boundaries can be erected on either the national or the supranational level, enables two further mixed understandings of international order, namely 'national liberalism' and 'supranational sovereigntism'. Methodologically, we use latent semantic scaling (Watanabe 2021) and apply it to the EUSpeech corpus (Schumacher et al. 2020) to classify speeches along the two dimensions of universal versus particularistic values, and supranational versus national authority. Our paper contributes to studies on the rebordering of European integration and the crisis of the LIO.	NA
2023	567	EU05	Don't put all your eggs in one basket: Functional Pressure, Political Control and Issue Importance for European Integration	European integration stopped being a dichotomous phenomenon a long time ago. The resulting Europeanization à la carte has led to citizens having different perceptions as to how important a certain policy domain is for the relationships between European countries. Despite this distinction made by the public, only few studies investigated issue importance of European integration across policy domains and even less the underlying reasons. In this paper, we argue that public’s assigned relevance of integration in specific policy domains is influenced by characteristics of these domains. First, functional pressures of scale drive issue importance of EU integration with the hope that respective policy areas might be more effectively and efficiently realized when integrated. Second, political parties’ preferences to address certain issues indicates to which degree citizens give importance to this issue for EU integration. Empirically, we analyze public’s assigned importance to six policy domains for future integration between the EU and its neighboring European non-members. For this, we collected survey data in eight EU and non-EU countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) in 2021.	NA
2023	2007	IP05	Political Opposition to Foreign Home Ownership	Real estate prices have increased in recent years across the OECD, and at least some of this increase is due to non-resident purchases of real estate from abroad. How do governments respond to these trends? We show that governments can restrict entry into the real estate market, and we uncover the political incentives for citizens to demand and governments to impose these restrictions. We argue that citizens demand restrictions to maintain affordable housing, especially where housing prices have increased the most, as a strategy to secure their retirement savings, and when they lack access to family support for real estate purchases. We further argue that democratic governments, who are more responsive to citizen demands, are more likely to impose these restrictions, while countries with many constraints on executive actions are less likely to impose them. To evaluate our theoretical propositions, we present a new database documenting restrictions on the transactions of non-residents over time and across countries. We also draw on a survey experiment that analyzes the support for these measures on non-resident real estate ownership to corroborate our argument.	NA
2023	656	IP05	Adapt, Expand and Restructure: A Comparative Perspective of Multilateral Development Banks’ Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis	The COVID-19 crisis has increased pressures on international organizations and on multilateral development banks (MDBs) in particular. Consequently, MDBs need to deal with various negative implications of the pandemic, such as resource cuts and scenarios of increased forum shopping for cheap crisis-response capital. In other cases, MDBs benefit from crises and seize the opportunity to expand their scope, policy instruments and/or introduce structural reforms. Consequently, when and how MDBs use crisis as an opportunity to adapt, reform, and/or expand their scope of operations. Furthermore, how IOs respond to different global crises, and what are the factors that determine whether they can transform these into real opportunities for growth and reform. I argue that in times of crisis, variation in MDBs’ institutional design affects their ability to expand their scope of operations and initiate reforms. To test this hypothesis, I conduct a focused, structured comparison of twelve MDBs, since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020 and examine their policy responses in the first two years of the pandemic.

2023	742	IP05	Business Migration in the Shadow of Politicization: The Case of Switzerland	Amid high levels of politicization of immigration issues, Western countries seem to be shifting towards forms of migration that are less visible and -as a consequence- less contentious. This paper explores one such form of “back-door” migration: business mobility in Switzerland. Designed for temporary stays in multinational companies or as contractual service suppliers, and usually retaining the work contract in the country of origin, business mobility eludes ordinary immigration statistics and public attention. Using a combination of original survey and administrative data we start by describing the volume, characteristics and evolution of business mobility as compared to other forms of third country labor migration in the last decade. After establishing its quantitative importance, we explore the regulations facilitating this “back-door” migration in domestic and international law. We show that contrary to the otherwise restrictive provisions for the entry of third country nationals in Switzerland, business migrants benefit from numerous facilitations in national law and under preferential trade agreements. The last part of the paper therefore examines the effects of these regulatory facilitations on migration flows using econometric analysis.	NA
2023	1043	GD06	Inspiring Britons: Exploring symbolic representation in Britain using heroes and role models	While the importance of symbolic representation is downplayed in political representation literature (Pitkin 1967), the importance of visible presence of people from under-represented groups in public and political sphere for redressing political grievances and social exclusion is widely accepted (e.g., Phillips 1998; Mansbridge 1999). Even as token representation, inspirational persons (often understood as heroes and role models) can uplift and motivate historically marginalised groups such as women, ethnic minorities, young people. Based on the 2021 YouGov survey recording the range of inspirational persons and preferences for their key characteristics linked, this paper explores the pool of inspirational persons and their desired characteristics in Britain. It also examines how closely this range of persons resemble the socio-demographic composition of the country and tests for in-group preference for heroes and role models for women and ethnic minority Britons.

2023	14	GD10	Descriptive representation and performance evaluations of political institutions	How does descriptive representation affect citizens’ perceptions of political decision-making? Recent studies have shown that descriptive representation impacts two distinct types of considerations that citizens make when they observe a decision-making process: 1) substantive considerations and 2) procedural considerations. Citizens first ask themselves whether a policy output is congruent with their individual political and policy preferences. And second, citizens assess whether the decision-making procedures were fair and proper, potentially affecting their satisfaction with democratic institutions. In our research, we design experimental survey vignettes that focus on the descriptive representation of women, and we look at different policy areas where there is significant policy variation across countries and where the policy positions of members of both our in-group, women, and out-group, men, are likely to vary. We also look at the effects multiple levels of descriptive representation (including overrepresentation), and the effect of descriptive representation on respondents who belong to the in-group but who are not directly affected by a policy.

2023	180	GD10	Will She Run? Role Models Events, Informational Content and Women’s Political Ambition	The gender-gap in political ambition remains a constant today even though women and men are now engaging in other types of political participation at the same rates. Research suggests that seeing women running for office in the real-world might increase other women's political ambition (e.g., Wolbrecht & Campbell, 2007). This phenomenon is called Role-Model Effect. Parties and organisations interested in increasing women's political representation started recreating this effect in the artificial environment of Mentoring Events where female political actors meet women non-political actors. Research investigating the effectiveness of mentoring events produced mixed findings (Foos and Gilardi, 2020). I argue that in mentoring events, role-model effect is much more connected to what the role models say in a short amount of time compared to real-world role-model effect. I run a survey experiment to separate the effect of role models’ speeches from their “presence” in the room. I tested the effect of eight treatments based on real-life mentoring events on a representative sample of the British population. Findings have both practical and theoretical implications for the topic of women’s political ambition.	NA
2023	795	GD10	Gender Roles, Perspectives, and Issue Attention in the Italian Digital Arena	Political parties and national assemblies are often described as gendered institutions where power is distributed to women’s detriment. We test this claim by shifting attention from the real to the digital political arena, to explore whether the net is a friendlier environment for female politicians. Relying on a novel dataset on Italian parliamentarians' tweets from January 2020 to February 2022, we employ network analysis to assess the shape and dynamics of inter- and intra-party networks, and we use structural topic models to compare politicians’ issue-attention across a variety of politically relevant topics. Our results show women are as well-connected and as active as men, and tweet on a wide range of topics. Furthermore, women draw attention to the sub-issues they care the most when discussing the same topics addressed by men, which signal women's intention to bring their own perspective in the political debate. Our analysis thus suggests the net is indeed a friendlier environment than more conventional political arenas, where women numeric under-representation, their appointment to more marginal positions, and gender gaps in issue attention are still detectable.

2023	997	GD10	Gender Equality Attitudes in the EU: Assessing the Effect of the EU Policymaking	A threat of anti-gender backlash and its connection to the broader phenomenon of illiberalism in Europe calls for a more detailed look into the public approval of gender equality. Contrary to the proponents of the modernisation theory, the global value change towards post-materialist values has been hampered by citizens’ resistance and counteractions of (right-wing) populist actors in several EU countries. Insofar research has investigated the individual-level effects and country-level differences but overlooked the EU aspect, namely the impact of specific EU gender mainstreaming policies. Previous literature on cross-country divergence in the EU has found that such factors as the religious composition and the degree of modernisation can successfully explain this internal divergence. Proponents of the neo-institutionalist approach have also analysed the effect of EU policymaking, although only a few studies successfully quantify this parameter. Using data from the most recent round of the European Values Survey, this paper investigates the effects of EU policymaking on gender equality attitudes in the EU. The multi-level analysis provides empirical evidence on the causal mechanisms of European efforts on citizens’ attitudes.	NA
2023	1547	GD09	Just like me - Evidence on Group-Cue Based Voting from Germany	Do citizens consider candidates' social group characteristics when casting their vote? The lack of candidate diversity and descriptive under-representation of groups such as ethnic minorities, females, young or working class people in parliaments is a common issue in public and scholarly debate. However, existing studies on whether this makes people more likely to vote for candidates that increase their own group's representation in parliament yield mixed results. Examining voters usage of group cues in the German parliament election in 2021, we provide new evidence against this mechanism. Specifically, we collected data on all candidates' group characteristics to match those with group memberships of survey respondents. We found that age, gender and occupational cues do not significantly alter voting decisions in the candidate vote. This indicates voters' concerns about diversity in parliaments and a lack of their in-group's representation is only secondary to issue or ideological voting.	NA
2023	1603	GD09	Exploring the Relationship between Gender Equality, Polarization, and Voting Behavior in Europe	As women's empowerment advances, many countries face growing opposition to measures for greater gender equality, particularly from conservative and populist radical right parties and actors. This has led to the politicization of gender issues. However, little is known about the extent to which these issues divide European societies. This is surprising, since a growing body of literature focuses on the levels of issue polarization. To address this gap, this study employs a unique approach to measuring levels of support and opposition for gender equality, and the extent to which this issue polarizes affectively. Using original survey data collected in ten European countries in autumn 2022, this paper maps the division around the issue across Europe and analyzes how different stances on state measures for more gender equality relate to voting behavior. This study adds to the literature by providing a theoretical link between polarization and gender equality and by introducing a new approach to measure polarization of issues. The empirical findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between gender equality, politicization, and polarization in Europe.	NA
2023	347	GD09	Cryptocurrency and Sexism: Masculinity and Politics among young men	In general, young people in the US exhibit more liberal political attitudes than older Americans across a wide variety of issues, and are more likely to support left-leaning candidates in elections. At the same time, young people in the US and worldwide are much more likely to express non-traditional gender identities than older cohorts. Using general population telephone surveys and targeted online surveys as well as priming experiments, the studies presented here look at the extent to which liberal socio-political views among young people are driven by non-traditional gender identities. The implication explored here is that young people who assert very traditional masculine or feminine gender identities are not more likely to be liberal, and are finding new ways to use political and social activities to express their gender identities. This includes traits like sexism and vote choice, but also activities, like buying an owning cryptocurrency, that are strongly linked to political attitudes among young men.	NA
2023	877	GD09	The Impact of Sex and Gender Identity on Voting for the Populist Radical Right	Existing research demonstrates a gender gap in populist radical right voting. We know that men are more likely to cast their vote for a populist radical right party compared to women. However, most studies actually analyze the impact of the biological sex of the voters and do not take their gender into account. The effect of both sex and gender, as two distinct concepts, so far is understudied. To shed light on the impact of sex and gender identity on voting for the populist radical right, this study utilizes an original survey among 2,764 voters conducted in the context of the general election 2021 in Germany. The findings demonstrate that both sex and gender identity affect populist radical right voting. Women are less likely to vote for the radical right compared to men. Additionally, voters that strongly identify with male traits are more likely to vote for the radical right.	NA
2023	879	GD09	Women as Agents of Change: How has women's political mobilization restructured political networks and changed local governance?	How does women’s political inclusion alter the nature of political organization? In 2004, women in India’s state of Bihar were 12% points less likely to vote than men, but by 2019 they voted 5% points more than men. Are these women mobilized into the same patriarchal, clientelist and caste-based systems that mobilize men? Or does their political inclusion reshape relationships of political exchange and generate more programmatic politics? We use data from a novel census in 12 villages in Bihar to map political networks and the nature of gendered political mobilization. We find rural Indian political networks are segregated by gender and women have less access to male-dominated clientelist networks, but, conditional on access, also engage less in such relationships. While many women are passively mobilized by men in their households to amplify household voting power, women who do find their way into politics must do so via collective action to articulate programmatic demands. These results elucidate the strategic incentives to suppress women’s political participation and demonstrate how women’s political exclusion is built on clientelist systems.	NA
2023	1230	GD02	But is she married? Assessing information-seeking about female politicians	What citizens know and learn about female politicians is crucial for the success of women in politics: Information mediates whether citizens judge candidates on their characteristics or use stereotypes in their assessment, often relying on candidate gender as a heuristic. However, it is unclear how citizens acquire such information. Addressing this, I differentiate gendered information availability and gendered patterns of information-seeking. I argue that due to the incongruence of leadership and gender stereotypes, citizens seek more information about female politicians. However, this information-seeking occurs along stereotypical lines. As a result, it may reinforce existing stereotypes about women in politics. I test this argument based on digital trace data from Wikipedia covering 1500 legislators over two years. Drawing on page views as well as users’ click-paths, I show that Wikipedia users search for more information on female politicians, however, their interest is centered on family and personal life, rather than policy positions. Thereby, the paper presents a novel approach to the study of perceptions of politicians that allows cross-national and over-time comparisons of political information-seeking at a low cost.	NA
2023	1327	GD08	The Influence of Mental Load Priming on Men's and Women's Intentions to Participate in Public Life	How does cognitive household labor -- the mental work involved in anticipating, fulfilling, and monitoring household needs -- influence men's and women's decisions about whether and how to participate in public life? Previous studies suggest that women take on the vast majority of such mental work. We theorize that because this often invisible form of unpaid labor is constantly on women’s, but not men’s, minds, priming the mental load will have distinct influences on men versus women. We expect that men asked to think about their cognitive household “to do” list will subsequently express less interest in political participation and workplace advancement. However, because women already factor the mental load into decisions about whether and how to participate in public life, we posit that women will show no significant change in their political and workplace preferences as a result of this priming. We test this argument with a preregistered survey experiment in the United States manipulating the salience of cognitive household labor tasks. Our results offer new insights on the relevance of household-based inequalities to gender equality in public life.	NA
2023	1343	GD08	Gendered conceptions of political visibility and how they shape women’s political participation on the internet: Exploring attitudinal and behavioral dimensions of gender norms in the digital sphere	Over the past decades new gender gaps in political participation emerged against the backdrop of digitalization: Women appear to abstain when it comes to online political activities that are explicitly meant to be seen by others. By relating the aspect of political visibility to an understanding of gender that allocates women in the private sphere, we theorize that internal attitudinal and external behavioral measures of conservative views on gender norms help explain this gap. To this end, we analyze the impact of individual’s attitudes towards women’s visibility in the public sphere as well as their observations of and experiences with hateful speech on the internet. Visible political participation is measured as the sharing of and commenting on political content online. Based on telephone survey data from 2021 with a probability sample (n = 1,595), we show how gender differences in these activities can be traced back to conservative conceptions of gender norms of political visibility, and discuss the chances and challenges that future studies of attitudinal and behavioral gender norms in gender and participation research should consider.

2023	229	GD08	Social Action and the Ballot Box: The moderating effect of Gender on the relationship between Volunteering and First-time Voter Turnout	Volunteering has long been identified as an intervention in the political socialisation of children and young people that can encourage them to engage with and participate in their communities in a variety of other ways, such as through voting. Recent research increasingly shows, however, that this effect is frequently exaggerated and limited to the minority of young volunteers raised in politically disengaged households and otherwise unlikely to be socialised into being politically active. This research brings in gender - as an institution that structures political socialisation - and considers whether and how it moderates the effect of volunteering on the political engagement and behaviour of young people. The analysis shows that the positive effects of volunteering are limited almost entirely to young men, which is argued to reflect the impact of the gendered nature of political socialisation on the type of volunteer activity typically engaged in by young men and women. The paper argues that while volunteering can reduce socio-economic inequalities in first-time voter turnout, this is only the case for men.	NA
2023	1516	GD07	Striking back: The impact of a football club’s progressive campaigns on fans’ sexist and racist attitudes	Strong group consciousness is often associated with discriminatory attitudes towards out-groups. Sports teams are not explicitly political organizations; yet they promote strong group consciousness. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, football stadiums are often the setting of racist and sexist altercations. But can initiatives led by a sport’s team change this? Through a partnership with Bahia Football Club, we employ two survey experiments (N = 1,804 and N = 2,189) to explore whether the Club’s anti-racism and anti-sexism initiatives have an impact on their fans’ attitudes towards Afro-Brazilians and women. We find that the Club’s anti-racism initiatives are well-evaluated by fans but have null effects on their attitudes; meanwhile, the anti-sexism initiatives seeking to make football more welcoming to women backfire: the initiative not only prompts respondents to display more sexist attitudes, but also to more negatively evaluate the Club and its efforts to promote equality and inclusion in other areas.

2023	1586	GD07	The (Re-)Politicisation of Gender Equality: The Role of Social Threat and Political Ideology	Western societies have witnessed decades of secular improvements in gender equality. Females’ gains in education and governments’ affirmative actions were the main driver towards more gender equality. More recently, political actors, often but not only from right-wing populist parties, claim that governments’ action to foster equality between the sexes have gone too far or should at least be ended – because there is no longer any inequality between men and women. Substantial parts of Western populations agree with this. Using survey data from four online surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022 as part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we examine who favours and who opposes state action in favour of gender equality. We argue that a right-wing political ideology and the social threat that comes along with the perception that governments’ affirmative action produces “winners” and “losers” are the major sources of attitudes on state anti-inequality measures and examine how these rival explanations interact. We show that women utter the most support. While political orientation is a stronger predictor than socio-economic indicators, which is especially the case for men.	NA
2023	393	GD07	Counter-Stereotypes and Attitudes Toward Gender and LGBTQ Equality	Insights from social psychology and the gender and politics literature suggest that exposure to counter-stereotypes about gender roles might improve people's attitudes toward gender equality and LGBTQ rights. We test this expectation by conducting a series of five survey experiments (N=6,916) and a separate follow-up experiment (N=3,600) using counter-stereotypical treatments commonly encountered in the real world. We examine both political and non-political attitudes, manipulate stereotypes about both men and women, and provide visual as well as textual stimuli. The treatments undermined stereotypes about the gender roles depicted in the counter-stereotypical exemplars. However, they failed to alter respondents' generic core beliefs about women and men and increase equitable attitudes. The results improve our understanding of how stereotypes contribute to gender and anti-LGBTQ bias.	NA

Drawing on an original survey conducted at a moment of peak perceived polarisation in Brazilian society (Oct 2022), we test how perceived gender and political identity affect how close people feel towards others in society, and how these variables interact. We also assess the role of gender salience and citizens' agreement with or questioning of traditional gender stereotypes. The study has been pre-registered.	NA
2023	920	PC07	Can influencers be political? Exploring the role of influencers in promoting views about feminism /sexism	The relevance of influencers in the social media has dramatically increased. Influencers enjoy massive on line audiences and are perceived by their followers as reliable specialists in their pitches. This gives influencers the opportunity to impact their audience’s purchasing decisions. Although overlooked by scholarship, this is also the perfect scenario to become digital opinion leaders. While the commercial power of influencers is obvious, we still know very few about their capacity to impact public opinion. This paper aims to contribute to our scarce knowledge about the role of influencers in promoting attitudes and opinions about feminism and gender inequalities. We are collecting representative survey evidence in Spain including information about the exposure of participants to a number of influencers in Spain and their opinions and attitudes on gender inequalities. We complement this evidence with content analysis of the digital information influencers post (including texts, pictures, and videos) during the field work of the survey. We contribute to an incipient line of research studying the role influencers play in public discourse and opinion formation through their social media accounts.	NA
2023	1023	GD06	Give Me Your Christian, Your Manly, Your Abled: Exclusive Visions of Nationality and Belonging	Are Americans likely to support some refugees, but not others, in their bid for entry into the United States? In this paper, we argue that (1) refugee identity and (2) respondents' beliefs about identity shape support for granting entry to refugees. First, we hypothesize that Americans will express different levels of support towards refugees based on their gender, sexuality, state of origin, religion, and ability status. Second, we hypothesize that respondents' beliefs about religious, ethnic, gendered, and abled criteria for ``true Americanness'---i.e. ethnocultural forms of nationalism---will further shape their attitudes towards granting refugees entry. We examine these expectations using a pre-registered conjoint survey experiment with a diverse national sample of more than 3,000 American respondents. Our findings support our expectations that Americans use a diverse set of ethnocultural forms of nationalism to form their support for refugee entry and suggest that categorical exclusions stemming from ethnocultural nationalism attitudes are more widespread than prior studies have shown.

2023	1594	GD06	The electoral effects of elite-led anti-LGBTQ mobilization	Does elite-led anti-LGBTQ mobilization bolster the electoral fortunes of the radical right? While a growing body of literature documents the increasing politicization of LGBTQ- and gender-related issues by conservative elites, few studies have analyzed the electoral effects of these strategies. In particular, whether legal acts of social exclusion activate and mobilize supporters of radical right parties, remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we study the adoption of anti-LGBTQ resolutions in many Polish municipalities prior to the 2019 parliamentary and 2020 presidential elections. Our empirical strategy relies on a synthetic difference-in-differences estimator, and finds no clear evidence that anti-LGBTQ resolutions increased the support for the radical right Law and Justice party in the parliamentary elections. To the contrary, the evidence from the subsequent presidential election suggests that anti-LGBTQ resolutions mobilized support for the opposed Civic Platform. Overall, this study's findings are relevant for understanding the electoral consequences of elite-led mobilization against stigmatized or discriminated groups, as well as the politics of social exclusion more broadly.

2023	1622	GD06	Intragroup Empathy toward a Disadvantaged group member	To adapt to advantaged-group environments, disadvantaged group members may adopt advantaged-group signs, which may hinder disadvantaged intragroup empathy(DIE). Yet, little is known about the nature of this impairment. In a series of studies, we examined contextual variables shaping DIE: (a) examined the effects of the reason behind adopting advantaged signs on empathic measures following a negative outcome, N=183 (b) the effects of the reason following a positive outcome, N=205 (c) and the interaction between a negative encounter with an advantaged member and reason, N=282. We hypothesized that adopting advantaged-group signs willingly will decrease perceived DIE compared to coercively adopting the signs. Also, a negative encounter with an advantaged-group member increases DIE. Palestinian students were assigned to read scripts depicting the academic experience of a Palestinian student who adopted advantaged-group signs and then rated empathic measures. Findings show that participants in the willing condition experienced reduced intragroup empathy compared to the coercive. Moreover, a negative encounter with an advantaged-group member increased DIE. This research expands our understanding of disadvantaged intragroup empathy and serves to develop intervention tools to preserve DIE.	NA
2023	1982	GD06	Identity Expression and Stability in Incentivized Economic Games	From the 2010 to the 2020 census, the percentage of the U.S. population who reported multiple races more than tripled, jumping from 2.9% to 10.2%, with a marked increase in minority races. One explanation for this unprecedented increase is owed to better measures of race and ethnicity in the U.S. census. However, a complementary explanation is that some Whites may perceive it as advantageous to report an additional race or ethnicity. We test this hypothesis using economic games where White participants are randomly paired with a stranger who reported being White or Black. In the first study, participants play incentivized economic games that measure a wide range of behaviors. In the second study, we give the opportunity to one racial group (but not others) to earn additional money and we allow participants to report an additional race to be eligible for the additional earnings.

2023	480	GD06	The Effect of Muslim Immigration on Natives' Attitudes in the Traditional Morality Dimension	Existing literature on immigration in Europe mainly focuses on immigrants' effects on natives' attitudes in the economic dimension and on attitudinal outcomes related to national identity. It substantially neglects natives' attitudes on traditional morality issues, such as gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights. In this paper, I study how exposure to culturally conservative outgroups, such as Muslim immigrants, affects progressive attitudes of the ingroup on traditional morality issues. Using a survey experiment, I contribute in two ways. First, I study whether 'self-categorization' - id est, the polarization of natives' progressive attitudes on traditional morality issues as a mechanism to reinforce ingroup-outgroup boundaries (Dancygier, 2017) - takes place even when natives' reference point is not culturally progressive. Second, I test a possible complementary mechanism - 'cognitive dissonance' - arguing that natives, especially left-wing and progressive natives, may overstress their progressive attitudes in the traditional morality dimension to compensate for higher negative attitudes towards immigrants and multiculturalism when exposed to Muslim immigrants. Moreover, I contribute to existing literature testing my theory also on newly emerging traditional morality issues, such as gender self-identification.	NA
2023	582	PC09	Information Architecture for Corruption Messaging: Evidence from an Adaptive Experiment	The presentation and framing of information is an important foundation of many behavioral experiments. We evaluate two strategies for identifying the message frames that optimize subject engagement. Results are presented from a ``static'' online experiments in which subjects are randomly assigned to evaluate differently framed malfeasance messaging videos with the identical information. Subjects were more persuaded by a temporal as opposed to spatial comparison and responded more positively when malfeasance loses were expressed in terms of municipal spending on influenza vaccines. We implemented a second adaptive experiment in which the assignment probabilities of video messages were updated in 11 batches of 100 subjects each using a modified Thompson Sampling algorithm. The results are less conclusive regarding optimal framing of malfeasance messages -- video message treatments fare quite differently depending on the outcome metric.	NA
2023	792	PC09	The Passion vs. Content Trade-Off in Political Speech: A Computational Analysis of Video Recordings of Parliamentary Debates	Political speech has central importance for democracy and democratic deliberation. From a normative perspective, two properties of political speech are in a strained relationship: passion and content. Passionate political speech is desirable because it makes voters more likely to listen and engage with political messages. Content is desirable because democratic deliberation only works through an exchange of informed arguments. The relationship between passion and content gains tension if passionate speech comes at the cost of textual sparseness. In this study, I examine the relationship between passion and content in political speech from an empirical perspective. I computationally analyze a large body of video recordings and transcripts of parliamentary debates in the German Bundestag (2011—2020). I use video recordings to measure passion in legislative speech and transcripts to assess speeches' textual informativeness. Preliminary findings suggest that passionate delivery does not rule out informed argumentation, nor does dry delivery guarantee textual richness. Still, passionately conducted debates are usually less complex than more formal discussions. This suggests that legislators use parliamentary debates for varying purposes and adjust their delivery accordingly.	NA
2023	1253	PC17	Never gonna give you up: Analysing party responsiveness to vote loss to other parties in five European democracies	Long-term party ties in the electorate continue to diminish. Voters no longer vote for the same party in every election; instead, shifts in voting are becoming increasingly common. To regain lost votes, parties have incentives to respond to this volatility. However, studies taking concrete vote loss into account are scarce. From a saliency perspective, we argue that if a party loses a considerable fraction of voters to another party, it will try and win these voters back by putting more emphasis on the issues that were most salient for the competing party. To test this assumption, we focus on national parties in five European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Spain) within a multi-level regression analysis. We analyse issue salience based on tweets of the party accounts to capture short-term tactical party agendas. With a naive Bayes classifier trained on manifesto data, we use an innovative approach of topic-coding the tweets under study. Our results help better understand in how far parties are responsive to shifts in their voter base and thus how responsiveness and vote loss are connected.	NA
2023	1677	PC17	Personalization and Twitter: How do content recommendations respond to ideological behavior?	Although social media only recently emerged, the accumulation of evidence undermining the ‘echo chamber’ hypothesis is striking. While self-selective exposure to congruent content - the echo chamber - is not as salient as expected, the ideological bias induced primarily by algorithmic selection - the filter bubble - has been less scrutinized. In this study, we propose a new experimental research design to investigate recommender systems. We rely on automated agents, which 'treat' the algorithm with ideological and behavioral cues. For each agent, we compare the recommended timeline and the artificially reconstructed chronological timeline to isolate the amplification bias of the recommender. We investigate two main questions : (1) how much bias is induced by the recommender system? (2) what role do implicit and explicit cues play? The experiment features 170 automated agents, active for six weeks before and after the 2020 American presidential election. We find that, after three weeks of delivering ideological cues, the average amplification bias is 5%. Implicit cues - interacting with the content- play a much more important role than explicit ones (following accounts).	NA
2023	1856	PC17	Wisdom of the Sub-Crowds: Partisan-Based Measurement of Online Polarization	Interactions on social media are plagued with polarizing or divisive language. However, very few studies are able to measure it in a satisfactory way. Previous work bases such classification tasks on sentiment analysis via dictionaries or machine-learning methods, assuming that divisiveness is perceived in a uniform way by everyone observing social media interactions. This project aims to improve social media output measurement using group-specific labelling of textual data. We train three different classifiers based on the coders’ partisan identity: Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. We then apply these human-classifiers to unseen tweets. Finally, we repeat the process using a pre-trained Q&A machine-learning model, and use it as a benchmark for human coders. The four coded sets of tweets are compared across time and topics. This procedure allows us to test whether human-coders use their in-group identity to evaluate (and label) public discourse, and if and how machines deviate from each partisan group.	NA
2023	979	PC17	Not their election, still a reaction: How legislators in multi-level systems engage with first- and second-order elections	In multilevel systems, sub-national and supra-national elections are often considered second order. Yet, what does it mean for second-order MPs if a first-order election occurs and vice versa? In this paper, I find an answer to this question by analyzing the online political communication of German MPs and how it was affected by federal-level, state-level and EU-level election campaigns. Theoretically, I draw from two strands of literature. On the one hand, I refer to the campaigning and electoral circle literature to show how MPs respond to approaching elections. On the other hand, I use the literature on multilevel systems focusing on the effects of the first and second-order status of legislatures. To answer the research question, I analyze the usage of emotional language, regional references and specific campaign-related content in the Twitter communication of all MPs in the German federal parliament (Bundestag), the sixteen state-level parliaments (Landtage), and the German representatives in the European Parliament between 2017 and 2021. The results shed new light on the complex interactions between MPs representing the same geographic constituents, albeit on different electoral levels.	NA
2023	1085	PC18	Does Listening to Trustworthy News Affect Political Attitudes and Behavior?	Despite the increasing popularity of podcasts as a source of news for many Americans, little is known about their precise role in the information ecosystem. We conduct an online field experiment that exa mines how consumption of trustworthy news via daily podcasts affects attitudes about politics and the media over a two-week period. Our treatment, deployed at the end of the first of two survey waves, asks subjects to subscribe to a specific high-quality daily news podcast, NPR's 'Up First.' In addition, treated subjects are asked to turn on mobile push notifications for the podcast. Randomization ensures that we can observe the causal effects of an exogenous change in respondents' news intake, which we measure by short quizzes sent via text message. We hypothesize that our treatment will increase political knowledge, alter news consumption habits after the intervention period, increase overall media trust, and reduce affective and perceived polarization, relative to the control group. Our results shed light on outcomes linked to the unique possibilities of this medium and, more broadly, on the malleability of mobile-first news consumers' information diets.	NA
2023	1319	PC18	Bad Science: Retractions and Media Coverage.	Flawed research can be harmful both within and outside of academia. Even when published research has been retracted and refuted by the scientific community, it may continue to be a source of misinformation. The media can play an important role in drawing broader attention to research, but may also ensure that research, once retracted, ceases to feature in popular discourse. Yet, there is little evidence on whether media reporting influences the retraction process and authors' careers. Using a conditional difference-in-differences strategy, this paper shows that articles that gained popularity in the media at publication and were later retracted face heavy citation losses, while subsequent citations become more accurate. Further, authors of such papers see a permanent decline in research output. Lastly, the paper provides evidence that media can influence both the likelihood of retraction and its timing, highlighting that the media can play an important role in contributing to the integrity of the research process.

2023	644	PC18	The Role of Violence in Citizens’ Trust in Media for Conflict-Related Information Seeking	Public's dependency on media increases when competing narratives put forward by states versus the non-state armed actors both require an audience to ensure their legitimacy. Media trust becomes highly relevant for citizens’ navigation of political news in contested information environment. We particularly investigate the role of exposure to violence as a key conflict-specific correlate on which media citizens place greater trust for conflict-related information seeking. Using a nationally representative survey conducted in Turkey, we reveal that although exposure to violence does not have a statistically significant direct effect on individuals' trust in mass vs. social media for conflict related information seeking (CRIS), but it exhibits a conditional one: we show that among those who had been exposed to violence, individuals who believe that the state cannot provide an effective security service for its citizens do express higher levels of trust in social media compared to mass media for their CRIS.

2023	805	PC18	How does the Pandemic Shape Political Trust in Authoritarian Regime？ Evidence from Public Opinion on Weibo	Public support is crucial to the maintenance of authority in non-democratic polities. This article analyses public attitudes toward the government’s performance on Sina Weibo during the pandemic alongside an original survey experiment. Building on framing theory, this study analyzes government framing of events or policies related to Covid-19 in the face of public critics. Specifically, this study investigates two questions: does the public stance toward controversial policies or events change in response to government framing?; does the government try to deflect blame to other authorities (local or international) to maintain political trust? To answer these questions, I first use sentiment analysis and content analysis to analyze Weibo posts. Given censorship, grievances against the government will be masked. In a second stage, I therefore conduct a survey experiment to directly expose the respondents to real-world posts on Covid-19 and test their attitude change. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of government framing as well as the limitations of public social media data.	NA
2023	909	BO21	Preaching to the Choir? Evaluating the `Follow the Leader' Heuristic in the Brexit Referendum Context	Are elections beauty contests? Can individual leaders sway voters? The question goes at the heart of fundamental debates in the field of voting behaviour, but it is still unresolved due to the endogeneity and conflation problems that plague existing research on the topic. We leverage the Brexit case, a dictionary analysis of Twitter data, the BES panel survey and difference-in-differences design on YouGov data to investigate the issue under scope conditions that are expected to incentivise leader cue use. We show that individuals’ pre-existing attitudes on the Brexit referendum fundamentally shape attitudes towards leaders but prior leader evaluations have inconsistent or no impact on Brexit referendum decisions. These findings hold for the undecideds as well. The study does not have implications just for voting behaviour research - by showing that leadership cues do not matter even under scope conditions that should encourage their use -, but also for European and British politics research. Our findings reveal that the EU issue dimension is so powerful that it shapes support of domestic leaders, and that opportunism is what lay behind Boris Johnson’s popularity.	NA
2023	1866	1866	My Court, My Emotions: Predicting the Outcomes of Emotional Arousals in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)	It has recently been hypothesized in the political science literature that judges convey their preferences during public hearings (Dietrich et al., 2019). Using the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) as our case study, we show that the leanings of judges can be revealed from oral arguments by extracting visual and audio cues. This paper analyzes 152 webcasts of hearings corresponding to more than 200 hours of video recordings from 2007 to 2022 that show judges in conversation with different plaintiffs, such as government officials and individuals. We then use emotional expressions and the level of emotional arousal to predict judicial decisions. Our video data is further enriched with a unique set of manually collected features used as controls which provide added robustness to the analysis. The research empirically contributes to the field by being the first study to methodologically study emotional arousals of judges from ECHR (i), and by combining image and audio data to predict leanings of judges in high courts (ii). The results show that visual and audio cues carry information that text-based judgments do not possess.	NA
2023	281	PC19	Members of Congress communicate issue expertise and importance by using emotions	Lawmakers want to draw attention to their activities and issue expertise. How do they do this? In this article, we argue that political elites strategically use emotional appeals to draw attention to issues they view as important, where they want to appear as experts, or where they want to credit claim. To test our claim, we use machine learning methods to generate multi-modal measures of emotions contained within more than 475,000 Facebook posts by Members of Congress (MOCs). We extract emotions from the facial expressions contained within images and from the text sentiment of posts by MOCs. We then use a transformer-based topic modelling approach to identify the thematic content of each post. Combining these data together, we show that MOCs strategically attract attention and reactions to their posts on issues where the MOC has policy expertise or a personal interest in the area by amplifying the emotions associated with these posts. Our research demonstrates the value of examining emotions in policy discussions, the importance of images in political communication, and the constraints that political elites face in their activities.

2023	361	M07	Studying morality in non English-speaking contexts: an innovative dictionary translation and validation methodology	The Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD), derived from Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), is a very interesting tool to quantify the use of five moral foundations in texts (Graham et al. 2009). However, the language barrier limits its use in many non-English speaking contexts. In this article, we propose (1) a fully reproducible semi-automatic translation procedure, and (2) an innovative time- and resource efficient dictionary validation methodology based on formally translated documents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of this multilingual tool for the study of morality in a political context. Despite our increasing knowledge about the ideology-driven use of morality in bi-partisan systems, we lack a good understanding, on the one hand, of political actors’ use of moral appeals in multi-party settings and, on the other hand, of what incentives besides ideology lead political actors to strategically use morality. Our findings suggest that the use of morality is ideology-driven for some moral foundations, whereas some other moral domains are being used issue-based, which might suggest a strategic use of certain moral stances by political actors.

2023	486	PC19	Moral Reframing in U.S. Presidential Debates: 2000-2020	Moral reframing is an effective technique at altering the political views of conservatives and liberals (Voelkel & Feinberg, 2017; Wolsko et al., 2016). Moral reframing happens when “a position an individual would not normally support is framed in a way that is consistent with that individual’s moral values” (Feinberg & Willer, 2019, p. 1). But to what degree do politicians morally reframe, and which issues do they reframed the most? The present study, which is based on Moral Foundations Theory, investigates moral reframing efforts during U.S. presidential debates over the last two decades to understand how candidates can expand their appeal by talking about issues in ways that sway those who are not their core supporters. Currently, little is known about how much candidates reframe each issue discussed during debates or what their reframing looks like. To find out, debate transcripts are examined quantitatively with a computational content analysis using the extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (Hopp et al., 2020). Finding show how moral reframing varies by candidate, political party, issue, and incumbent vs. challenger status.	NA
2023	571	PC19	Victimhood Narratives in the United States Congress	Collective victimhood is the perception that a group has been intentionally harmed by the actions of another. Feelings of collective victimhood have been demonstrated to have a strong effect on intergroup bias, outgroup hostility and support for violence. However, little attention has been paid to the use of these narratives by political elites within the context of electoral politics. Along with a descriptive analysis of victimhood narratives in congress, I argue that political elites will utilize these narratives to build support and direct attacks against their political opposition. To test this theory, I will leverage the 7 year time gap between the introduction of C-SPAN to both chambers of Congress for a difference-in-differences design. If these narratives are used instrumentally an increase in the reach of congressional speeches would incentivize more frequent use. To measure the use of victimhood narratives I will build a novel machine-learning classifier to predict the presence of these narratives in speeches parsed from the congressional record. This will provide valuable insight into the use of potentially dangerous or polarizing narratives by political elites.	NA
2023	1636	PC22	The role of message features and heuristic thinking in the evaluation of online political content: a Discrete Choice Experiment	What are the drivers of propaganda circulation on social media? This study aims to disentangle this by identifying message features that may contribute to propaganda dissemination over these online platforms. Drawing from dual-process model scholarship, this research examines how the design of such political content activates heuristic rather than systematic information processing, thus affecting recipients’ evaluations over content validity and shareability. Using data from an online between-subject Discrete Choice Experiment (n = 333), this study assesses the impact of six different informational cues – source, endorsement, popularity, emotional salience, moral valence, and stereotyping – on the likelihood that political messages would be considered valid and shareable on social media. Results demonstrate that all these heuristic-based cues affect the evaluation process, but not always as expected. For instance, stereotypes and endorsements from institutional accounts tend to reduce validity and shareability levels, while endorsements from public figures, such as celebrities or influencers, increase them.

2023	1647	PC22	Economic Spin on Social Media: Biased Information and Strategic Framing	How do candidates for elected office frame solutions to citizens' economic problems? Is there a trade-off between campaigning on identity versus pocket-book issues? This paper assesses the theory that economic issues resonate with the public more when they are tied to cultural and social cleavages and concerns. Using a corpus of approximately 450,000 Congressional Facebook posts, this paper tests whether left-leaning politicians pay greater attention to poverty, labor market issues and fairness, whereas right-leaning politicians stress international competition. Evidence suggests that elites frame various aspects of the economy as valence issues, but sometimes also rhetorically weaponize certain economic topics. Moreover, the observed behavior is consistent with pandering, whereby legislators are rewarded with engagement for their more extreme rhetoric.	NA
2023	1923	PC22	How policymakers and the media set the agenda on digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications	Digitalisation is a megatrend, and how the media and policymakers talk about digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications matters, as it reflects the way the digital transformation is shaped. I relate German parliamentary debates to media coverage on digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications, to analyse to what extent media reporting influences the agenda and framing on digitalisation supported by policymakers, and who dominates the agenda. As for media coverage, I rely on samples of newspaper articles and transcripts of news broadcasting programmes in German public TV. I use hierarchical topic models to compare how similar or different the contexts are, in which digitalisation is talked about in the media and in parliament. I combine this comparative approach with a network analysis, where I model the flow of information between policymakers and the media, by identifying when political parties or individual politicians are mentioned in articles related to digitalisation. This approach helps us understand how close or distant policymakers are to one another in their agenda on digitalisation and its socioeconomic implications, and how certain topics and information spread over time.

2023	1941	PC20	In the Same Place but in the Same Way? - The Effects of the Change in the Editorial Structure of index.hu on COVID-19 News Coverage	In July 2020, in one of Hungary’s most prominent online news sites (index.hu), the entire editorial staff resigned because of political pressure from the autocratic government. While the site has not started to publish hard propaganda with the new editorial team, strong doubts remained as to whether it remained independent. I hypothesize that after the change they are using sophisticated forms of information manipulation. Reporting less bad news (censorship) and framing the government as a competent actor by attributing positive events to them while blaming external actors for the negative event (selective attribution) are two possible ways to implement less visible news manipulation. With a corpus of COVID-19-related news - a salient topic both before and after the editorial change - from index.hu and from four further news sites I aim to document the shift in the news coverage. News fragments with relevant governmental or external actors are selected and rated with human coders and with a supervised learning algorithm. The direction change will be analyzed with the synthetic difference-in-differences method.	NA
2023	2038	PC20	More bang for the buck: Estimating the electoral returns of a co-opted media	Can media outlets help incumbents build support prior to an election? Research on the media’s influence finds that the news can have chilling effects on elections, that its reporting on corruption leads to electoral consequences, and that audiences are sensitive to the media’s tone. In contrast, there is an established literature on the use of public programs to influence voters. I combine both literatures to explore the use of incumbent’s publicity budgets to influence media coverage of elections. First, I identify competitive districts where publicity spending is targeted, second, I use NLP to measure the sentiment of local newspapers’ reporting prior to the election, and third I use a regression discontinuity design to measure the effect of article sentiment on district level results. The case study is Mexico’s 2015 congressional elections, where the incumbent president managed a million-dollar publicity budget and where media often rely on government spending to operate. The findings suggest that incumbents can tip the scale with targeted advertisements that not only promote their agenda, but also alters how newspapers write about them.	NA
2023	1088	BO09	Descriptive representation inequalities and the climate crisis	Is the democratic struggle to find adequate responses to the global climate crisis related to biases in social groups’ descriptive representation? Given that younger and female citizens may place more importance on the climate crisis, their parliamentary underrepresentation could skew the process of political representation against their preferences. However, as climate concerns may be more prevalent among higher social classes, their parliamentary overrepresentation could rectify any age/gender bias. In this paper, we explore this overlooked research puzzle by drawing upon different German data sources whose richness enable us to investigate this from different analytical angles. First, we explore the over-time responsiveness of parliamentary speechmaking vis-à-vis different social groups’ climate attitudes as indicated in survey panel data of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES). Second, to better understand these biases, we combine six waves of public opinion and candidate survey data from the GLES to explore the relevance of sociodemographic characteristics for climate action preferences amongst - and a potential attitudinal rift between - publics and elites. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of political representation and climate action.	NA
2023	1483	BO09	Worried About Climate Change and Unsatisfied With Democracy?	Climate change is widely perceived as the most significant challenge of this century. We argue the more citizens are concerned about the effects of climate change and unsatisfied with their government's climate politics, the greater their dissatisfaction with democracy and propensity to hold anti-elitist views. We draw on two German panel data sets to address these understudied relationships. First, we examine the main relationship between being worried about climate change and satisfaction with democracy as it exists in Germany using data from three waves (2010, 2016, 2020) of the Socio-Economic Panel. We reproduce this analysis with data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) Panel, ranging from 2017 to 2022. Further, using three GLES waves, we study how satisfaction with the government's climate action affects general satisfaction with democracy. Finally, we investigate the association between prioritizing climate action and multiple dimensions of populism, focusing on anti-elitism. Against the backdrop of exacerbating climate change, our research contributes to understanding how worries about climate change and dissatisfaction with political action might translate into disenchantment with the democratic system itself.

2023	1528	BO09	Distributive implications of individual carbon emission reductions: Insights from a novel Priority Evaluator experiment	Urgent action is needed to limit negative future impacts of climate change. Recent focus has increasingly shifted towards national-level domestic politics, where the issue of climate change is fundamentally shaped by distributive conflicts. Here, citizens are faced with divergent opportunity costs in the push towards reducing individual emissions, largely dependent upon income levels and behavioral patterns. Yet surprisingly, little is currently known about individual prioritization of different behavioral adaptations and associated costs when faced with decisions about how to reduce individual carbon emissions. Notably, it is crucial to explore how behavioral adaptations are shaped by financial possibilities. Priority evaluation, a form of choice experimental designs, have been used in transport and planning studies to explore behavioral cost-benefit trade-offs. We introduce the priority evaluation approach to environmental politics leveraging original experimental survey data from a representative sample of Swiss residents. In particular, we identify how citizens’ tradeoffs across a diverse range of emission reduction behavioral adaptations are conditioned by income. Furthermore, we explore whether individual behavioral priorities are associated with climate policy preferences.	NA
2023	1830	PL12	Global vs. Local - Framing Environmental Issues in Parliamentary Debates	The relocation of environmental impacts through international trade from high- to lower-income countries poses an increasing problem for global and local environmental quality. One reason high-income countries outsource environmental degradation might be that environmental issues abroad are less salient in the political process than environmental quality at home. To assess this salience gap, I examine differences between parties and members of parliament in portraying global compared to local environmental issues in parliamentary speeches. To this end, I analyze parliamentary speeches between 1990 and 2018 from the British House of Commons and the German Bundestag. The results indicate that environmental issues in foreign countries are addressed more frequently by left-wing parties and by less experienced members of parliament. Additionally, the results suggest that in two-party and multi-party systems, primarily small parties play a leading role in setting the agenda for environmental issues abroad.	NA
2023	369	PL12	Policymakers’ Awareness of Scientific Solutions Towards Carbon Neutrality	Reducing carbon emissions is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity. Scientists and most politicians agree that a “net zero future” is required to limit the impact of climate change. Yet, we know little about policymakers’ awareness of and focus on specific climate-friendly innovations. We study this question by focusing on Ireland, a country that announced goals to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. We first retrieve all academic publications on the energy transition involving researchers working at Irish universities. Afterwards, we train and validate transformer-based machine learning classifiers to identify these innovations in legislative speeches delivered between 2009 and 2022. After mapping the prevalence of scientific solutions in the political discourse, we investigate whether the Paris Agreement in 2016 changed the salience of scientific solutions for tackling climate change. Finally, we assess whether legislators’ backgrounds and constituency characteristics predict the focus on specific solutions. These findings contribute to our understanding of politicians’ awareness and support of recent innovations required to achieve carbon neutrality.	NA
2023	489	PL12	Is it all Cheap Talk?: The effects of international climate agreements on domestic political debates	Critics often decry the absence of decisive political action following international climate talks. They contend that politicians’ international pledges are cheap talk with little bearing on domestic action. Building on an original conceptual and empirical framework we hypothesize that countries more reliant on carbon intensive industries see these issues related to their pledges become more salient in elite debates, and their positions on these issues more polarized; in contrast, in countries with greater use of renewables expect to see increased salience in elite debates without increased disagreement. We test these expectations in 16 European-countries, 2009-2019, with the ParlEE dataset, which is based on a supervised machine learning classification of issues and positions over time. Consistent with a more optimistic perspective that international pledges are not cheap talk, our analysis indicates a clear shift in the salience and position of national parties following the announcement of the 2015 Paris Agreement. These results hold implications for studies linking international agreements to domestic politics and the consequences thereof for national decision-making as well as for domestic political studies of party and governmental position-taking.

In March 2022, the European Commission adopted the Taxonomy Delegated Act, committing to a policy classifying this type of energy production as sustainable. With support for nuclear energy on the rise and ongoing challenges to energy security in Europe, how can the timing of this substantive policy change be explained? Our new survey data uncover increased public scepticisim in Germany around nuclear energy phase-out and disposal leading up to the EC decision. Policy change might therefore be conceived as a response to variation in public opinion. However, by relying on insights from the field of energy policy and others, I show that nuclear energy is by no means a sustainable energy source. Rather, this is an instance of misplaced procedural responsiveness, where the EC uses the window of public opinion change to cater to particularistic national interests. This paper helps to understand the causal mechanisms driving policy development by linking responsiveness to public opinion with a substantive discussion of the policy issue. It underscores how misplaced institutional responsiveness can legitimize environmentally dangerous policies under the cloak of climate change.	NA
2023	1022	PL19	The Politicization of International Organizations in Parliamentary Debates	Which international organizations (IOs) are most likely to be politicized in domestic politics and why? Existing scholarship posits a causal link between IO authority and politicization, yet empirical tests of this proposition are limited to single country or single IO case studies. This article presents the first comparative study of IO politicization spanning considerable temporal, geographic, and IO variation. We track the salience of 75 IOs in six legislatures between 1991 and 2018 and provide the most complete evidence to date for the existence of an authority-politicization nexus in international politics. Crucially, we also show which type of authority matters most for the politicization of IOs. We find that find that increases in delegated authority have a larger effect on IO politicization than increases in pooled authority (delegated authority hypothesis) and that general purpose IOs are more likely to be politicized than task specific IOs (contract hypothesis). The article also contributes a new dataset of over 600,000 statements on IOs in parliamentary debates.	NA
2023	730	PL19	Mind the Context! The Importance of the Data-Generating Process for Analyzing Legislative Text Data	With the progressing advances in text analysis methods and the increasing accessibility of parliamentary documents, the range of available tools for legislative scholars has increased massively over the past years. While the potential for comparative studies is huge, researchers can easily overlook the pitfalls associated with analyzing these documents. Against this background, the aim of this project is twofold. First, I asses on a theoretical level how seemingly identical legislative instruments may vary in different countries. I show that a clear definition of concepts such as speech or bill and the attention to and description of the data-generating process are key to avoid comparing apples with oranges. In the second part, I show what implications these distinctions can have for comparative analyses. Applying common text-as-data methods to a new corpus combining legislative speech data with bill and law documents, I show in three examples how these analyses come to different results depending on the underlying conceptualization of the object of study.

2023	739	PL19	Speaking Styles, Specialization and Seniority: An Analysis of Parliamentary Speeches in the Austrian Nationalrat	Parliamentary speech-making aims at effective communication. Speaking ahead of final voting in plenary sessions, MPs in parliamentary systems craft speeches primarily to defend their party’s decision to vote in favour or against an issue to the public and other parties. Occasionally, the goal of a speech will be a defense of a personal vote and, in rare instances, to persuade wavering colleagues from their own or other parties. To achieve effective communication, a speech should be clear and comprehensible. However, MPs have different styles of speaking due to rhetorical talent, education, habits, training and actual practice. Recent studies have focused on aspects of parliamentary speech-making such as issue choice or sentiment. We do not know much yet about speaking styles. This paper studies parliamentary speeches in the Austrian Nationalrat (1996-2021). We apply a text-as-data approach to detect speaking styles in parliament and use the type of debate and MPs characteristics (education, seniority, specialization, frequency of speaking) to identify factors that influence the way MPs speak, thereby increasing our understanding of legislative debates.

2023	781	PL19	The Unforced Force of the Better Argument? Computationally Assessing Argument Quality in Parliamentary Debates	At the core of deliberative democracy is the idea that political decisions shall be based on mutual discussion and ultimately, good arguments. While recent research looked at how the nature of political communication has changed, e.g. in terms of political sophistication, we add to this another layer and analyze how the quality of natural language arguments in parliamentary debates has evolved. For this, we apply a machine learning model for computationally assessing the logical strength in parliamentary debates in the UK and Germany from the 1990s to 2018 based on the ParlSpeech v2 Corpus. We hypothesize that government and opposition parties differ in their argumentation quality due to differing “necessities” because government parties are both responsible and accountable, and thus are forced to stick to more factual and cogent expressions. Similarly, we hypothesize that mainstream parties differ from more extreme parties at both ends of the left-right spectrum as they need to appear more “rational” in order to appeal to a larger electorate.

2023	794	PL19	The Essential Role of Procedural Rules for the Statistical Analysis of Legislative Speech Counts	Many studies in the field of legislative politics examine legislators’ participation in plenary debates to inform a diverse set of research questions. These studies aim to understand how political or demographic factors such as mandate type or gender are related to the frequency with which legislators participate on the parliamentary floor. The dominant methodological approach to analyzing debate participation is centered around regression models where the number of speeches per legislator during one legislative term gets regressed on key variables of interest and a set of control variables. I argue that such models produce biased results because they fail to take procedural rules into account. I formalize the argument and derive the exact analytical form of the bias. Next, I develop clear model-building guidelines for researchers interested in comparing speech counts by legislators of different groups and demonstrate the relevance of my approach with empirical data. I conclude by discussing broader implications. The identified issue is not limited to the analysis of parliamentary speech counts alone but complicates the analysis of portfolio allocations or committee assignments in a similar way.	NA
2023	1086	PL21	Globalisation as a Cleavage or Cause? Examining the Existence of a Transnational Cleavage in Europe.	Transnational, integration-demarcation, EU integration, or globalisation-nationalism. This proposed new cleavage has many names, but both its content and existence are contested. For some, EU integration is a cleavage dividing society into two groups: those who benefit and those who lose out from the economic integration and freedom of movement entailed by integration. However, others conceptualise EU integration and globalisation as critical junctures that alter the class cleavage and heighten competitions over immigration. In this paper, we examine whether there is a transnational cleavage. An observable implication of the existence of an EU-related cleavage is that parties will attempt to appeal to either the the winners or losers of EU integration by combining both dimensions. In contrast, if European integration alters existing cleavages, then parties' positions on EU integration will be structured by either the class cleavage or the immigration divide, depending on the context. Analysing party competition across EU Member States using CHES data, we find no transnational cleavage, even though demands on parties to be ideological coherent should enhance such a cleavage’s visibility, compared to examining voters.

2023	1169	PL21	Do Citizens’ Perceptions of Parties’ Positions in a Multidimensional Space Shape Partisanship?	Scholars increasingly characterize party competition as multidimensional. However, there are important differences between countries in the extent to which new fault lines cross-cut existing ideological oppositions. It has been argued that such differences are important, because the cross-cuttingness of parties’ positions on different ideological dimensions determines the clarity of parties’ brands and in this way shapes party attachments. Most of what we know about the connection between parties’ position, brand clarity and partisanship relies on expert- or manifesto-based estimates of party positions, forcing scholars to assume that voters are perfectly informed about parties’ positions on multiple dimensions. To address this limitation, we rely on an original data collection of surveys in 11 countries in which we asked respondents to position parties on six different issues, capturing economic, social, and cultural divisions. Our design allows connecting citizens’ perceptions of the space of party competition in their country to views about the clarity of parties’ ideological brands and measures of partisanship. We provide unique individual-level insights into the ways in which party positions and the restructuring of party competition shape party attachments.	NA
2023	1575	PL14	Executive Appointments under Legislative Oversight	A large literature argues that the executive’s appointment powers may bestow them with a significant policy advantage against the legislature. In practice, however, the legislature may also deploy a variety of instruments to strike back at opportunistic executives. In this paper, we use novel data from the Swedish government to investigate whether the executive might adapt their appointment strategies to legislative pressures. We take advantage of a vast system of ad-hoc commissions that the Swedish ministers have developed over time as part of the more general public bureaucracy, covering more than 70,000 unique appointments between 1971 and 2021. We find that, while the ministers generally oversample appointees from their own partisan ranks, the overall distribution of political appointees also tends to reflect the prevailing balance of power in the parliament. In line with recent theories of interbranch relations, our results highlight both the executive’s penchant for bureaucratic opportunism and the legislature’s constraining reach.	NA
2023	1959	PE19	Interest Group Entry into a New Political Domain: Interest Group Mobilization During Supreme Court Confirmations, 1930-2020	We study interest group entry into new political domains. Focusing on Supreme Court nominations, we present data on all recurrent activist groups between 1930-2020, examining the changing organizational ecology of appointment politics. We then formulate a game-theoretic model of group leaders’ decisions to enter a political domain, and citizens’ decisions to join entering groups. The theory identifies demand side factors, supply side factors, and strategic factors in entry. To empirically study group decisions to enter or not enter, we examine the universe of frequent Supreme Court amici from 1953-2013. We measure relevant demand, supply, and strategic variables, including new data on amici and social movements, interest in court policy by amici, and crowding in ideological niches. Then, we statistically model individual-level decisions by the groups to durably enter appointments activism. The statistical models uncover robust empirical patterns suggested by the theory. Substantively, interest in court policy increased the probability of entry while crowding in ideological niches decreased it.	NA
2023	2040	PL21	Globalization and Parties’ Use of Strategic Ambiguity in Election Campaigns	We argue and demonstrate that parties make more ambiguous statements during election campaigns when they are exposed to economic globalization. In doing so, we make theoretical and empirical contributions to understanding how states’ exposure to globalization affects the quality of representation at the national level. Parties aim to avoid the negative electoral consequences of promise breaking by making more ambiguous statements when they are more exposed to globalization and are therefore less able to keep their campaign promises. Ambiguous campaign statements are reconcilable with a broad range of subsequent government policies and are thus unlikely to be perceived by voters as broken promises. The empirical analysis demonstrates the robust positive effect of globalization on the ambiguity of parties’ electoral appeals. Using an established dictionary-based method, we measure the level of ambiguity in 293 English-language party platforms across six countries from 1970 to 2019 (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States). These findings have significant implications for the form of democratic representation in countries that are deeply integrated into the international economic system.	NA
2023	1773	PL20	Substantial constituency representation by elected representatives on social media in a mixed-member electoral system	Western democracies are confronted with how the interests of citizens can be optimally represented. In mixed-member electoral systems (MMES), a system of representation has developed which gives expression to the proportional representation of election results. Moreover, direct election of MPs ensures constituency representation in parliament. With regard to directly elected MPs, various studies show that parliamentary voting behaviour differs from that of MPs elected via party lists. However, it is not yet known whether directly elected MPs are more responsive to policy-specific political desires of their constituencies. We test this in the German MMES before the 2017 federal election by comparing the issue priorities of voters using GLES data with the issues that their elected representatives highlight and emphasise on social media. We use a biterm topic model to identify 5 central issues mentioned by voters in >1,000,000 posts written by MP's. Our results show that directly elected representatives are more responsive to their constituencies than party-list elected representatives. The direct accountability of directly elected MPs to the electorate thus has a clear impact on the substantive representation of citizens.	NA
2023	1901	PL20	Party Competition between Mainstream Parties and the Radical Right on Immigration	Party competition on immigration has recently come into focus of research on the radical right’s electoral performance. Scholarship illustrates that the strategic behaviour of mainstream parties (MP) influences the election results of the radical right (RR). This paper complements respective studies by analysing the strategy that MP adopt. The choice of MP is considered in the context of the RR’s policy stance. Examining the positional distance vis-à-vis the RR, this paper addresses factors that influence the strategic positioning of MP on immigration. An investigation of the competing policy proposals is worthwhile, as the extent of topical convergence is linked to electoral performance and changes of immigration laws. Relying on the Immigration in Party Manifestos (IPM) dataset, the analyses cover 11 West European countries from 1985 to 2015. Due to IPM’s profound coverage of the immigration stance, the dataset allows to examine party competition on prominent sub-areas like immigration control. Preliminary results indicate that MP are not oriented towards the RR alone. Instead, MP also consider the positioning vis-à-vis their main competitor.	NA
2023	213	PL20	Do Parties Facilitate the Political Representation of Citizens’ Issue Priorities? Evidence from the German Case	The question of which issues do (or do not) become the subject of collectively binding decision-making concerns one of the most important problems in a democracy. A growing number of empirical studies have begun to investigate which policy issues make it onto the political agenda. In representative democracy, substantive representation is supposed to be achieved by the party system. Like conveyer belts, parties are expected to transmit policy preferences from citizens to government. In this paper, we assess to what extent parties pick up citizens’ issues and place them on the government agenda. Controlling for agenda setting by the news media, we find that the issue agenda of citizens is transmitted to the government agenda via the party system. Beyond this, government does not directly pick up citizens’ issue priorities. This supports the transmission belt perspective of the party system. Combining a focus on policy agendas with party politics, our analysis has important implications for the understanding of citizens’ agenda representation by the party system and the mechanisms of democratic representation more broadly.

2023	246	PL20	Parties’ Group Appeals as Representative Claims: A New Perspective on Parties’ Efforts to Connect with Voters	Social groups and group identity exert significant influence on the political system, affecting voters’ understanding of politics and parties’ efforts to connect with voters. While scholars mainly focus on policy as the connecting thread between parties and voters, recent studies highlight the importance of group appeals as well. These studies, however, predominantly treat group appeals as a strategic tool to maximize votes, resulting in a narrow understanding of this phenomenon. In this paper we propose to address this drawback by approaching group appeals from the perspective of the representative claim theory, wherein group appeals are viewed as the first step in the process of political representation—the claim-making—and election campaigns are the venue where the claim-making takes place. This approach allows us to better evaluate how parties go about forging connections with voters based on social group identity detached from policy, revealing the significance of intangible aspects of belonging, recognition, and the expression of shared identity to the way political parties connect with voters.

2023	466	PL20	Who represents the working-class? Introducing and implementing a life-course approach to the study of class representation	Social scientists and the public agree that it matters who political decision-makers are. Yet, while the representation of some groups (e.g., women and ethnic minorities) has attracted a lot of scholarly attention, the representation of social classes has been studied much less. The scant evidence that exists points to a severe underrepresentation of working-class voters, yet this research is beset by a key conceptual problem: People move between classes during their life course (much more so than between genders and ethnic groups). Therefore, conceptualizing the representation of different social classes becomes theoretically and empirically highly demanding. We address this challenge first, by theorizing the implications of a dynamic understanding of class over the life-course, and second, by collecting highly granular data on the class origins and occupational trajectories of several thousand ministers in post-war European democracies. We are therefore able to present the most conceptually advanced and empirically comprehensive account to date of the representation of social classes in European governments since 1945.	NA

How does the caretaker status of a government affect party political dynamics in parliament during a large crisis? Generally, caretaker governments are not mandated to introduce important policy changes until a new and fully-mandated government is installed. Yet major crises can demand decisive political action. This paper aims to understand the consequences of the caretaker status of the Rutte III government in the Netherlands (after its resignation in January 2021) for government-opposition dynamics during the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. We therefore draw on a qualitative text analysis of a dozen parliamentary debates. Surprisingly, we find that differences between mandated and caretaker status (before and after elections) have little effect on parliamentary dynamics. The caretaker status has only been a political issue for a minor part of the opposition parties. There is some evidence for a divergence between (former) coalition partners, but only after the elections. As such, this case provides unique insights about the functioning of caretaker conventions during crises which offers opportunities for new theorizing in the under-theorized field on caretaker cabinets.

2023	1515	PL22	Can you hear me? An analysis on how virtual proceeding affected the content and influence of legislative speeches	During the COVID pandemic, virtual proceedings have been adopted by parliaments across the world as a temporary measure to meet the challenges that comes with lockdown and social distancing. However, virtual proceeding in parliaments could be beneficial beyond mere mitigation during the pandemic and it has been suggested by both scholars and practitioners that they could play a role in parliamentary procedure in the long run. This paper seeks to better understand how virtual proceedings affect the deliberative process in legislative debates. By analysing the content of contribution made by British MPs via teleconferencing software during the pandemic and contrasting them with contributions made by their colleagues in the House of Commons chamber during hybrid sessions, this paper seeks to understand whether virtual proceedings affect the emotion expressed as well as whether participating virtually adversely affect the influence of individual legislators during parliamentary debates.

2023	1873	PL22	The Efficiency of Parliaments: Law-Making During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Four Western Democracies	The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented a particular challenge to parliaments as law-making bodies. Governments demanded far-reaching powers to respond swiftly and efficiently under conditions of extreme uncertainty. We compare the speed of Covid-related law-making in the French Assemblée nationale, the German Bundestag, the Irish Dáil, and the Israeli Knesset between 2020 and 2021. These legislatures were chosen for the variations in government agenda-setting powers and cabinet stability. Based on a delegation framework we formulate a number of hypotheses. The Bundestag and the Knesset, two relatively strong parliaments, legislated more frequently in relation to Covid-19 than the Assemblée nationale and the Irish Dáil, where relatively strong governments relied more heavily on executive decree powers and delegated legislation. Comparing Covid-related bills to legislation in other policy areas, we find that all four legislatures were capable of accelerating the speed of legislative decision-making in the face of the crisis and demonstrated a high level of efficiency. An increasing number of cabinet parties and an increasing level of preference heterogeneity within the cabinet, however, slowed down Covid-related legislation.	NA
2023	691	PL22	Framing the Covid-19 Pandemic: How Political Parties Engage in Party Competition in Times of Crisis	The Covid-19 pandemic represented a severe shock that affected almost all areas of life and confronted political parties with a novel situation. The containment of the pandemic required full attention and severely influenced policy-making and party competition. However, the longer the crisis lasted, the more negative public opinion towards government measures turned. In such circumstances, it can be beneficial for political parties to send policy-signals and present themselves as credible alternatives in party competition. One possible avenue to achieve this is framing. Framing allows political actors to address different facets of a crisis, such as the protection of the health care system or particular aspects of social and economic life (e.g. labor-market policies, education). Simultaneously, the evolution of the crisis, changes in public opinion and party-level factors potentially influence framing. To analyse how parties framed the Covid-19 pandemic, I apply a text-as-data approach to press releases from Austrian parties. In conjunction with data on the number of Covid-19 infections and public opinion, I study how parties use framing to send policy-signals and engage in party competition in times of crisis.	NA
2023	1440	PL23	Tweeting vs Retweeting: How Centralized is Political Communication on Social Media?	In recent years, social media have become an essential tool for political communication. Not only does it allow politicians to address the public without the filter of traditional media, but it also allows politicians to voice opinions directly on any topic. For political parties, this presents both an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, politicians can tailor messages to their local constituents. On the other hand, parties appear disjointed and risk an electoral backlash if they do not enforce clear party stances. To understand how parties perform this balancing act, we study the communication of parties and politicians on social media in four European countries. We argue that electoral systems shape the incentives to centralize social media communication by political parties, especially during electoral campaigns. To test our hypotheses, we collected a data set of all tweets by members of parliament in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Poland between 2015 and 2022. We analyze our data using dynamic network analysis. Our results have implications for the study of intra-party politics and electoral systems.	NA
2023	1485	PL23	Smiling Women - How Female Politicians Present Themselves on Social Media	Social media present an alternative way for female politicians to present themselves. So far we have only limited knowledge about the way female politicians use this communication. On the one hand, women politicians may simply use social media to present themselves in a likable, pleasing way e.g. by smiling a lot. In contrast, they may use the chance to present a more serious, even aggressive style as shown by a more aggressive tweeting style used by some female politicians in the US (Evans et al., 2014). This paper investigates how female politicians present themselves in social media and what influences the presentation of their emotions in pictures. We collected and analyzed more than 150'000 posts of politicians on Facebook and Instagram in Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Netherlands. We use deep learning models to detect emotion and recognize politicians' faces in images. Findings show that female politicians present themselves with more positive emotions than their male counterparts but that this is also moderated by the age and the ideology of politicians.	NA

In recent decades, Europe's mainstream parties have struggled with declining enthusiasm and willingness to participate among their members. Whilst there are many theories on what could be done to mobilize party members, these theories have rarely been tested. We partnered with a Dutch party and ran a field experiment with over 38000 of their members---the full population---to test what motivates a party member to become active in a national campaign. We also focused on what motivates female and young party members, as the most under-represented groups in the party's membership. We test the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies---a call, an email, or an email and a call. In two studies, we randomized which party members are approached using which recruitment strategy. We measure party members' participation using a variety of outcomes such as signing up for campaign events, doing relational organizing training sessions, showing up for campaign activities, and engaging with the party on social media.

2023	831	PL23	Personalized media attention in constituency campaigns – A candidate perspective	To what extent and under what conditions do local media pay attention to constituency candidates in election campaigns? This paper explores this question from a candidate perspective. In this vein, it advances from candidate survey data to assess the perceived level of access to local media and main predictors in this regard. Specifically, we ask about the role of electoral factors such as marginality and the effective number of local parties as opposed to candidate level factors such as incumbency and candidates’ campaign strategies, i.e. whether candidates aimed to run personalized campaigns or rather not. This analysis contributes to broader debates about decentralized forms of personalized politics, where MPs and constituency candidates are assumed to take center stage vis-à-vis their parties. The paper stresses the need to better understand the role of the media in this regard and why – from the candidates’ perspective – they augment or downplay candidate saliency in campaign contexts. We draw from the German case, and the German Longitudinal Election Study in particular, as an unlikely case since it pitches personalized electoral rules against strong party organizations.	NA
2023	517	PL24	Anything to lose, Anything to gain? Experimental evidence on the electoral consequences of parties' reaction to protests.	Can protests affect electoral behaviour? With growing literature exploring the political consequences of protests, one key assumption is that political parties and decision-makers respond to protests out of fear of electoral repercussions. However, what voters expect of their representatives when it comes to political protests has not received much empirical scrutiny. This paper addresses this missing link between protest mobilisation, responsiveness, and voting behaviour using a survey experiment in Germany. The study explores if the occurrence of a protest can affect the electoral calculations of voters and if political behaviour is influenced by three different party strategies towards protests - accommodative, dismissive, and adversarial strategies.

2023	549	PL24	Does opposition parties' legislative behavior increase voter turnout?	Recent research has shown that opposition parties’ legislative behavior is related to their electoral outcomes. That is, opposition parties that consistently vote against government bills in parliament tend to be more electorally successful. We contribute to this literature by arguing theoretically and demonstrating empirically that parliamentary conflict between the opposition and the government increases voter turnout, in addition to the opposition parties vote shares. Specifically, we argue that when there is a clear distinction between the two sides of the aisle, voters perceive the election as more consequential and salient, and therefore are motivated to turn out to vote. We test our theory using both aggregate and individual-level analyses for 11 advanced-industrial democracies and show that turnout is higher when government-opposition relations are characterized by more conflict. Our results have important implications for parties’ and legislators’ voting behavior in parliament, party unity, and democratic accountability.	NA

A growing body of literature has looked at the stability and performance of minority governments. Meanwhile, we know very little about how voters perceive this government configuration and whether they understand its political implications. We ask respondents in Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, three European countries with varying degrees of exposure to minority governments, about their knowledge and evaluation of minority governments. Using a survey experiment, we study whether negative perceptions of minority governments are due to ignorance, misunderstandings or actual beliefs. The findings contribute to our understanding of voters’ political sophistication and have implications for research on government formation, voting theory, and public opinion.	NA
2023	693	PL24	Campaigning from Parliament: the impact of institutional roles and opinion dynamics on politician campaigning strategies	Assuming politicians are office-seekers (Rabushka and Shepsle, 1971) motivated to gain re-election and/or support the party, we might expect MPs to focus on those issues that their party has a reputation for competence on (Budge and Farlie, 1983, and Petrocik, 1996), as well as upon those issues that are most prescient in the minds of the electorate (Bélanger and Meguid, 2008). However, this literature focuses on assessments made during election campaigns per se rather than campaigning that occurs during highly visible and publicised legislative procedures such as Prime Minister’s Questions. This matters because the dynamics are very different (e.g. Government backbenchers might eschew these strategies and opt instead for congratulatory ‘questioning’ to counter PM unpopularity). Controlling for seniority, marginality, MP issue interests, this paper uses PMQs data from 1997 to 2019 to examine the political campaign strategies of MPs outside of the traditional campaigning arenas studied to date to see the extent being an MP from the government side effects behaviour, and what this means for the applicability and validity of issue ownership and wave riding theory.

2023	823	PL24	Rationalizing Others:When do Partisans Accept or DiminishIdeological Dissonance?	In this paper, I argue that loyal partisans accept the changes in ideological dissonance provoked by the movement of their preferred party and diminish the dissonance caused by the movement or emergence of non-supported parties. To show this, I use two panel studies in Spain and the United Kingdom covering different scenarios in which changes in ideological dis- sonance can be quasi-exogenously manipulated: voters who remain loyal to a party that moves farther away from them, and voters who remain loyal to their party despite the emergence of a party occupying their ide- ological position. My results suggest that loyal partisans are more willing to accept high levels of ideological dissonance caused by the movement of their party than by the emergence or the movement of a non-supported party. This nuances previous studies on projection and persuasion effects: voters are not blind to ideological changes in their elected parties, nor do they uncritically follow them.	NA
2023	1814	PL25	The Effects of Malapportionment on the Representation of District Interests. Evidence from Italy.	A normatively appealing characteristic of most representative democracies is that their electoral rules are designed to assure that each group of voters receives representation roughly proportionate to their number. Scholars have devoted a great deal of attention to malapportionment precisely because it is a violation of this principle. However, discerning the effects of malapportionment can be challenging because the intentional overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of some districts is almost always associated with characteristics of the districts that can confound the effects of the number of MPs they select. I take advantage of the design of elections to the Italian Senate between 1994 and 2001 and a comprehensive database of actions by individual MPs to disentangle the real benefits of being relatively overrepresented. I first show that due to the two-tier system one-fourth of the single-member districts end up electing two representatives instead of one. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin, I then find that districts that barely elect two representatives are more frequently the target of a wide range of legislative and non-legislative activities than districts electing one representative.

2023	407	PL25	Carpetbag Campaigning: How campaign donations and labor are reallocated from across U.S. states and districts	Representation by single-member districts means that citizens in one constituency care about the outcomes of elections in other constituencies. political parties and individual candidate in the United States mobilize this interest for fund raising and campaign labor. Such out-of-district support is often viewed with suspicion in a geographically centered system of representation, but it may also be a response to malapportionment and gerrymandering by allowing citizens in constituencies where their votes are not pivotal to nevertheless participate. This avenue may be particularly important for groups that are systematically underrepresented by the way districts are drawn (including urban voters and underrepresented minorities). This paper explores the implications of this explanation for out-of-state donors and campaign volunteers. Preliminary evidence suggests that out-of-state help often flows to dist ricts where the aided candidate is not particularly likely to win, but it generally flows from districts where similar efforts would be even less pivotal. Where political parties (rather than candidates) are instrumental in directing resources, they tend to be somewhat more efficiently directed.	NA
2023	768	PL25	A second chance elsewhere. Estimating the effect of winning (vs. being the runner-up) on future electoral prospects.	The effect of being the winner (vs. being the runner-up) on winning subsequent elections has been estimated across a series of countries using regression discontinuity design. We contribute to this literature by incorporating politicians who move across constituencies. The US and the UK are our case studies. UK-US differences are not apparent when comparing estimates of the individual incumbency advantage, i.e., winning the same office in the same constituency. UK-US differences in the career advantage of winning office are almost entirely driven by the ability of the UK's close-race runners-up to win elsewhere subsequently. Runners-up are more likely to move to safer seats. Marginal winners become locked-in to their seat. In the US, we observe negligible movement across constituencies.	NA
2023	84	CP04	Second Class Citizens: Class Bias and The Effects of Electoral Formulas in Proportional Representation	Proportional electoral systems are often seen as the best means to produce statistically representative government. In this paper, I find that majority bonuses—whereby the party that obtains a plurality of votes automatically secures an absolute majority in the legislature—can actually bolster the number of statistically atypical working-class candidates that manage to obtain office. I argue that this difference is mechanically driven, as workers are systematically granted lower placements on party lists under PR. Majority bonuses increase the number of seats allocated to winning parties, thereby reducing the number of parties in a given legislature. These dynamics allow a larger number of workers with low list placements to obtain a seat in legislatures. As a test of theory, I present evidence from a natural experiment on a municipality-level change in electoral law, which took place in Italy in 1993.	NA
2023	1180	PL26	A complete history of parliamentary debates in Zambia	We present a unique dataset on parliamentary debates in Zambia from 1924 to 2022. This corpus spans the complete history of Zambia’s current National Assembly, back to the creation of the Legislative Council of Northern Rhodesia. Over the course of the century, Zambia changed from an authoritarian colony under British rule, via an independent one-party dictatorship, to a multiparty presidential system. We outline how these regimes implied vastly different accountability structures and identify whether and how this affected both the agenda setting and the level of visible conflict within the institution. We investigate whether these changes can be attributed to changed behavior by individual MPs, or to the changed composition of the parliament. In sum, our corpus provides new leverage on questions related to legislative politics under autocratic and democratic rule.	NA
2023	633	PL26	How elite defections can weaken authoritarian regimes	While elite unity is the central pillar of authoritarian regime stability, the defection of ruling elites often threatens authoritarian rule. Yet, there has been a shortfall of empirical work on when and how defections can weaken autocracies due to the lack of comparable cross-country data on elite dissent strategies. To remedy this gap, this chapter of my ongoing book manuscript examines what type of elite defections can weaken rulers' ability to stay in power. By employing the book’s dataset and panel-matching regressions, the findings suggest that defectors' success in establishing alliances with existing opposition groups will affect their capacity to become credible threats that authoritarian leaders cannot defeat through policy promises, repression, or co-optation. This association holds when elites do not coordinate their departure and even becomes stronger when defections occur closer to a national election. However, defections that result from demotions, purges, or controversial resignations tend to fall into political irrelevance. Taken together, the findings contribute to the literature on democratization, authoritarianism, and anti-regime alliances by focusing on the strains and disruptions within authoritarian governments.

2023	1812	CP25	Plants of Indoctrination: Political Exiles and the long-term Persistence of Repression	Political exile, as a form of targeted political repression, is a frequent tool dictators use to protect their regime. Despite its omnipresence as a tool of muting opposition, we know surprisingly little about its long-term implications for new democracies. We try to fill this gap by focusing on the case of Greece and the exiles instituted to remote islands by two authoritarian regimes and the democratic governments that intervened in between. Using rich archival data, we find an enduring imprint of political exiles on the ideological profile of the areas that hosted them. Delving into the mechanism driving this effect, we show that the effect is not simply due to the change in the composition of the local population or the selective migration of the local population. Instead, the evidence points to a direct pattern of cultural transmission, built around the formation of a new identity around the experience of political exile. Further analyses confirm that this identity remains vivid through both formal and informal mechanisms of collective memory.	NA
2023	1893	CP01	Charismatic Leaders and Democratic Backsliding	In recent years, democratic nations have frequently elected charismatic leaders. Political parties tend to benefit electorally from charismatic politicians' popularity. However, we demonstrate theoretically that parties may also pay a cost. When they become reliant on a leader's charisma, parties grow less able to sanction their behavior in office and more prone to catering to their will---they become personalized. We show that this is particularly true in contexts of high ideological polarization and strong institutional foundations of democracy. This inversion of the power dynamic between parties and politicians provides greater room to charismatic leaders than less charismatic ones to enact anti-democratic policies. The likelihood of party illiberalization, democratic backsliding, and autocratic reversion are thus higher under charismatic leaders. We find that the associations between leaders' charisma and patterns of democratic breakdown, democratic quality, party illiberalism, and party personalization over the past several decades are consistent with our theoretical expectations.

2023	193	CP25	Repression after Coups: The Role of Deposed Leader Partisanship	Repression frequently occurs in the aftermath of coup-d’états. However, the scale and intensity of society-wide repression after these events vary substantially. In this article, we argue that the partisanship of the deposed chief executive influences the level of post-coup repression. Since left-wing incumbents rely on a rely on a network of various formal organizations with potential for (mass) mobilization such as formal party organizations, trade unions and other civil society organizations to gain and stay in power, agents overthrowing left-wing incumbents carry out greater levels of repression during and in the immediately aftermath of a coup to repress these organizations and solidify their new rule. This argument is tested on a panel of Latin-American and Caribbean countries from 1920 to 2021. The results show robust evidence in favor of the argument.	NA
2023	424	CP01	Stretching Democratic Boundaries: Elections, Authoritarian Polarization, and Autocratization Onsets	There is a long-standing debate about elections and whether they lead to democratization episodes. We contend, however, that elections can also be a hotspot for autocratization onsets. We theorize how every election is potentially contested between democratic and autocratic forces and how party systems’ polarization around this cleavage predicts autocratization onset as a result of elections. Drawing on three different datasets on democracy levels and political parties' ideologies, we introduce a novel authoritarian polarization index and test its relationship with the onset of autocratization by election in 3,151 election-years between 1970 and 2019 across 178 countries and over 3,400 parties. We find that autocratization onset in election years is the result of (i) high authoritarian polarization; (ii) anti-pluralist ruling parties running elections without the presence of strong pluralist opposition; (iii) strong anti-pluralist political parties contesting against pluralist ruling parties. Our results are robust and stronger than alternative explanations, such as high levels of populism and affective polarization.	NA
2023	425	PE23	Unintended Consequences: The Authoritarian Legacy of Multiethnic Regime Engineering in Albania	It is clear in both legacy studies, and my fieldwork in Albania up to now, that conflicts over identity run higher in specific post-communist regions than others. However, the source of the variation is less clear. I propose that the source of this variation relates to whether the local communities experienced repression versus recognition of their identities during communism. Specifically, I hypothesize those whose ancestors experienced repression of their identities under communism became more likely to espouse anti-communist beliefs whereas those who were recognized, showed greater likelihood to transmit socialist values. I illustrate this process in the long run with original data on ethnopolitical identity markers curated during Albania’s entire national period (1914-2023) sourced by the civil registry, cemeteries, and election data.

2023	1239	CP02	Voter realignment in response to the selection of female lead candidates	Women have become increasingly visible and influential in politics over the past 50 years. In this paper, we focus on the electoral effects of the feminization of party leadership by studying electoral realignment in response to the selection of women as party leaders and lead candidates. We argue that the effects of parties’ choice of personnel from underrepresented groups unfolds via two avenues: First, as a signal of inclusion, it may broaden parties’ appeal to liberal voters; secondly, by group-specific descriptive representation, it allows parties’ to appeal to voters from specific demographic groups. We test the dynamic effects of the selection of female lead personnel using three empirical approaches: Changes in parties’ vote shares, general and gender-specific patterns of vote switching in comparative perspective, and a series of quasi-experimental case studies using multi-wave pre-election surveys. By producing new and nuanced insights into the electoral effects of parties’ choice of lead personnel, our findings yield notable implications at the intersection of party politics, party competition, and representation.

2023	1530	CP02	Gendered Policy Making? Access of female MPs to legislative committees in German State Legislatures	Much work has been done on the gender composition of parliaments but less is know about access and position of female MPs to/in parliamentary committees. These committees exert important policy-making powers in many parliamentary democracies. We show that access to committees is gendered, and women are less likely to become members and chairs of more important committees such as finance or economics. We argue that this gendered access is not merely explainable by factors such as competence, expertise and experience but also due to potential self-selection and discrimination. We propose theoretical and empirical ways to distinguish the two. We test our arguments with unique individual level data on MPs of the German Bundestag and state parliaments since 1948. Our results show that there is gender bias in access and composition of legislative committees that is somewhat mitigated by experience and expertise of MPs. Our results help linking aspects of descriptive representation of women and their ability to influence policy-decisions.	NA

2023	572	CP02	Can she do the job? Empirical evidence for unequal legislative oversight activities of MPs towards women and men ministers	While party gatekeepers’ prejudices towards women’s entrance to high-profile political posts attracted ample scholarly attention, considerably less is known about the challenges that women face if selected to an influential political post. This paper contributes to closing this research gap by answering the question as to what degree and why the oversight activities of MPs are influenced by the sex of ministers. We argue that women are overseen more tightly than men, because stereotypes about women’s inability to govern continue to shape the subconscious perception of women ministers by parliamentarians. To test this proposition, we study original data for the number, tone, and strength of questions of MPs to ministers in six European countries since the 1970s. The analysis focuses on instances of ministerial change between men and women within the same cabinet to uncover how the behavior of MPs adapts to the sex of the minister in charge. The results from a vector auto-regressive model suggest that MPs oversee women in government more thoroughly than men, albeit to varying degrees depending on their ideological stances.	NA
2023	573	CP02	Selecting and Ranking Female Candidates Under PR: Evidence from a Two-Stage Conjoint Experiment with Party Elites	Does gender affect candidate selection and list placement under proportional representation (PR)? Existing research argues that PR systems have a positive effect on women's representation due to a more inclusive candidate selection process. However, analyzing the actual process of candidate selection under PR before observing the final party-list is challenging and little is known about the preferences and strategies of party elites when selecting and ranking candidates. To address this problem, we conduct a novel two-stage conjoint experiment with party elites in Austria. The experiment allows us to analyze gendered patterns of candidate selection and list composition under PR. Our findings indicate that women have an advantage in the candidate selection process. However, a closer inspection reveals subtle, yet important, differences in gender selection preferences between male and female party elites. These findings have important implications for understanding patterns of female underrepresentation in PR systems.	NA
2023	1216	1216	International obligations and domestic support for fiscal consolidation	Over the past decade, EU Member States have agreed on restrictive fiscal policies within and outside EU architecture. Why do politicians sacrifice fiscal policy autonomy? As citizens sometimes oppose the consolidation of public finances, external constraints can become powerful tools in the hands of politicians to shift public opinion in favour of unpopular policies on their agenda. Evidence from the literature on public opinion toward climate change shows that international commitments increase citizens’ readiness to embrace costly policies. This suggests that during international negotiations policymakers can endorse international commitments that impose unpopular domestic measures. Yet, whether this logic also applies to fiscal policymaking remains understudied. To investigate whether international pledges influence domestic support for conservative fiscal policies, I carry out an original survey experiment in Italy. I measure support for a mix of tax increases and public spending cuts, presenting it as essential to comply with a new international obligation in the treatment group. Preliminary results suggest that support for fiscal consolidation increases when citizens are told that fiscal consolidation measures must be implemented to comply with an international rule.	NA
2023	1921	CP03	Much Ado About Debt? Understanding How People Reason About Debt Sustainability and Fiscal Policy	Existing evidence that majorities support debt reduction suggests, against common wisdom, that voters tilt the balance in favor of fiscal discipline. This paper revisits this evidence, focusing on quantities of interests other than majority preferences as traditionally measured in surveys. First, we investigate the existence of issue-specific subconstituencies, i.e., people who prioritize fiscal discipline over other issues. Second, we turn to framing asymmetry and examine whether voters tend to resist narratives describing high debt levels as sustainable while more willingly embracing narratives describing them as unsustainable. Third, we test for the existence of simple mental models that exist independently of partisan messaging and predispose voters to favor fiscal discipline. Using novel observational and experimental data from Great Britain, we find limited evidence that the public introduces a conservative bias to fiscal policy in these three ways. Our findings have implications for research on the fiscal politics of highly-indebted Western democracies.	NA
2023	734	CP03	What were they thinking? Anti-austerity voters and their turn towards radical parties	Research shows that many voters who disagree with fiscal austerity turn towards non-mainstream, often radical parties when the government adjusts fiscal policy. While these studies convincingly establish an empirical association between austerity and an increase in the vote share of radical parties, the underlying mechanisms that lead to these findings remain untested. Using original data from online survey experiments fielded in four key European countries, Germany, Britain, Spain and Portugal, our paper examines the reasons behind the decision of anti-austerity voters to turn towards radical parties. We expect that voters supporting radical parties, on average, perceive mainstream (left and right) parties as indistinguishable in their macro-economic policy offers. This is particularly true when the mainstream left implemented austerity while in government. Furthermore, we expect that supporters of radical parties believe that radical parties are less likely to implement austerity than mainstream parties and if radical parties support austerity, they believe that the burden of austerity to be shifted to outgroups.

2023	919	PE07	Spatial Inequality and Fiscal Conservatism in America	How does place of residence affect people’s politics? Despite the increasingly politicized nature of spatial inequalities, we still know little about its implications for redistributive preferences. We contend that when multiple jurisdictional levels exist, individuals’ preferences will be shaped by the extent to which taxing and spending at different levels will offer them a better deal. To examine this, we use data from the Cooperative Election Study (CES) matched with county-level demographic and economic data to study how differences between localities influence preferences toward taxation and spending at the state level within the United States. We find that voters are more likely to support state spending cuts when they live in counties that are richer and have higher local tax rates. In assessing the consequences of the 2008 economic downturn, we find that this gap between rich and poor places intensified after the onset of the recession. The paper demonstrates the importance of studying American politics with the analytic tools developed in the comparative political economy literature on fiscal federalism and provides new grounds as to why place matters.

2023	1763	CP04	Strategic Composition of Electoral Management Bodies in Autocracies: Evidence from Russia	Election fraud is known to accompany the election process in non-democratic regimes through various channels, one of them being the electoral management bodies (EMBs). Being in a position to impact the election process at multiple stages, starting from candidate registration to the vote counting during the election day, independent EMBs are critical for the fair administration of elections. Yet few studies to date have examined the process of EMBs’ formation and evaluated the impact of EMBs’ composition empirically. Using data on the composition of EMBs of different levels in Russia, with the lowest level including the commissions in over 89’000 polling stations, I show that, on the one hand, allocation of leadership positions within a commission varies systematically with the purpose of facilitating the performance of fraudulent practices. I also show that the EMBs’ composition does impact electoral outcomes in federal and regional elections and the degree of election manipulation prior to election day. This study thus speaks to the growing literature on electoral malpractice as well as research on election monitoring.	NA
2023	1897	CP04	Electoral institutions, malapportionment and the representation of ethnic minorities	Have electoral institutions, and particularly legislative apportionment, been employed as an institutional tool to restraint the rights of certain minority political groups and ethnic minorities? Existent literature has shown that PR favour non-concentrated small minority groups and minority groups that are not the majority of the population in a territory; in turn, majoritarian systems have been shown to be beneficial for minority groups sufficiently concentrated in certain districts. In this paper we deep on the conditions under which electoral systems favour/restraint minority voices by adding up legislative apportionment in the equation. Using data on malapportionment from nearly 20.000 electoral districts in 65 democratic countries between 1995 and 2020, and ethnic data from the GrowUP project, the paper firstly shows that districts with ethnic minorities are benefitted by malapportionment. We subsequently aim at breaking down this relationship to understand whether and in which conditions malapportionment has been used as a strategy to favour/restraint minority voices. We finally assess historical changes in electoral systems in the word to understand the different mechanisms used to give voice or conceal ethnic minorities.	NA
2023	1904	1904	How do electoral reforms influence legislative turnover? Quasi-experimental evidence from municipality elections in Poland	The existing literature has identified a number of electoral system features affecting legislative turnover. However, it has not been studied yet what is the impact of electoral reforms as such. In this paper, I study a unique series of electoral reforms in Polish municipality councils allowing to distinguish the effects of an electoral system from those of an electoral reform. I exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by a population threshold assigning municipalities to different systems. I show that incumbents elected in proportional elections struggle to adapt to majoritarian elections. However, a similar phenomenon does not occur when system changes from a proportional to a majoritarian one. This is because when districts become smaller, incumbents do not sort to avoid competition against each other. In turn, I do not find any effect of the reforms on selection into candidacy nor voters’ behaviour. The results show that electoral reforms have different impact on the success of incumbents, depending on the previously applied electoral system, and call for more attention to the one-shot consequences of reforms, in contrast with effects of electoral systems.

2023	264	CP04	Who Counts? Malapportionment and the Overrepresentation of Urban Interests	Existing research argues that malapportionment primarily favors rural areas,resulting in conservative biases of electoral systems. In this paper, we providea radically different perspective on the study of geographical overrepresentationby identifying the institutional design under which urban and left-leaningareas benefit from malapportionment. We argue that if reapportionment isbased on total population rather than citizens, the representation of urban areasincreases disproportionally due to the inflow and geographical sorting of migrants.Empirically, we use sub-national data from twelve established democraciesto forward evidence that population-based reapportionment mechanismsand migrant flows are linked to higher malapportionment of urban and leftleaningregions. Moreover, using municipality-level data of a popular votefrom Switzerland, we demonstrate that voters’ ideological leanings are a strongpredictor of support for population-based rather than citizen-based reapportionmentmechanisms. Our findings suggest that the impact of malapportionmenton political representation and public policies might be more heterogeneousthan previously thought.	NA

However, specific measures of the partisan bias created by malapportionment are still lacking. Relying on data from lower-house elections in Argentina and Spain, two countries employing multimember districts and with high levels of malapportionment, we use a regression discontinity design to capture the over(under)representation of parties generated by malapportionment.

2023	165	165	The Power of Mismatch: What We Can Learn from Chinese University Students’ Inconsistence in Ideology?	Ideology was a under studied topic in authoritarian regimes. Through an original dataset and interviews from Mainland China students studied in Macau, the present study intends to explore the ideology pattern of China’s young generation with specific attention to the so-called “link pink”. We have the follow findings. First, we found a significant inconsistence in pro-regime students’ subjective perception and objective measurement in ideology. Second, the common democracy-authoritarianism dichotomy can’t well describe students’ ideology spectrum. Third, as China’s official ideology particularly emphasized performance legitimacy, we have evidence that even for the pro-regime students that they raised suspicious on the status quo under China’s strict pandemic control policy. In short, we believe our findings contributed to the understanding on several important questions in Chinese politics such as the political ideology of the young generation, the raised of the “link pink” and their evaluation on the regime performance.

2023	173	CP05	Personalism and International Conflict: How Dictators Fight to Concentrate Power	What is the effect of international conflict on the degree of personalism? We know that personalist rulers in dictatorships are more likely to engage and initiate conflicts, yet we do not know if this has further implications: if conflict helps dictators to accumulate more power. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, both theoretically and empirically. I argue that dictators use conflict to increase their levels of personalism: the explanation can be found in the struggles over power of dictators vis-à-vis the elites, this is, in the domestic political environment. When dictators engage in international conflicts, they fight to personalise. Thus, international conflict is understood as a coup-proofing strategy and is a solution to the guardianship dilemma. I test the arguments by conducting a synthetic control method using novel data on personalism (which is understood as a latent dimension of autocratic rule), of a sample of dictatorships in the period 1946-2010. I find that dictators concentrate power after the onset of international wars.	NA
2023	185	CP05	Smarter Autocrats: What Autocrats Learn from Other Countries’ Political Protests	What do autocrats learn from other countries’ protests? Studies on counter-diffusion focus on the autocrats’ efforts to prevent the diffusion of protests. We argue that dictators can pay attention to other countries’ regime contention without the possibility of a diffusion. Dictators suffer from an information problem regarding their population control. In facing the problem, autocrats use heuristics: heuristics of representativeness (HR) and availability (HA). Other countries’ popular mobilization can be a useful information source for dictators. We argue that autocrats are more likely to reference political protests in similar regimes (HR). Similar regimes use similar policies and internal security system to control populations. If they experience a popular mobilization, that indicates that those system do not function well. We also claim that autocrats in the same dependence network are more likely to reference political protests of regimes within the network (HA). Through the communication lines developed within the network, information is more available. With spatial modeling, this study reveals the authoritarian public sphere in which autocrats use information shortcuts to make inferences about their populations and strengthen their rules.	NA
2023	558	CP05	Purges or reshuffles? Elite management strategies and autocratic survival	How do autocrats reduce elite threats to their survival? Most accounts of authoritarian politics focus on the logic of power-sharing between the ruler and elite as a dominant theme using aggregate measures of institutionalization and repression. Yet, existing explanations and measures cannot capture the time-varying and more dynamic strategies that autocrats use to manage elites in their ruling coalition. We propose a theoretical distinction between horizontal and vertical autocratic elite management strategies. The former captures the reshuffling of elites to reduce their power and coordination opportunities, while maintaining the composition and size of the ruling coalition largely intact. The latter captures purges to eliminate elite members from the ruling coalition altogether, to prevent challenges. We argue that purges tend to have adverse effects by reducing an autocratic leader's survival in office, while reshuffles have the opposite effect by increasing autocrats survival in office. We test these propositions using novel measures of cabinet purges and reshuffles in autocratic cabinets between 1966 and 2020, and supplement it with studies of elite management in two representative dictatorships.

2023	69	CP05	Student selection as a strategy of autocratic rule: Evidence from university admissions in the former German Democratic Republic	Universities are often a fertile soil for anti-regime protests in dictatorships. At the same time, dictators require a skilled workforce to ensure economic productivity. Autocrats can counter this dilemma through indoctrination and repression. But both strategies are costly and prone to inefficiencies. I propose a third strategy autocrats use to resolve the protest/productivity trade-off: strategic student admission. By admitting more loyal students, indoctrination becomes easier and monitoring less costly. To counter efficiency problems, however, autocrats enforce admission criteria selectively: they value loyalty signals more in fields with a higher potential of generating dissent---history, arts, or culture---and less strongly in fields less prone to critical thinking and more relevant for economic productivity---medicine, technology, or sciences. I find empirical support for this hypothesis using fine-grained, individual-level admission records from more than 500,000 university applications in the former German Democratic Republic. Results are robust to accounting for strategic applicant choices and corroborated by a natural experiment created by the regime's downfall in 1989/90. The study unpacks a key strategy of autocratic survival and has important implications for theories of democratization.	NA
2023	1235	CP15	Asserting Autonomy: Strategic Investment in State Capacity in Opposition Local Governments in Autocracies	How do opposition local governments (LGs) change how autocrats manage competition? How can opposition LGs resist regime attempts to hamstring them? Opposition LGs change the strategic interaction between opposition parties and regimes because local state capacity gives opposition politicians the agency to act autonomously. Opposition LGs invest in local state capacity to reduce dependency on the regime which allows them to act in defiance of the regime from within the state. This allows opposition LGs to assert their autonomy despite the systematic and ad hoc disadvantages imposed on them, making it harder for autocrats to control political competition. I draw on interviews with local politicians and bureaucrats to analyze shifts in the strategic interaction between opposition-led LGs and the regime in Tanzania between 2005 and 2018. Using a novel dataset of taxation and transfers from 2010-2017, I show that opposition LGs invest more in local fiscal capacity and that this difference is particularly stark during crackdowns on opposition parties. I contend that this strategic investment in state capacity allows opposition parties to survive despite repeated attempts to undermine them.	NA

However, little is known 1) whether these programs can be conducted online (instead of traditionally in-person) and 2) whether there are contextual differences in the impact of these interventions. Our project aims to answer these questions through online experiments, which will be conducted in 30 countries, representing varying levels of democratic and economic development. Respondents will be recruited via social media and will be randomly shown one of three treatment videos, promoting different aspects of democracy (civic rights, separation of power, provision of economic and public goods) or a placebo treatment, before answering a series of questions about their understanding and support for democracy and autocracy. We expect that the national context of respondents to influence the impact of our interventions, whereby the effects should be strongest if respondents face a democratic or developmental deficit. Our study will be the most comprehensive study ever conducted in the field of civic education, allowing us to explore why democracy promotion works better in some countries than others.	NA
2023	1602	CP15	Moral Challenges to Democracy: The Role of Elites in Shifting Democratic Social Norms	From the normalization of radical right attitudes to the erosion of anti-racist norms, recent scholarship has shown the crucial role of political leaders in shifting social norms. However, we still know little about elites' role in democratic backsliding through this social norm perspective. This article addresses this gap by analyzing the role of political elites in shifting democratic social norms using a computational text analysis approach. Studying over 3 million tweets of elected officials in four established democracies, this article contributes to the literature by introducing the first-to-date dictionary of democratic norms at the elite level. Preliminary evidence using this approach supports a shift in elites' use of democratic norms in their direct communications, both in terms of the frequency of normative and moral democratic stances and in the type of norm categories they refer to. This paper further explores the cross-national variations of this normative shift and highlights the interaction of mainstream and challenger elites as a key factor. Overall, these findings show the important role of elites in challenging established democratic norms.	NA
2023	2023	CP15	Subjective Political Inequality	The growing literature on political inequality has mainly taken the form of country studies. This is primarily because of the large amount of information required to estimate congruence of policy-making with group preferences. At the same time, there is a wealth of easily available international information on subjective political influence from opinion surveys. Researchers have been unwilling to use these data to study political inequality because of uncertainty about what it may measure. We use these data to study inequality in perceived political influence in an international perspective, bringing together measures from different opinion surveys. We compute subjective political inequality as the difference in perceptions of responsiveness between socio-economic groups. We find that this measure is remarkable consistent, with country correlation across surveys of around 0.65. At the same time, this subjective measure is unrelated to “objective” measures, such as the political inequality variable from V-Dem and measures form Lupu and Warner. We then examine micro drivers of subjective political inequality decomposing it into the contributions of different inputs of political participation, such as voting, protesting, or contacting politicians.

2023	448	CP15	Litigating and Adjudicating Electoral Disputes in Hybrid Regimes: Evidence from Zambia	Courts in backsliding and hybrid regimes are increasingly asked to settle electoral disputes. What explains the judicialization of elections in such regimes and to what extent do their courts adjudicate electoral disputes free from political influence? We argue that in hybrid regimes, mounting legal challenges against the elections of opposition candidates can be a strategy through which executives try to consolidate control over the legislature following narrow electoral victories. Moreover, executive dominance over the judiciary creates pressures for judges to adjudicate in line with executive interests. Yet, as long as executive survival is not at stake, the executive may be reluctant to openly attack the judiciary, thus allowing judges some space for independently adjudicating electoral disputes. We investigate the politics of electoral disputes using a novel dataset of electoral petitions following the 2011, 2016, and 2021 Zambian elections.	NA
2023	1320	CP16	The more things change, the more they stay the same? Using class-specific MCA to compare Belgian political spaces	Decades of disconsonant electoral trends among Belgium’s two regions of Flanders and Francophone Belgium have left researchers speculating on the exact roots of their socio-political differences. Marked by discrepancies in occupational structure, political attitudes and electorally separated through the existence of two distinctive party systems, these deviations have traditionally been attributed to variations in the cleavage structures of both polities. This paper advances an innovative methodology of class-specific multiple correspondence analysis (CSA) to compare both subspaces in a single methodological approach. Substantially, after verifying that ideological dimensions are structured similarly in the two regions, I find empirical evidence suggesting the existence of two cleavages: a ‘universalism-particularism’ cleavage, which cross-cuts traditional social divisions on the basis of education, income and subnational identity; and a second, less obvious ‘economic’ cleavage. In Francophone Belgium, the universalism-particularism cleavage has not managed to structure the party system because left-wing parties kept appealing to their core working-class constituents. By contrast, the Flemish left has steered away from these voters, leaving the left-authoritarian segment of their electorate to the far-right.	NA
2023	1421	CP16	Substantive and descriptive representation of rural citizens in Europe	Research has extensively explored the substantive and descriptive representation of social groups based on gender, income, ethnicity, education, or age. However, despite mounting evidence of differences in political attitudes and behavior between cities and the countryside in several advanced democracies, a frequently overlooked aspect in this field is place-based representation along the rural-urban divide. This paper seeks to close this gap by developing and testing an analytical framework that addresses the methodological challenges involved in measuring this form of representation both in substantive and descriptive terms. Our empirical contribution is threefold. First, we use cross-national public and expert survey data to analyze the convergence between parties’ and voters’ issue positions depending on the degree of urbanization of the latter’s place of residence. Second, we assess how well national parliaments mirror the rural-urban composition of populations in several European countries. Finally, drawing on data from a unique survey in Spain, we examine citizens’ perceptions of the rural-urban provenance of elected officials and how such perceptions relate to political satisfaction and support for correcting measures.

2023	232	CP16	Mapping the Rural-Urban Divide in Europe:The role of socio-political clusters for issue polarization and vote choice	The rise of right-wing populism and political conflict is often related to the (re-) emergence of a divide between the “left-behinds” in rural areas and the educational elite in metropolitan areas. Based upon the concept of a political cleavage we contend that a cleavage is present when certain social groups share common values and attitudes and when these are mobilized by particular parties. We argue that shared social characteristics amplify potential geographic divides. If people in certain types of places are socially similar to each other and different from people in other types of places, we expect greater in-group homogeneity and larger out-group heterogeneity in issue preferences and value orientations. Such a bi-polarity based on geography and the related similarity in social characteristics fuels issue polarization and, subsequently, differences in voting behaviour. Using the last wave of the European Social Survey (ESS 2018), we apply cluster analyses and multilevel regression techniques to examine i) how place of living is linked to similarity in social attributes and ii) how this place based social similarity contributes to issue polarization and vote choice.

2023	358	CP16	Partisan Districting and the Adoption of Proportional Representation: Gerrymandering and its Discontents	Electoral engineering strategies in majoritarian electoral systems, in particular the possibility to contain insurgent parties by manipulating electoral districts for partisan gain, are key determinants of parties’ position on the adoption of proportional representation (PR). Providing both qualitative and quantitative evidence, this paper demonstrates that partisan districting can be an effective strategy to protect incumbent parties’ dominant political position. In addition, it shows how insurgent parties push for the adoption of PR to end the practice of partisan districting. Finally, it demonstrates that incumbents – in the face of increasing electoral threats – cling to the existing majoritarian system if partisan districting allows them to influence vote-seat distortions in their favor. Together, these findings suggest that the possibility to contain insurgent parties by means of partisan districting is an important but overlooked alternative to the adoption of PR. Moreover, by demonstrating that vote-seat distortions moderate the relationship between district-level electoral threats and legislators’ support for PR adoption, this paper offers an important corrective to Stein Rokkan’s influential electoral threat thesis	NA
2023	748	CP16	The Political Geography of Satisfaction with Democracy	While a substantial literature explores the drivers of satisfaction with democracy, the potential effects of geography on this political attitude have so far been ignored. Both centre-periphery and urban-rural dynamics have substantial potential for influencing the extent to which voters are satisfied with democratic rule, yet we know little about the functioning and effects of such dynamics. Seeking to overcome this lacuna, we combine CSES survey data with measures of geographical centrality to explore how the distance of a respondent’s electoral constituency from the national capital influences levels of satisfaction with democracy. Using data covering 16 countries over a period of 25 years, we find that distance between the electoral district and the national capital lowers satisfaction with democracy. Yet, we also show that an interactive relationship exists between geographical distance and habitat size, with distance to the capital having a less negative effect in larger habitats. We further explore the political effects of this apparent geographical isolation and find that distance to the capital also lowers turnout.	NA
2023	1056	CP17	Elite responsiveness to protest in Latin America: evidence from protest event data and political representatives on Twitter	Protesters have successfully taken to the streets across Latin America to demonstrate against multiple issues since 2019. This is a sustained trend in which some demands attained the desired policy responses and others have been repressed or ignored. We look into communicative or rhetorical responses of political elites as key intermediate outcomes of protest. Our analyses focus on two dimensions of responsiveness: the representatives’ willingness to (1) acknowledge the protesters, (2) engage with their specific concerns, and to (3) consider their demands by pushing the issues into the agenda. Using original data from protest events and tweets from representatives in four countries, between 2012 and 2022, we use computational linguistics techniques to measure direct responses to protest events and changes on issue attention by political elites. Our comparative results point to the importance of the national contexts, political systems, and how they interact with the attributes of the protesters and the events. Responsiveness to street politics in the Latin American context is central to understand the political inclusion of minorities, attention to crises, and the electoral support of progressive governments.

2023	1102	CP17	The Seldomness of Unequal Responsiveness: A reexamination of two parliamentary democracies	In contrast to canonical models of political competition, some recent research suggests that public policy in advanced democracies disproportionately reflects the preferences of affluent citizens. Using a research design developed by Gilens's study of the United States, substantial inequality in policy responsiveness have been found in different European countries. We reanalyse and extend two of such studies from Germany and the Netherlands. Our analysis reveals that unequal responsiveness transpires on very rare occasions. First, the affluent hold a substantively different minority position in only ca. 16 percent of the recorded public opinion surveys. Second, the predictive power of the affluent's policy preferences is only limited. This constraint hold for the published models as well as for models that account for preferences among different groups and differences across policy domains in the sampled data. Our results underline the need to further investigate the link between public opinion among groups and policy responsiveness, given their substantive importance for democratic governance.	NA
2023	1537	CP17	Are representatives' fairness preferences representative? A comparative of American and Norwegian elected representatives	In the context of developed democracies, the United States and Scandinavian countries are typically contrasted with each other, with the United States having very high income inequality and Scandinavian countries having more compressed income distributions. Research shows that is that Americans and Norwegians differ in their views of whether an income inequality is believed to be fair or unfair, and the moral status of luck compared to merit. This paper focuses on politicians in the US and Norway to study causally whether and to what extent redistribution behaviour reflect representatives' views on i) luck, merit, and efficiency as sources of income inequality and ii) whether these views are representative of citizens’ in these two countries. Making distributive choices in identical situations, we find that American politicians accept significantly more inequality than Norwegian politicians. Merit as opposed to luck as the source of inequality causes a large increase in elites' inequality acceptance in both countries, with a stronger effect in the US. Moreover, Norwegian politicians are more efficiency-seeking than are American.	NA
2023	2022	CP17	Political inequality in local politics	The increase in economic inequality in recent decades has invigorated academic attention to political inequality. Seminal studies have documented significantly more responsiveness to the preferences of the rich in the US and several European countries. Thus far, this literature mostly studies preference congruence in national-level formal. However, in many countries in the Global South citizens obtain key outputs at the local level (mostly service improvements) that are as or more relevant to them than national level policies. We present a pilot project on political inequality at the local level in Brazil and South Africa. We use information on neighborhood level municipal resource allocation and combine these with census data to assess which socio-economic groups benefit from municipal resources. In a second step, we assess how the observed patterns relate to political inputs such as participation in consultation processes, protest, or electoral turnout. Whereas we will eventually extend this analysis to close to 250 municipalities in both countries, this paper seeks to evaluate and validate the proposed measure of local level inequality with a smaller number of cases.

2023	933	CP09	When and why do Parties Respond to Protest? German Parties’ responsiveness to environmental protests.	When do parties respond to protests? A growing body of literature studies the extent to which elites respond to protests, finding mixed results. This paper explores the conditions under which political parties are more likely to respond to protests. We do so by exploring three key expectations in the literature: i. the role of being in power or opposition, ii. that of party ideology and alignment with the protest and iii. that of electoral threat. We test for these using difference-in-differences and regression-discontinuity in time designs on geocoded data on environmental protests, which we combine with party press from 2018-2021. We explore variation in state-level cabinet status in Germany to explore the role of parties’ cabinet status and use state-of-the-art quantitative text analysis to explore the mechanisms of when and how parties respond to protests. Overall, this study’s findings contribute to our understanding of not just whether but when and how parties respond to protests.	NA
2023	1045	CP18	Perceived Intergenerational Mobility and Populism Support	In recent decades, there is an increased perception of intergenerational downward mobility, that is, an extended belief that younger cohorts keep lower standards of living than their parents. We study the influence of such views on populist attitudes and the support for populist parties. We argue that perceived intergenerational socioeconomic decline enhances populism support. Drawing on data from a survey conducted in nine European countries, we explore to what extent expected intergenerational downward mobility correlates with populist attitudes and support for populist parties on both extremes of the ideological spectrum. We find that respondents who say they are worse than their parents when they were respondents’ current age are indeed more likely to support populist attitudes and vote for populist parties.	NA
2023	1144	CP18	Is All Inequality Equal?	Macro-studies find that ethnic group-level economic inequalities are particularly likely to lead collective grievances, protest mobilization, and violent conflict compared with individual-level inequalities. Yet we have a very limited micro-evidence of these relationships. We argue that people are more likely to experience feelings of injustice and change their attitudes and behavior, when considering socioeconomic disparity at the group-level. Well-powered framing experiments in the United States, Bolivia, and Nigeria (N=4,800) demonstrate that priming respondents to think about social disparity in group terms causes respondents to perceive inequality as more unfair. Second, behavior games in the United States (N=1600) show that respondents are more supportive of redistributive policies when economic disparity coincides with group identities, but only if they are from a disadvantaged group. Finally, a set of 2x2 factorial experiments test the proposed mechanism by independently varying deservingness cues and group (vs. individual) inequality. Overall, our findings suggest that disadvantage is particularly likely to lead to grievances and support for remedial policies when economic inequality and ethnic identities line up.	NA
2023	2043	2043	The Gender Generation Gap in Preferences for Social Spending and Redistribution: A Comparative Analysis	Women have been found to be more supportive of redistribution and social spending across established, Western, democracies. The size of these gender gaps varies across time and space, and yet, the comparative literature on attitudinal gender gaps has largely neglected the role of the generational dimension and the political and policy context when it comes to accounting for this variation. In this paper, we look at both the generational and systemic influences on gender differences in attitudes towards redistribution and social spending. Broader contexts and welfare systems should be relevant for understanding attitudinal gender gaps in preferences for social spending and redistribution since women’s greater support for these measures is in theory linked to their greater reliance on welfare services, and so the manner and extent to which these are provided should affect demand in a gendered way. Using comparative survey data from European and Anglo-American democracies, we examine how the broader context impacts on the gender generation gap in support for redistribution and social spending.

2023	294	CP18	Regional Inequality and Anti-Democratic Preferences	The questions motivating this paper are: 1) is political support more affected by individual or regional inequalities? And 2) what is the interaction between the two? Disentangling the independent and joint effects of individual and regional inequality allows us to test novel hypotheses on why local contexts affect individual attitudes. Our theoretical and empirical setup distinguishes between income-maximisation motivations (relative purchasing power or prospects of social mobility) or social integration mechanisms (social distrust, social status, or perceptions of social unfairness) as potential mechanisms to explain the effect of individual economic circumstances across declining or well-performing local contexts. To test our hypotheses, we draw on a large-scale, original, and randomised survey experiment in Great Britain. After gathering fine-grained pre-treatment income distributions at the household and local level, respondents are randomized into treatments highlighting objective household and regional inequality levels and changes, as well as subjective inequality levels. Preliminary analyses suggest that regional inequality levels are stronger predictors of anti-democratic and populist attitudes than individual conditions (i.e. sociotropic mechanism) and that subjective perceptions of local contexts are more powerful than objective information.

2023	869	CP18	Explaining the Redistribution Gap: Inequality, Tax Policy Design, and Ideology	Redistribution efforts have lagged behind the long-term increase in inequality observable in most democracies. We investigate three explanations for this redistribution gap: a widespread insensitivity to inequality, weak preferences over the equalization potential of tax plans, and limited updating of tax reforms' perceived ideological positions. We devise several experiments creating exogenous variation in the level and structure of inequality and tax policy design that we field to samples of the adult population in Denmark, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Individuals are slightly more supportive of taxing the rich as inequality increases. Moreover, mass preferences strongly depend on the equalization potential of tax reforms: individuals value more progressivity, low tax intensity, and poor-friendliness. However, neither contextual nor self-centered inequality systematically change these sensitivities. Inequality also fails to induce meaningful shifts in the perceived ideological positions of tax reforms. We leverage these results to perform a stochastic frontier analysis identifying the relationship between tax reforms' equalization impact and public support. We find that there exist politically feasible tax reforms whose equalization potential exceeds that of the status quo.	NA
2023	1059	CP19	Which Policy Mix Boosts Naturalization Most? The Interactive Effect of Immigration and Citizenship Regimes on Immigrants’ Nationality Acquisition	Classical normative theory assumes that to retain their legitimacy democracies should maximize the inclusion of long-term immigrant residents, and it is often assumed that this can be achieved by combining selective immigration policies with inclusive citizenship policies. In this paper, we explore to what extent greater selectiveness in immigration indeed amplifies the effect of (more) inclusive citizenship. Our empirical analysis uses observational survey data from the European Social Survey (ESS) to identify first-generation immigrants and combines the information about the timing of immigration with the policies they were exposed to when entering (immigration; measured using the IMPIC dataset) and the citizenship policies the encounter when they are at risk of naturalization (citizenship requirements after fulfilling the residence requirement; measured using the CITRIX dataset). We then move on to analyzing targeted sub-samples and employ various designs to reduce endogeneity concerns. Preliminary observational analyses support the empirical claim in the normative literature: the increase in naturalization propensities is greatest when immigrants are exposed to both relatively closed immigration regimes and relatively inclusive citizenship regimes.

2023	1177	CP19	How Do Boundaries and Barriers in Domestic Migration Influence Political Participation?	Scholars have paid a great deal of attention to the importance of differences in physical boundaries and social barriers in international migration, but they have largely overlooked how variation in these boundaries and barriers affect domestic migration. In this paper we consider how subnational variation in the ease of migrants to move into communities (i.e., boundaries) and to cooperate with others once arrived (i.e., barriers) affects migrants' political participation. The paper draws on unique, extensive datasets of household and elite surveys, including over 20,000 individuals in nearly 2,400 localities of Malawi and Zambia. It shows that boundaries and barriers predict differences in the likelihoods that migrants are 1) registered to vote in the village and 2) likely to vote in alignment with the local leader. Moreover, it finds little reason to expect that selection into the neighborhood fully drives these effects. The results call upon both scholars and policymakers to better understand how subnational variation in the conditions migrants face affects political participation.	NA
2023	1353	CP19	Mass Attitudes Towards Immigrants in Developing Country Contexts	Existing scholarship regularly demonstrates how mass attitudes towards immigrants in receiving countries are sensitive to those immigrants’ characteristics. Identifying these patterns of preferences matters because they relate to the kinds of economic and symbolic threats that theoretically shape immigration public opinion. Yet most evidence comes from high-income contexts displaying clear distinctions between immigrant and native populations. This potentially limits the scope of existing theorization. By contrast, we focus on low- and middle-income settings where immigrants often come from neighboring, and similar, countries—much more typical of global migration flows. Specifically, we present pre-registered conjoint experimental evidence from Colombia and Peru that asked respondents to evaluate potential Venezuelan immigrants who held varying characteristics. At the aggregate level, Colombians held more permissive attitudes compared to Peruvians. Peruvians were also more likely than Colombians to distinguish Venezuelans by their legal status and ethnicity with respect to admission. We also consider several moderating factors, including social contact, political ideology, and being negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our results contribute to the limited body of immigration public opinion scholarship beyond high-income settings.	NA
2023	36	CP19	Pandemic Politics in the Arab Gulf States: Attitudes toward State Policies and Foreign Migration in Kuwait and Qatar	This paper compares public attitudes toward state pandemic policies and the future of foreign migration in Kuwait and Qatar, oil-rich countries that pursued similar lockdown strategies but adopted different rhetorical positions regarding openness to a globalized labor force. While Kuwaiti political elites intensified anti-foreign discourse during the pandemic, Qatari state spokesmen articulated continued reliance and support for expatriate workers -- with implications for societal attitudes toward foreign workers. Kuwaiti nationals expressed lower levels of overall support for future migration than Qataris, both when asked directly and as part of a conjoint experiment that controlled for migrant co-ethnicity and skill level. And while nationals in both Kuwait and Qatar were satisfied with their states' response to the pandemic, Arab expatriate workers in Kuwait expressed lower levels of approval for state policy than those in Qatar. We consider two explanations for the differential elite response to future migration -- the first linked to populist rhetoric associated with Kuwaiti electoral politics and the second connected to Qatar's state-building drive and associated preparations for the 2022 World Cup.

2023	509	CP19	Nationalist Education at the Country of Origin and Immigrant Assimilation at the Destination	What is the role of education in the country of origin for immigrants’ incorporation intheir final destinations? Some scholars have argued that mass schooling with nationalcontent will produce durable identities that are hard to change. Such a mechanismcan hinder educated immigrants’ assimilation into a new national group. On the otherhand, state curricula impact socialization, teaching individuals how to comply withsocial norms and the authority of the state which may be transferable to other countrycontexts, promoting integration. In this project, we test these hypotheses in the contextof European migration to the US in the early 20th century. We exploit the staggeredintroduction of mass schooling with national content across European countries andthe differential timing of immigrants’ arrival to the US in order to examine how nationalist education affects various aspects of integration including citizenship acquisition,exogamy, and naming patterns for immigrant children.

2023	923	CP20	Changing political principals and the ideological orientation of street-level bureaucrats	Are street-level bureaucrats politically neutral, or are political principals able to shape the ideological orientation of the civil service over time? This paper investigates how changes in the partisan composition in government affect the political views and party preferences of stree-level bureaucrats. The research design uses the fact that most street-level bureaucrats in Germany are employed by their respective Bundesland, and elections to subnational parliaments that lead to a change in government composition can therefore be used to isolate the effect of a change in political principal – while holding the general political climate constant, as these changes only affect some, but not all, civil servants. The analysis uses a difference-in-difference model and monthly German Politbarometer survey data from 1977 to 2019 to estimate the effect of government turnover on the political views of street-level bureaucrats compared to those unaffected by the change in principal. The results indicate that there is indeed an increase in support for the (new) government parties among civil servants, but this ‘bureaucratic honeymoon’ may be short-lived.	NA
2023	942	CP20	The Bureaucratic Shuffle: The Politicisation of Appointments in Pakistan	Bureaucratic staffing is key to managing state performance and service delivery (Hassan 2021; McDonnell 2020; Brierley 2020; Grindle 2012). We know less about why and how politicians and bureaucrats in hybrid regimes seek to regulate bureaucratic appointments, though it has great significance for bureaucratic and party politics and variations in capacity within such states. Using the case of Pakistan and drawing on data from interviews, semi-participant observation, and newspaper archives, I argue that politicians and bureaucrats counter political uncertainty by using bureaucratic appointments to regulate patronage and achieve electoral benefits, personal gains, protection, and bureaucratic performance. However, their ability to do so varies based on four factors: political capital; the curation of patronage relationships; the outcome sought; and the process by which the appointment is made. While extra-legal appointments are most likely to ensure success across these variables, there is significant disparity in experiences of the state across politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens. My findings have implications for understanding politician-bureaucrat interactions, the strategic management of political uncertainty, and sub-national variation in state capacity in hybrid regimes.

2023	1829	CP21	Case complexity and the study of strategic behaviour at highest courts: The choice and implications of different measurement strategies to quantify case complexity.	Case complexity is a key predictor in many studies of judicial politics. In particular, case complexity is used to explain judicial behaviour towards politics and society. However, the definition and operationalization of case complexity is underdeveloped. Scholars propose different ways to specify case complexity based on linguistic features, types of decisions or issue areas. Yet, we know very little about the assumptions guiding different operationalizations and their substantive implications. This article presents an in-depth discussion of different concepts of case complexity to explain how case complexity influences the strategic interaction of highest courts and public actors. First, the article presents how different measures of case complexity are supported theoretically by legal and political research. Second, the different measurements are assessed empirically for two archetypical highest courts: The German Federal Constitutional Court and the United States Supreme Court. To understand how different operationalization affect the study of judicial behaviour, the impact of briefs on transparency-inducing action by judges is analyzed. The results have major implications for studies on judicial behaviour and its implications for the strategic behaviour at highest courts.	NA
2023	1944	CP21	Legal Pluralism and Fragmented Sovereignty: A Survey Experiment in Iraq	Where state and non-state legal orders coexist within the same territory, what factors determine individual preferences among alternative providers of justice? Through a series of vignette experiments conducted among Sunni Arabs in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where the population has long been exposed to numerous justice systems (Islamic, tribal, and state), this research fills a gap in the extant research by causally identifying factors across different cases that drive selection of one system over another. Disputes within the family are generally directed towards customary orders, though participants prefer that more costly cases go to the state system. Sectarian outgroup dynamics are not as impactful as might be expected. Observational analyses demonstrate that Iraqis face a difficult choice between a highly corrupt, but highly powerful state system and less enforceable, seemingly less corrupt non-state orders. Women and respondents with lower-income tend to prefer non-state forums, which might be a result of structural inequalities.	NA
2023	798	CP21	Can International Courts Weaken Support for Democratic Backsliding? Experimental Evidence from Hungary	In response to the growing specter of democratic backsliding, a new potential champion for the defense of democracy has emerged: international courts. Whether international courts can effectively halt democratic decay, however, is far from clear as these institutions are often seen as lacking the capacity to compel governments into changing their behavior. We argue that international courts can serve as potential protectors of democracy by galvanizing public opposition to democratic backsliding policies, particularly among citizens who trust the international court and value the international legal regime it represents. To evaluate our argument, we conducted an experiment embedded in a nationally-representative survey of 2000 respondents in Hungary. We presented respondents with one of two hypothetical anti-democratic policies which was subsequently invalidated either by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the Hungarian Constitutional Court, the Hungarian Constitutional Court based on an opinion by the CJEU, or was not evaluated by any court. Our findings indicate that a CJEU decision weakened citizens’ support for anti-democratic policies, albeit to a similar degree as a national court decision.	NA
2023	965	CP21	The Power of Words: Strategic judicial opinion-writing to influence politics and society	How do justices manage the transparency surrounding their decisions through strategic opinion-writing? To ensure compliance with decisions justices require public support. The more transparent the environment, the more likely the public becomes aware of judicial decisions and of political threats to noncompliance. Contrary to prior research, we conceptualize transparency as a continuous dimension, which justices manage through the way they write opinions and press releases. To assess this argument we analyze Senate decisions and press releases published by the German Constitutional Court. We argue that commonly employed scoring approaches to readability are insufficient to disentangle the Court’s strategic management of transparency. Instead, transparency is achieved by easily readable decisions. Easily readable decisions are not only shorter but rely on vocabulary broadly understood. Applying novel tools of Natural Language Processing we finding that the more complex a judicial opinion, the more likely it is supplemented by a press release. Moreover, the combination of readability and choice of vocabulary explains media coverage of decisions. The findings have major implications for our understanding of how courts strategically manage transparency surrounding their decisions.	NA
2023	1851	1851	Preventing or provoking violence against civilians? How different types of rebel groups respond to naming & shaming by the UN Security Council	What is the impact of naming & shaming on rebel violence against civilians? I argue that the response of rebel groups to naming & shaming depends on how deterrable these groups are. Rebel groups with a political wing, an embassy abroad, high support from the domestic population or a democratic external supporter, are relatively more deterrable as they are reliant on the domestic and international community. Naming & shaming decreases civilian victimization by these groups as they want to avoid legal and economic punishment or the loss of support. In contrast, rebel groups with access to lootable resources, with an autocratic external supporter or those that rely on forced funding are less deterrable as they are generally less reliant on the domestic population or the support of international actors that value the protection of civilians. Moreover, naming & shaming further isolates and threatens these groups, leading them to escalate violence to immediately improve their military capacity. Using new monthly data on naming & shaming of rebel groups by the UN Security Council, I find strong empirical support for these arguments.	NA
2023	197	CP22	Terrorism, perpetrators and polarization: evidence from natural experiments	We analyze whether affective polarization -- the extent to which citizens feel sympathy towards partisan in-groups and antagonism towards partisan out-groups -- can be aggravated by terrorism violence. Terrorist attacks intensify pre-existing ideological worldviews and partisan leanings and bring divisive political issues to the fore. Yet, they can also lead individuals from the entire political spectrum to come together and dissociate from the terrorists and their radical ideas. To identify causal effects, we exploit a series of natural experiments in Great Britain and leverage the timing of fatal far-right and Islamic terrorist attacks and the date of interview of respondents in the British Election Study. We find that Islamic attacks increase affective polarization whereas far-right attacks depolarize the electorate. We demonstrate that this discrepancy is largely driven by the salience of the attack -- and the resulting threat perceptions -- and the attitudes towards contentious and polarizing issues.	NA
2023	401	CP22	How Memorialization of Conflict Alters the Legacies of Violence	The conventional view in the literature on the legacies of violence holds that the original experience of violence has a direct effect on victims and their descendants. We problematize this view, noting that political entrepreneurs seek to alter the legacy of violence through manipulation of historical memory. To test whether the manipulation of historical memory alters the legacies of violence we study a natural experiment in the Spanish Civil War whereby the assignment of violence was orthogonal to the political characteristics of affected settlements. Leveraging the data on actual violence during the civil war, an original dataset on historical memorials, and outcome measures of political preferences and behavior from an original survey we ask whether (i) the pattern of memorialization faithfully reflects the experience of violence, and (ii) whether present-day attitudes and behavior are a legacy of the original experience of violence or of the subsequent policy of memorialization. We find that contemporary attitudes are often a product of memorialization rather than the original experience of violence. These findings suggest an important corrective in the field of legacy studies.	NA
2023	454	454	Misinformation and Anti-Minority Vigilantism: An Experiment in India and Pakistan	Vigilante violence targeting religious and sectarian minorities has become increasingly common, and popular, in India and Pakistan. Yet, beyond these (few) journalistic accounts, little is known about the drivers of these events. In this project, we ask what role, if any, misinformation plays in support for vigilantism. On the one hand, rumors could directly drive this support, especially in contexts where such information is readily believed. On the other hand, citizens could be motivated to support violence as a result of long-standing and deep societal cleavages, or due to beliefs about inept state capacity or positionality, with misinformation playing no causal role. To identify how misinformation intervenes in these events, we field an adapted conjoint-experiment in 6 districts (3 in India, 3 in Pakistan). Respondents react to a series of social media posts and professionally recorded audio newscasts describing acts of vigilantism and their follow-up. To isolate the impact of misinformation from other beliefs, we include several experimental variations in these prompts, before measuring their impact on support for vigilantism and on affective polarization.

2023	630	CP22	With a little help from my enemy – the effects of spirals of electoral violence on extremist voting	How do spirals of electoral violence shape electoral outcomes? A large body of research highlights that electoral violence serves as strategic tool of political elites trying to influence election results. In particular, violence aims at demobilizing opponents’ constituencies. We shift attention to another potential mechanism. In contexts of political polarization, elites can use violence to mobilize their own constituencies: spirals of violence, i.e. repeated attacks and counter-attacks by extremist parties on opposing ends of the political spectrum, allow candidates to portray themselves as resolute guardians against political radicals. Our analyses of the electoral effects of these spirals of violence focus on a most likely context: the final phase of the Weimar republic before Hitler’s ascension to power. We draw on archival police records on more than 3000 violent clashes in the elections years 1930, 1932 and 1933. We combine this information with county-level election results and historical census data.	NA
2023	1122	CP37	When Do Firms Engage with Social Issues? The Role of Empowered Knowledge Workers	The number of companies that speak out on politically-charged and socially divisive issues has grown significantly in most advanced democracies. While some studies have focused on the influence of investors and consumers, less have paid attention to the increasing importance of employees. Under what conditions are firms more responsive to the preferences of the workforce than to those of other stakeholders such as investors and consumers? What specific form does this response take? Exploiting the growing role of employees in the charity donation activities of firms (via “matching donation programs”, paid volunteer days, or voting for their preferred charity partner), I build a novel database of workforce preferences and priorities at the firm level the US and the UK over seven years (2015-2021). By exploring exogenous shocks to the structure of the workforce, I show that firms increase their attention to diversity and inclusion issues after employees voice their concerns around these issues through volunteering or charity behaviour. More broadly, this paper expands our understanding of how knowledge workers can exert pressure on business rhetoric and behaviour in knowledge economies.	NA
2023	1487	CP37	The Multiple Two-Dimensional Spaces of Western Electoral Politics in Voters’ Own Words	There is a broad consensus among scholars that the ideological space of Western democracies consists of two distinct dimensions: one economic and the other cultural. In this manuscript, we explore how ordinary citizens make sense of these two dimensions. Analyzing novel survey data collected across 10 Western democracies, we employ text analysis techniques to investigate responses to open-ended questions. We examine variations in how people interpret ideological dimensions along three levels of analyses: across countries, based on demographic features, and based on partisan identities. Our results suggests that there are multiple two-dimensional spaces: that is, different groups ascribe different meanings to what the economic and cultural political divides stand for. Our findings make theoretical contributions to the study of electoral politics and political ideology.	NA
2023	1821	CP37	Validating Issue-based Idealpoints of Tweets in a Party-Centered System	Ideological ideal points of legislators and candidates are central to testing numerous theories in political science. In parliamentary systems, traditional measures such as roll call votes are uninformative. Additional measures have been suggested using text analysis of political communication, such as parliamentary speeches, press statements, or social media posts. Interpreting and validating these measures is difficult though since the concept itself is latent and multi-dimensional.We suggest a model for social media, using supervised classification into crucial categories considered important by voters and politicians alike. Based on more than 2,000 annotated tweets, we trained a transformer model to predict all tweets by candidates in the 2021 German federal election. Following saliency theory, we extract fundamental dimensions of political space from issue emphasis and validate these ideal points with self-reported positions from the GLES candidate study.We find that a central left-right dimension is generally sufficient to describe differences between candidates in terms of political communication. They correlate with about .8 with self-reported positions and partly predict deviation in roll-call votes. This shows social media complements existing data for party-centered systems.	NA
2023	492	CP37	The Dynamic Emergence of New Parties through a Compositional Change in their Voters' Profiles	Party systems in Europe are more fragmented than in the past, especially with the rise of Radical Right parties. When analyzing these parties, most of the academic literature analyzes a single election or several combined. This research aims to show the dynamic emergence of new parties and how they attract different profiles of voters at different elections. Through a comparative analysis of several new parties around Europe, it shows how new parties initially attract voters with a higher educational level, while once they enter parliament and prove their viability, they start attracting voters who subjectively feel poorer. In addition, an in-depth precinct-level analysis of the emergence and spread of Vox, Podemos, and Sweden Democrats shows how these parties spread from precincts with higher incomes to those with lower incomes. These results underpin that the ‘left behind’ hypothesis takes place once new parties are in parliament, but voters with higher levels of education boost new parties before their entrance into parliament.

2023	535	CP37	All Shades of Green: Chromatic Variation and Political Alignment in European Green Parties	Political parties carefully strategize on their visual brands, starting from the design of the most fundamental piece of their identity: the logos. Party logos possess multiple features, but one most critical cue is their color. Nascent research in political science studies logo's variation of color across countries and time. Empirical studies have shown consistent chromatic patterns in left-right party families. This paper contributes to this literature on political symbols by focusing on a less investigated but politically rising group: European green parties. Conventional wisdom suggests that these parties show maximum color consistency (isomorphism). Challenging this view, we show that European green parties vary significantly in terms of color patterns and, therefore, ideology association in recent years. Using a new dataset of green parties’ logos and state-of-the-art color analysis techniques, we also show the domestic and international correlates of green parties’ logo variation. This research has important implications for the associations and divergences across green and classical left-right parties. The results also suggest under which conditions green parties are more or less likely to express their identity following the homonymous color.	NA
2023	1003	CP24	Governing in the face of a global crisis: when do voters punish and reward incumbent governments?	No democratic country has been shielded from the governance challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, governments have had to manage not only a public health crisis, but also an economic crisis precipitated by the virus. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 crisis has affected support for, or satisfaction with the performance of, incumbent governments. In this paper, we seek to understand, from a comparative perspective, how citizens evaluate the performance of governments in managing the crisis. We field a conjoint experiment in 18 countries across six continents where individuals are asked to evaluate incumbents using information on both their economic and public health-related performance. In total, our data contains responses from over 22,000 individuals, who collectively made over 177,000 choices in the experiment. Leveraging the large amount of data collected, we explore treatment effect heterogeneity using machine learning techniques.	NA
2023	106	PL25	Parties and People – When Do Parties Support Direct Democracy?	During every crisis of representative democracy, there is a surge of demands for more direct forms of participation. Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the Five Star Movement in current-day Italy -- discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actor in the formulation of these demands? We ask why political parties call and/or support direct democracy. We provide two major motivations: ideology and strategy. Analyzing party manifestos of European parties from 1946 onward, we show how ideological motivations seem to account for most variation in party positions towards direct democracy. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins as well as it helps to better understand whether direct democracy is endogenous with certain outcomes or not.	NA
2023	1630	PE17	The Strategic Use of Recall Elections: Loyalty, Competence, and Promotion	Why would an incumbent launch a recall election against herself? In this paper, I argue that ruling parties can strategically use direct-democracy mechanisms – such as recall elections – to strengthen discipline within the party. I develop a formal model to show how national party leaders can strategically use a referendum in order to learn information about the loyalty and competence of local party officials. I evaluate two implications of the model using data from Mexico’s 2022 presidential referendum recall, which was launched by sitting president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador against himself. First, I present evidence – including regression-discontinuity estimates – that suggests the results of the referendum were shaped by the mobilization efforts of mayors from the president’s party (MORENA). Second, I plan to explore whether the results of the referendum were used to reward high-performing MORENA mayors with greater opportunities for career advancement. These results have important implications for the growing literature on the use and abuse of direct democracy.	NA
2023	1640	CP24	Of Shocks, Crises and Shifts. Positional adaptation mechanisms of political parties in times of crises.	How do parties react to environments of uncertainty such as international crises caused by external shocks? Contemporary literature emphasizes that political parties do not respond uniformly to a changing environment. This article argues that positional adaptation mechanisms in response to an external shock follow distinct rules, due to the focusing character of crises. I propose that electoral success and previous positional shifts within the topical dimension of the external shock influence consecutive adaptations. To test these arguments, I draw upon the global financial crisis and the European refugee crisis, as recent examples. Utilizing manually coded party manifestos of nine countries across central and north-western Europe based on the Comparative Manifesto Project and the Comparative Agendas Project, I identify the underlying topical textual data. Afterwards I apply unsupervised scaling methods to generate individual party positions on these issues. Last, I analyze the impact of these crises on consecutive positional adaptions using regression models. The results hold implications for existing and future research of comparative politics and international crises, especially in light of more events across Europe.	NA
2023	566	CP24	Ain't my crime! How dictators shift blame for economic crises.	Major economic crises pose a substantial threat to any dictator. By undermining popular support for the regime and limiting incumbents’ capacity to buy support, economic crises frequently contribute to the breakdown of authoritarian regimes. Yet, many dictators have survived even prolonged economic downturns. To sustain their rule in times of economic crises, they employ a variety of strategies to avoid being blamed for the crisis and to shore up domestic support. Currently, little is known about their effectiveness in sustaining authoritarian rule.We investigate the effects of three frequent strategies: 1) Scapegoating and firing subordinates, 2) blaming external enemies, 3) referring to Force Majeure.Using the case of Turkey – an electoral autocracy where President Erdogan has survived years of economic crisis - we combine a well-powered survey experiment (N = 4000) and in-depth interviews with focus groups to test how the three strategies affect citizens' views on the economy, as well as support and mobilization for the incumbent and the opposition.The survey experiment will be fielded February 2023 and the focus groups conducted shortly after.

2023	1447	CP27	The Partisan Consequences of High-Salience Government Borrowing	What have been the partisan consequences of the return of fiscal policy to the centre of political contestation? We present new theory and evidence pointing to a systematic electoral disadvantage for left parties in times (and places) where public borrowing is more salient. Importantly, this is not only because left parties are less willing to reduce borrowing, but also because of asymmetric features in the way that voters perceive the links between taxes, spending, and borrowing. Survey and experimental evidence from the UK indicate that voters link the problem of borrowing to the expenditure side of the budget than the revenue side, with spending cuts more readily seen as the solution to the problem of a deficit. Left parties' association with spending hurts them; right parties' association with tax cuts does not. Finally, right parties press home this advantage. We present evidence from the UK, Germany and USA that right parties seek to mobilise the issue of borrowing, as well as riding the favourable currents of high-borrowing periods.	NA
2023	1527	CP27	Democracy, Morality and Innovation	When do citizens tolerate the emergence of new technologies with economic transition costs? Using comprehensive comparative survey data, text data, and experiments, our study explores the conditions under which democracy provides and prevents innovations from emerging. We focus on the role of moral economic norms in democracies and the inherent moral character of technology protectionism in pluralistic societies. In our study, we use a subjective risk assessments and cross-country survey experiments to measure citizens' preferences for curtailing certain aspects of emerging technologies, such as sharing data or acceptance of risks relating to AI. Our results suggest that citizens often prefer to curtail aspects of technology in line with predominant social norms, while still promoting the acquisition of new skills and participation in growth generated by these technologies. We discuss the implications of heterogeneous but compressed preferences for technology protectionism on the ability of advanced democracies to match the requirements of modern market economies.	NA
2023	1772	CP27	Pre-distribution, Redistribution and Social Investment in OECD Countries: Trade-Offs and Complementarities between Equality-Enhancing Policies	Extant literature has argued that pre-distribution, redistribution and social investment are important equality-enhancing policies. Yet, we know little about the links between those egalitarian strategies. Are they complementary, or are there political or budgetary trade-offs or trilemmas that undermine parallel commitment to pre-distribution, redistribution, and social investment? After a brief survey of the evidence that the scrutinized policies are indeed equality enhancing, we map existing research in favor of negative and positive sum relationships (trade-offs and complementarities) theoretically and empirically. After this overview, we leverage a new dataset on pre-distribution, redistribution, and social investment policy to tackle this question: First, we show the trajectories of 16 OECD countries on these three dimensions, then we take stock of linkages, lags and scope conditions, and the temporal changes in these linkages. We find very little evidence that zero-sums from con-joint survey experiments translate into observed within-country policy trade-offs, and between countries complementarities still dominate. Our findings call into question assessments that look at the three dimensions in isolation and argue in favor of a more policy-centered perspective on the pathways to equality.	NA
2023	1779	CP27	Anti-Americanism and Attitudes toward Foreign Aid	International aid is a critical component of local development. However, among local officials, not all foreign aid donors are created equal. In particular, in many Middle Eastern countries, anti-American sentiments are widespread, and many citizens express disdain or skepticism of U.S. aid organizations. Less is understood about how local officials view domestic versus foreign aid partners. While international partners may bring more funding and publicity to a foreign aid project, local officials may also have a preference for not working with international aid partners and, in particular U.S. aid organizations. Using a survey of 1900 local political candidates, we find that local officials prefer local development projects that have funding from domestic sources and are especially reticent to pursue local development projects with funding from USAID. This research extends existing research on anti-Americanism and foreign aid in the MENA region by demonstrating the effect among the political class.	NA
2023	603	CP27	Globalisation and political stability	Trading national policy autonomy for expected economic benefits, most countries in Western Europe have become economically interdependent, but the political consequences of these decisions are still unclear. This paper examines how reduced levels of government policy autonomy affect political behaviour. We argue that voters only become aware of the limited electoral accountability of their governments when highly economically integrated countries are asymmetrically hit by severe economic shocks. We expect electoral behaviour to be generally stable, and electoral volatility to increase only when reduced policy autonomy becomes evident to voters. Using the exposure of Western democracies to economic shocks and diverging levels of economic interdependence between 1957 and 2020, we first examine at the macro level how electoral volatility between establishment and non-establishment parties is affected by varying levels of economic and political integration in the event of an economic shock. At the micro-level, we then use survey data from the two rotating modules on democracy included in the European Social Survey 2012 and 2020 to understand if shifts in electoral volatility are actually due to voters lacking policy choices.

2023	1685	CP28	King-makers or Caretakers? Investigating the Nature and Significance of Interim Regimes	Interim regimes, or transitional governments as they are also called, often play an important role in the outcome of democratization processes. When established after, e.g., the overthrow of a long-ruling autocrat, they can play pivotal roles in a polity’s political development, potentially working as a critical juncture that determines whether a country again consolidates autocratic rule under a different ruling coalition or takes substantial steps towards democracy. Despite their importance, research on interim regimes is fragmented, and in quantitative research almost absent. One reason for this is the lack of useful data on interim regimes. In this paper, we take steps to remedy this by classifying and mapping all transitional regimes since 1789 and their key characteristics, identifying 215 interim regimes across modern political history. Importantly, our data reveals that these transitional governments are followed by a democratic regime in only half of the cases. And, in almost 40% of the cases, an interim regime is established after a coup deposes a democratic regime with an aim to install a new democratic regime.	NA
2023	485	CP28	Similar or Different? Drivers of Incumbent- versus External Takeovers, 1789-2020	When democracies break down, the culpable actors come either from outside (typically military officers) or inside (typically elected presidents) the elite circles of the former democratic regime. We discuss how the incentives of different actors to subvert democracy may be influenced asymmetrically by different factors, but also discuss how strategic interaction between different actors (e.g., military officers making a pre-emptive coup to mitigate the chances of a chief executive self-coup) may affect how socio-economic and institutional factors relate to various types of democratic breakdown. In this paper, we provide the, so far, most comprehensive study on the drivers of different types of democratic breakdown. We first present a multidimensional categorization of democratic breakdown processes, before discussing theoretical expectations on two key sets of determinants, namely shocks that should alleviate collective action problems for coup plotters as well as institutional constraints on incumbents. We find that economic crisis is clearly related to higher risk of non-incumbent takeover, but not to incumbent-driven breakdown of democracy. In contrast, we find that various types of institutional constraints are related to both types of breakdown.	NA
2023	785	CP28	Party System Polarization, Party System Fragmentation and Democratic Breakdown in Interwar Europe	How do fragmentation and polarization affect democratic deconsolidation and breakdown? While increasing levels of fragmentation and polarization are richly documented in Western democracies, few, if any, democracies have failed. We turn to the European interwar period (1919-1939) to investigate the interplay between political polarization and fragmentation of party systems as an explanation of democratic deconsolidation. We introduce novel data on party systems in 25 European democracies and 130 democratic elections during the interwar period and propose a multi-dimensional measurement of polarization that is not a function of fragmentation. We show that it is systems with few parties and high polarization, as well as systems with many parties and low polarization that are among the least stable. Thus, the consequences of fragmentation and polarization for democratic stability can only be understood when studied in interaction. This point towards two types of dis-functioning party systems: one in which neither of only two parties addresses the median voter, and one in which too many parties compete over the same set of voters.

2023	917	CP28	Why New Mayors Survive?	This study explores the factors that contribute to the reelection of a first-term mayor. The literature has revealed findings on the conditions for incumbency advantage in elected officials. However, the connection between the mayors' policy choices and their reelection is largely unaddressed. Mayors’ policy choices in their first terms could potentially be critical for their reelection because far-reaching changes in existing policies could lead to dissatisfaction among local politicians and electorates and invite strong challengers in the next election. This study analyses all mayoral elections in Japan from 1999 to 2018. There are three types of first-term mayors, successors named by the previous mayor, winners of races without incumbents, and challengers who have beaten the incumbents. We claim that each type has different policy expectations held by local politicians and electorates and betraying them could cost their reelection. We investigate how each type of mayor would gain or suffer from the policy change measured from the shift in the composition of fiscal expenditures.	NA
2023	1205	CP36	Polarisation and counter-stereotypical information	We track affective and meta-polarisation in Brazil in three survey rounds in 2022. By presenting true but surprising information about the policy opinions of political in-groups and out-groups (Lulistas and Bolsonaristas) from a previous survey round, we test whether respondents' own opinions alter, and whether affective and meta-polarisation can be reduced. We also explore the the effect of our treatment on anti-democratic attitudes. Finally, we provide descriptive information about citizens' perceptions of the intensity of feelings between those with different political opinions, and their perceptions of what activities in everyday life heighten or placate this intensity. This work has been pre-registered.	NA
2023	1570	CP36	Does Economic Inequality Harm Democratic Quality? No, but Yes	According to a widely held view, economic inequality undermines democracy. While the link between inequality and regime change has been studied extensively, the relationship between economic inequality and the degree of democraticness in countries with free, inclusive elections is underexplored. Inspired by Dahl, we distinguish between democratic quality understood as the fulfilment of procedural-institutional features on the one hand and as substantive political equality on the other hand. We expect that while economic inequality might not undermine democracy understood in a procedural-institutional fashion, the stronger principle of political inequality is more likely to be affected by economic disparities. To examine these predictions, we analyze time-series cross-section data spanning the period 1960-2020 using two-way fixed effects estimators. Our results indicate that economic inequality, measured as income inequality, is not a robust predictor of democratic quality understood as the fulfilment of procedural-institutional criteria associated with polyarchy and liberal democracy. However, income inequality is a robust predictor of two different proxies of political inequality. Whether economic inequality harms democratic quality thus depends on how demanding our concept of democracy is.	NA
2023	1639	CP36	Satisfaction with democracy after winning and losing without elections	Citizens who support a party included in the government are systematically more satisfied with democracy compared to supporters of an opposition party. However, does this winner-loser gap materialize also in the absence of an election? We make use of the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 data collection in Estonia (2016/2017) which was unexpectedly split by a switch of the largest party included in the three-party coalition more than 20 months after the parliamentary elections. Via a difference-in-differences design, we examine the effect of this status change on citizens’ satisfaction with democracy. The preliminary results suggest that voters’ attitudes confirm that becoming a winner boosts people’s satisfaction with democracy. However, the fact that the magnitude of the effect is rather small raises the question whether the role of winner-loser status on one’s democratic satisfaction is not overstated once we use a better estimation strategy.

2023	1909	CP09	Social norms and support for democracy: Experimental evidence from Norway	Modern democracy seemingly enjoys widespread support from citizens across the globe. Yet, history and contemporary events reveal that declared support for democracy not always translates into pro-democratic behavior. We argue that declared support for democracy is partly shaped by social norms and expectations about the attitudes of others. Such norm-driven support for democracy may stabilize democracy when mass endorsement of democracy is high. But it also renders support for democracy vulnerable to potential (rapid) decay if citizens (suddenly) realize that others are not deeply committed to pro-democratic norms. We draw on evidence from Norway -- widely considered one of the world's most robust democracies -- to study how and to what extent democratic support is driven by social influence. We combine data from surveys, controlled lab settings and a field experiment to both elicit the strength of democratic commitment and their malleability to social cues and pressures. The paper yields insights into how pro-democracy behavior is shaped and therefore also potentially altered and undermined.	NA
2023	1987	CP36	Is Royalty Good for Democracy? Constitutional Monarchy and Its Contributions to Satisfaction with Democracy	In democratic parliamentary monarchies, the royal family is sometimes perceived as a relic of the past. What is a constitutional monarch good for? The literature on monarchy and regimes has yet to provide an answer. In this paper, we argue that these monarchs’ apolitical nature unifies their subjects and encourages cooperation, trust, and consensus among citizens and elites. As such, citizens of democratic parliamentary monarchies are on average more satisfied with democracy than those of republics. To test our argument, we utilize the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Surveys and the European Social Surveys (ESS) to measure citizens’ political attitudes and opinions on democracy, and the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys and the MARPOR datasets to measure parties’ ideological positions. We also conduct a survey experiment to test our theory’s causal mechanism. Both sets of results support our hypotheses: democratic parliamentary monarchs reduce citizens’ perceived ideological distances with parties; this, in turn, raises citizens’ satisfaction with democracy. These results suggest that perhaps counterintuitively, constitutional monarchies can safeguard countries against deterioration of democratic legitimacy.	NA
2023	1745	CP40	Pre-electoral polls and aggregate uncertainty in the field	This paper examines how the presence of pre-electoral polls, a source of common-knowledge information about the distribution of voters' preferences, affects the predictions of Duverger's Law. Exploiting the time-varying and rotating nature of municipality-specific pre-electoral polls for local elections in Spain, I find that pre-electoral polls significantly increase the vote share concentration for the top two candidates as well as the gap with the third most voted candidate. The results are consistent with models and lab experiments featuring aggregate uncertainty, which favors the emergence of non-Duverger's law equilibria in plurality elections. Moreover, they outline the relevance of pre-electoral polls as a policy tool to facilitate voters' coordination.	NA
2023	1906	CP40	Pre-electoral Coalition Strategies in Multiparty Systems	Government coalitions are a foreseeable and central feature of governance in multiparty systems. This fact often compels parties to make coalition politics part of their pre-election campaign effort, signaling their preferred coalition to the electorate. In this article, we derive theoretical expectations that take voters' reactions to pre-electoral coalitions into account under what conditions pre-electoral coalitions form and which parties form such coalitions. The model reveals that the ideological configuration of the coalition matters: Parties favor joining pre-electoral coalitions with partners that are found on the same side of the ideological spectrum. Bringing together data about pre-electoral coalitions in 398 legislative elections from 22 advanced industrialized democratic countries from 1946 to 2014 permits us to support this hypothesis. The finding that parties are more likely to enter bloc pre-electoral coalitions has important implications for accountability and representation in proportional systems	NA
2023	400	CP40	The Electoral Consequences of Government-initiated Votes of Confidence	Scholars have long been interested in how the strategic use of constitutional tools in parliamentary democracies impacts the electorate. Notably, we know that PMs with unilateral assembly dissolution powers tend to schedule elections timed to their advantage. We also know that the opposition’s vote share is boosted by the employment of no-confidence motions, even though these are usually struck down. Yet, we know little about the electoral implications of -arguably- one of the most powerful instruments afforded to parliamentary administrations: the vote of confidence procedure. Governments formally engage responsibility for different purposes, from reversing legislative defeats to prioritizing and molding cabinet proposals. Occasionally, the procedure has been invoked for extremely salient and controversial issues. In this article, I investigate voters’ reactions to the calling and the outcome of votes of confidence initiated by the executive. I exploit a novel dataset covering over 400 instances of application of this tool across 14 countries (1945-2021). I look at whether and how confidence motions sway electors’ evaluations of the incumbent. To address potential endogeneity concerns, I rely on a selection model.	NA
2023	683	CP40	Winners Rule: Coalition Building and the Preference for Partners with an Increased Vote Share	In a two-party majoritarian system, it is mechanically trivial to expect the winner of an election to form the next government. In countries with multi-party proportional electoral systems -- the majority of democracies -- the mapping from electoral gains to government inclusion is less clear. For this reason, scholars have often held that election results matter more for who governs in majoritarian systems. We show here that this distinction is not as large as previously thought, namely that parties that lose vote share in multi-party systems are less likely to be included in coalition governments. Although the mechanical determinant is missing in proportional multi-party systems, accountability for election results is still very much reflected in government composition.	NA
2023	960	CP40	Asset or liability? Intra-party heterogeneity, government formation, and the allocation of ministerial portfolios	In European multiparty systems, coalition government is the rule and parties need to agree how to allocate the spoils of office during government formation. Portfolio allocation is a well-studied aspect of coalition negotiations and existing research indicates that both institutional and party level factors are important to understand the question of “who gets what”. We add to this literature by exploring the impact of a hitherto understudied aspect that is an important characteristic of political parties: intra-party heterogeneity. Interestingly, prevalent theories of inter-party bargaining come to different conclusions about the impact of heterogeneity on bargaining power during coalition negotiations. To some, positional diversity within parties allows party representatives to credibly threaten to withdraw from the bargaining table if the interests of their factions are not taken into account. To others, presenting a unified position is an invaluable asset to achieve one’s goals during negotiations. We test these conflicting propositions using newly acquired data on intra-party heterogeneity and portfolio allocation in several European parliamentary democracies. Our results have wider implications for party competition, government formation and political representation.	NA
2023	1030	CP39	The Dictator's Legionnaires: Foreign Troops, Personalism, and Coups	Scholars are now paying growing attention to the determinants and consequences of different forms of organization and composition of security forces in dictatorships. Such dimensions include the degree of organizational fragmentation, professionalization, the existence of ties to the regime or to society, the ethnic background of officers and personnel, and overall fighting capacity. One important dimensions that remains unexplored is the recruitment and presence of foreign troops. Such practices have been becoming more usual in the last few decades despite the fact that international wars have become scarce. We argue that there is also a domestic and strategic component to such recruitment practices. The presence of foreign nationals within a country's armed forces shapes to a large extent the ties between the armed forces and society at large. We show that higher levels of personalism are related to a higher likelihood of recruiting foreign nations into the armed forces. Further, we also argue that the presence of foreign troops reduces the risk of coups.	NA
2023	1346	CP39	Unpacking Disloyalty: Dissent Strategies and Subversive Actions Among Security Forces	Do non-violent strategies lead to loyalty shifts amongst security forces? Research suggests that non-violent dissent campaigns outperform violent campaigns in fostering transitions from dictatorship to democracy, largely because non-violence induces security force defection. We move up the conceptual ladder of abstraction and shift attention from defection to disloyalty, identifying seven types of disloyal or subversive actions: (1) stop supporting the regime, (2) quit the security apparatus, (3) join the opposition movement, (4) voice support for the opposition or voice criticism to the regime, (5) idling (or shirking), (6) barracking and/or, (7) coup d'etat. We theorize that violent and non-violent strategies are linked to different disloyal actions, and derive propositions about the effect of dissent strategies on specific disloyal actions. We find that specific types of disloyal actions are related to different campaign strategies: security forces are more likely to be idling, voicing loyalty to the campaign or quit supporting the regime during non-violent campaigns, while members of the security forces quitting the security apparatus and joining the campaign are more common during violent campaigns.

2023	1428	CP09	The Dark Side of Mobilisation: Global Evidence on Authoritarian Protests	Mass mobilisation is usually considered a force for democracy and political liberalisation. Yet, many mass movements have explicit authoritarian or anti-liberal claims. When and why do such authoritarian mass mobilisation movements emerge, and who are the citizens that participate? While existing literature focuses on the determinants and outcomes of pro-democracy movements, we know much less about the nature and drivers of this 'dark side of mobilization''. Our project collects new, global data on 200 years of pro-authoritarian mass mobilization and in this paper we offer a first comprehensive mapping of the nature of these movements. We highlight the need for a more systematic understanding of the occurrence and features of pro-authoritarian protests and situate the phenomenon within a broader literature on the rise of pro-authoritarian popular sentiments. We introduce our data collection effort, and describe preliminary evidence from Europe over the past 200 years. Revisiting existing findings about the drivers of mass protest, our suggestive evidence indicates that the factors triggering pro-democracy movements are not necessarily the same as those factors triggering pro-authoritarian protest.

2023	1569	CP39	“The Weight of Too Much Liberty”: A Predictive Spatio-temporal Model of Police Response to Partisanship in England	In liberal democracies, the expectation is that basic democratic rights - freedom of expression and of association and peaceful assembly - will be passively observed, if not actively defended, by law enforcement. Anecdotal evidence from England, however, suggests certain groups, all ‘Leftist’, are increasingly unable to exercise these rights for fear of police reprisal. Due to recent reports, this paper empirically investigates how partisanship impacts police response. We primarily rely on the ACLED’s observational protest data, which already includes spatial and temporal measures. Using machine learning, observations are supplemented with a binary and a categorical measure denoting police response and severity, respectively. Protestor partisanship is manually assigned using expert surveys and the analysis of group manifestos and political communications. As police response is an inconsistent variable, this paper leans on non-parametric Bayesian estimation methods to fill gaps created by limited or missing data. Through Spatio-temporal Gaussian Process Regression, county-level models of predicted response are rendered. In short, this paper demonstrates the space-specific likelihood that the Left will be over-policed and, by that corollary, that the Right will be under-policed over time.	NA
2023	287	CP39	Policing Protests: Theory and Evidence from Paris and London	This paper develops a game-theoretic model of confrontations between the police and political protesters. It then illustrates the implications of the model with the help of a series of case studies of political events in two great cities, London and Paris, from the nineteenth century until the present. The paper emphasizes two explanatory factors, political inclusiveness and the capacity of the police, which jointly determine how the police respond to political protests and unrest. The argument explains when the police is most likely to manage, repress, or ignore political protests.	NA
2023	1262	CP38	Fighting Collective Threats: Socialist Revolutions and the Covid-19 Pandemic	The Covid-19 pandemic has raised questions about the capacity of modern states to deal with non-armed challenges. The discussion has centred around how different types of political regimes have been able to cope with a huge public health problem, also highlighting the erosive effects of neoliberal policies on the provision of public services in advanced democracies. Nobody so far has put the focus on the role of socialism and, beyond the hunt for contemporary explanations, on the existence of long-term regime-driven legacies that may have had an impact on the containment of Covid-related deaths. What I claim in this paper is that countries that went through successful socialist revolutions have specific features that equip them with better resources to cope with public challenges such as pandemics. I also claim that these features remain even after the demise of the socialist regime. I find a positive effect of socialist revolutions over Covid-19 containment. This effect seems to be channeled through institutions with stronger capabilities, and in societies with a larger preference for collective values over individual freedom.	NA
2023	1682	CP38	Forests, Conservation and Conflict: Evidence from 19th century France.	What are the consequences of historical state intervention in environmental conservation? Deforestation was a major issue in early 19th century France, and politicians viewed the excess use of communal land as its main cause. In 1827, the state passed a Forest code which limited longstanding use rights on most forests. The law led to major revolts in several forested regions of France, where peasants relied on these rights to complement their income. Using detailed data on forest geography and the gradual application of the Forest code, I show the impact of state intervention in forest conservation on local development, compliance with the law and revolts against state authority.

2023	1924	1924	The Hardest Terrain? The Effects of the Urban Terrain on Government Violence during Civil War	Physical infrastructure is commonly used as a proxy for state reach and capacity. Cities tend to be strongholds of the state and to have dense built-up infrastructures. Military practitioners, however, suggest that, during civil conflict, the urban infrastructure might weaken state's abilities to punish rebellions because they add logistical constraints for governments. For instance, conventional artillery is hard to use. Mobility might be more difficult in small roads and lines of sight to re are diminished due to the presence of buildings. Despite the extensive availability of data to measure the built-up infrastructure of cities, there has been scant research on how this affects government violence. With ne-grained data of more than 140 000 victims from the Syrian conflict, I investigate whether and how the urban topography affects the levels of government violence.	NA
2023	711	CP38	When Authoritarian Elites Play the Sycophant Card: Explaining Variation in Russian Governors’ Public Expression of Loyalty to Putin	All elites in autocracies try to show loyalty to the autocrat to avoid punishment. However, not all behave as outright sycophants, and not all ‘yes-men’ pander to the ruler to the same degree. Why not? Building on social psychological research on ingratiation strategies and studies on personality cults, we argue that: i) ‘playing the sycophant’s card’ is a strategy that mainly weaker elites, more dependent on the autocrat, resort to; and ii) weaker elites that use this strategy are rewarded for their public subordination. To test these hypotheses, we employ a novel empirical approach for measuring elite loyalty in autocracies. Using text-as-data methods, we analyze original data on almost 1000 annual addresses of Russian governors to regional parliaments from 2007 to 2021. We find that governors up for election/reappointment and those more dependent on transfers from the center are indeed more likely to praise President Putin in their speeches and also tend to emphasize the same kind of topics and words as him. We also show that Putin’s ‘yes-men’ survive longer in office and receive more perks.	NA
2023	10	CP23	Representing voters during crisis: Party-voter congruence during the COVID-19 pandemic	Party-voter congruence is an essential aspect of contemporary representative democracies. It entails a certain degree of ideological correspondence between the general public and the political elites in terms of positioning and policy preferences. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic implied urgent and effective political responses to face the crisis with emerging new debates on how to handle the crisis and what to prioritize. These trade-offs such as health vs. the economy forced political parties to adopt an ideological stance while voters formed a solid opinion on the matter. By relying on Chapel Hill Expert Survey and European Social Survey Round 10 data, the paper investigates the level of congruence between parties and voters on how to handle the pandemic in different European countries. Mainstream and vote-maximisation-orientated parties were more likely to be congruent with the population, whereas niche and policy-orientated parties were more congruent with their constituencies. Ideology and the role of the party in parliament also played an important role in moderating the level of congruence. The findings are relevant to the debates on the functioning of democratic representation.	NA
2023	1010	CP23	Federalism in Crisis? How the Diffusion of Executive Power Affects Crisis Management and Party Dynamics	As a crisis requiring swift political reactions, Covid-19 has uncovered dynamics of multi-level governance that are hidden in normal times. While most studies analysing party dynamics in the context of Covid-19 focused on the national level, few studies investigated multi-level party dynamics. Thus, this article analyses under which conditions regional party associations deviate from their federal party’s position on Covid-19. Making use of the German federal system, we contend that deviations from the federal party can be explained by sub-national differences in political configurations and in the intensity of the crisis. We compiled a new dataset of more than 65,000 press releases issued by all parties and executives that are represented in German state parliaments and the Bundestag between January 2020 and May 2022. To test our theoretical propositions, we rely on semi-supervised text models that enable us to trace the policy positions of sub-national and federal parties and executives. With this study, we contribute to the understanding of the interplay of political actors in multi-level governance and shed light on intra-party dynamics between the sub-national and federal level.

2023	1452	CP23	And when it all blows up? Corruption Victimization and the Electoral Effects of the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion	When do voters punish incumbents for corruption? The literature suggests that while citizens generally dislike corruption, this distaste often does not translate into changes in electoral behaviour – specifically so in low and middle income countries. Common explanations hold that corruption may never be salient enough to foster changes at the ballot boxes, or that long standing loyalties and clientelistic ties override citizens' aversion to malfeasance. What, however, if corruption 'blows up in people's faces'? This paper investigates the electoral effects of the 2020 'Beirut Blast', when 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate ripped a whole in Lebanon's capital, killed hundreds, maimed thousands, and destroyed the homes of a quarter of a million citizens. Building on (1) the observations that the event was widely perceived as a result of corruption, (2) the assessment that the location of Beirut's port is exogenous to vote choice and relevant correlates, and (3) the laws of thermodynamics, I use euclidian distance to the explosion as a proxy for corruption victimization, and measure its impact on new entrant voteshares in the 2022 Lebanese general elections.

2023	851	851	Public Support for Global Vaccine Distribution: Evidence from Germany, Italy, and the US	A global shortage of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic raised difficult questions about how vaccines should be distributed. COVAX was established as an institution to oversee the equitable distribution of vaccines, but it failed to follow through on its mission because wealthy countries with vaccines prioritized their own domestic political considerations. Without more equitable distribution, SARS-CoV-2 continued to mutate in countries with low vaccination rates, prolonging the pandemic. Because domestic political pressures limited the willingness of political leaders to share vaccines globally, this study experimentally tests two strategies for increasing popular support for giving vaccines to foreign countries. First, it assesses whether public opinion becomes more supportive of sharing vaccines following cues from fairness and equity concerns in vaccine distribution. Second, it assesses whether public opinion becomes more supportive when equitable vaccine distribution is framed as a matter of self-interest for wealthy countries. This study finds that the self-interest frame is better suited to improving support for vaccine sharing. In some cases, the fairness frame prompts backlash against sharing instead.	NA
2023	957	CP23	Crisis Policymaking: Did “Scientists” and Doctors Lock Down More Quickly During the COVID-19 Pandemic?	Do policymakers with relevant expertise act more quickly in crisis situations? We examine this question in the context of government responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, where commentators suggested a link between policymakers having a “science” or medical background and the speed of lockdown decisions. We examine possible underlying mechanisms and test this relationship empirically with a global dataset of the educational background of up to 188 political leaders and 181 health ministers in office at the start of the pandemic. Our empirical setup does not suffer from two prominent threats to valid inference, namely reciprocal causation and sample selection bias. Using several statistical tests, we find little support for a systematic relationship between policymakers who studied a natural science or medicine and the timing of the first lockdown or an otherwise “stringent” policy response. However, our results suggest that populist leaders and dictators dampen the effect of medical expertise in the health portfolio on the speed of lockdown. These results elucidate the political conditions under which leaders may suppress expertise relevant to a crisis.	NA
2023	1584	CP29	MPs and the rural-urban debate. How the national legislature handles regionalist parties	Existing research offers evidence about the phenomenon of geographic representation and legislators' incentives to attach greater weight to geographic representation and engage in localism behaviour. The aim of this study is twofold. First, it analyses if the urban-rural cleavage has increased in the parliamentary and public debate. Second, it explores how the entry of new rural parties may influence the discourse of state-wide parties. We expect regionalist parties have representation in the national legislature after a period of low regional references. We use data from legislatures and apply a dictionary-supervised text analysis to Spanish-written parliamentary questions to predict MPs mentions in rural/urban topics. By focusing on Spain's legislature terms, we can compare MPs' references to the diverse geographical areas when there are rural and periphery representatives or not in the national legislature in the parliament (2011-2022). We differentiate regionalist and periphery parties and regional MPs from state-wide parties because of the different party targets. This longitudinal analysis holds relevant implications in the periphery and rural-urban studies and the MPs' political behaviour in multilevel countries using quantitative text analysis.	NA
2023	1727	CP29	Holding Together? The Long-Run Evolution of Ideological Spatial Sorting in Spain	Social divisions are growing, with ideologically opposed citizens exhibiting homophily in a range of seemingly nonpolitical domains. In fact, it has been widely claimed, and recently increasingly studied, that this ideological social divide extends to individuals’ decisions about where to live. While most of the evidence so far focuses on the American case, in other countries, reports of growing geographic political polarization raise the issue of the ways in which spatial sorting might occur under different institutional frameworks. In this paper, we document the long-run evolution of geographic sorting along ideological lines in Spain, a decentralized multiparty democracy with salient territorial tensions. We provide evidence that spatial cleavages have increased dramatically since the beginning of the new century. At no point since the Great Recession have citizens been as clustered within the boundaries of individual regions as today. Nonetheless, even when geographic sorting is measured at the municipal level within these regions, differences across communities tend to follow a similar segregation logic.	NA
2023	1815	CP29	Buen Camino! The Electoral Consequences of Modern Pilgrimage	According to Allport´s (1954) intergroup contact theory, positive effects can arise from social interaction when different conditions are met. Nowadays, urban cities are exposed to daily fluent intergroup contact between its citizens, while rural areas remain more stagnant, being contact between people with homogeneous backgrounds the most frequent social interaction. Does the increase in intergroup social contact increase the support of economic integration policies in rural areas? We take advantage of the Camino de Santiago modern pilgrimage. By exploiting the recognition of new routes as part of the official itinerary, I compare turnout and voting behavior in the EU parliamentary elections between those rural areas which obtained the official pilgrimage credential to those border areas in which the status remained unchanged. The former experienced an increase in both national and international pilgrim flows compared to their counterparts. By developing a Difference-in-Difference, I show that those places in which intergroup contact experienced a boost, turnout in EU parliamentary elections increased, suggesting a change in European integration preferences.

2023	1969	CP29	Changing lifestyles, changing the vote?	Does residential mobility transform electoral behavior? The new urban neighborhoods of large European cities represent a major change in the socialization of citizens towards an individualistic pattern and a break with their previous lifestyle. These new forms of socialization and relationship with the environment can lead to a transformative change that is reflected in new political attitudes and the voting behavior. However, there are reduced previous work on this topic. To fill this gap, I geolocate the intra-municipal quasi-random residential mobility of the last decades in Spain, to estimate the impact of residential mobility on voting behavior and know whether residential mobility is the mechanism underlying the new forms of voting.

2023	1146	CP30	Communicative Representation in Cross-National Perspective	How can we evaluate political inequality and representation if voter preferences, priorities and beliefs are partly shaped by elite political communication? Earlier research, using data from the United Kingdom, has suggested that, even under these circumstances, the degree of communicative representation in a political system – i.e. how much, across issues, speech by elite actors reflects and responds to voter opinion – may be informative regarding one key aspect of political inequality within that system. We improve on this analysis in two respects. First, we expand the geographical and substantive coverage of analysis on this topic by exploring levels of communicative representation in eight European parliamentary democracies on eight issues in the 2010s. Second, we incorporate word embedding techniques to improve on prior estimates of the distribution of elite speech on these issues. Further, we discuss correlates of variation in communicative representation across these eight systems.	NA
2023	1953	CP30	Is the Future Female? A Conjoint Experiment on Arab Preferences in Six Arab Countries	To what extent do youth, who make up two-thirds of the population in majority Arab countries, view gender as determining candidate quality? Conventional wisdom holds that Arab citizens prefer male candidates, but also that youth hold different attitudes toward older generations. Using a conjoint experiment fielded to over 30,000 youth in six Arab countries, it explores youth's attitudes toward women in leadership positions. We find that youth are more likely to say that they would support female than male candidates. Moreover, they believe that female candidates are more capable across activities, including those stereotypically considered to be under men's purview - such as ensuring security and raising funds for the locality. Responses to candidate gender vary across demographic groups, with males and more religious citizens, both male and female, more likely to prefer male candidates. The study extends existing literature on youth and gender by exploring how youth see female candidates and being the first, to our knowledge, to show a preference for female candidates among some constituencies in MENA countries.

2023	202	CP30	Do Electoral Quotas Worsen Representation? Evaluating Political Selection under Institutional Constraints in India	To remedy historical inequalities in political representation, over 100 countries across the world have implemented electoral quotas for underrepresented groups. A substantial literature has demonstrated the positive impacts of these institutions on the representation of targeted minorities. While important, these studies mostly fail to grapple with the fact that people simultaneously hold multiple identities. The latter raises the possibility that quota-driven improvements in people’s representation on one dimension might come at the cost of representation on another dimension. How do quotas change the nature of political selection? Do political quotas worsen representation on some dimensions even as they improve representation on others? Under what conditions, and why or why not? We examine the effects of quotas on political selection in one state of India, where quotas are randomly assigned to villages and where we have unique, population-level, census data. Matching politician and population data, we examine (1) who runs for and wins local or village-level political office, (2) what are the effects of electoral quotas on political selection, and (3) how these patterns of political selection vary spatially.

2023	225	CP30	Paths to power: A new dataset on the social profile of governments	We introduce a new dataset on the educational, occupational, and social background of cabinet ministers across the world. We expand the recent WhoGov dataset by adding this information on more than 30,000 cabinet ministers from 123 countries in the period 1966-2021 (data-gathering is still ongoing). The dataset presented in this article is, by far, the most extensive and detailed of its kind, and it opens up for studying a number of key questions in the social sciences. Examples are questions pertaining to the role of class, education, and geography in political representation, the individual-level determinants of career paths, and how educational and occupational expertise shape policy. In this paper, we present the contents of the dataset, detail the coding rules and data gathering process, and discuss reliability and validity properties. We also show how the dataset can be used to gain new insights through, first, descriptive analysis and, second, by replicating and extending one existing study on (regime type and) the education of leaders by also including cabinet ministers.

2023	1312	CP31	Ethnic Voting and Ethnic Parties as Co-Constitutive Phenomena in Sub-Sahara Africa	While ethnicity is recognized as an important political cleavage in Sub-Saharan Africa, the nature and extent of electoral competition along ethnic lines is contested. We argue that previous studies usually do not consider ethnic voting and ethnic parties as co-constitutive phenomena. This complicates models of individual vote choice which take parties as exogenously given. We shed new light on ethnic voting and party systems by modeling both as the partitioning of a network of voters into parties. Our methodological approach estimates the effect of ethnicity on voters partitioning while controlling for confounders. Based on Afrobarometer surveys, initial results show strong and robust effects of co-ethnicity between two voters on the probability of them choosing the same party and thus the endogenous emergence of ethnically aligned parties, conditional on individual and geographic covariates. We explore the mechanisms by which ethnicity increases co-ethnic vote choice and alternative, non-ethnic explanations of place, economic interests, and historical contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential of our approach to narrow the gap between the study of micro-level voting and macro-level party systems more broadly.	NA
2023	1347	CP31	The impact of party bans on the predicament of ethnic groups: an application to Sub-Saharan Africa	The introduction of multiparty elections in new democracies has been often accompanied with the politicization of ethnic cleavages. Consequently, ethnic parties have been assumed as naturally bad for democracy, polarizing party systems and promoting communal conflicts. Therefore, many constitutions of young democracies contain bans for ethnic, religious, territorial, or exclusive parties. Scholars have already nuanced the consequences of ethnic parties, and the abuses of ethnic party bans. However, we lack assessments on the effects of such bans on voters, such as those belonging to ethnic minorities. In short, does an ethnic party ban negatively influence voter perceptions of discrimination, namely the feeling of being treated more unfairly by the government? The study hypothesizes that ethnic party bans might have negative consequences for democracy by increasing the perceived exclusiveness of the regime and the predicament of ethnic groups, in particular for those (usually, minorities) affected by the ban. We test this claim on Afrobarometer data, and controls on characteristics at individual, ethnic group and country level. Although applied to Sub-Saharan Africa, the research has broad implications for democratization and conflict research.	NA
2023	1592	CP31	Overcoming the colonial past: Ethnic mobilization and inclusion in Latin America	What is the impact of ethnic mobilization on nation-building in Latin America? The limits to the political communities emerging from independence were heavily influenced by the region’s colonial past. However, we observe variation over time and across countries, arguably because of differences in ethnic mobilization. This paper aims to test under which conditions groups improved their status within the national project by mobilizing in the 19th century, focusing on the opening of political communities in the early 20th century. Thanks to the novel Latin American Revolts Database (LARD), we can test the impact of revolts from this period. Following previous literature, I hypothesize that ethnic groups that faced divided elites and those who mobilized through formal structures were more likely to improve their status in the national project. Empirically, I identify ethnic revolts in LARD and code elite-group alliances, inter-elite disputes and the use of formal structures to mobilize. To assess their success, I code ethnic groups' political status until 1930. These findings are relevant to understand how groups can escape exclusionary policies, especially those with long-term historical roots.	NA
2023	1849	CP31	Aspirations for National Belonging and Preferences for Resistance among Marginalized Groups	Across the globe, ethnic minorities experience exclusion amid rising ethnic nationalism. Yet, many minorities suffer in silence, fearing that asserting ethnic identity and participating in protest will challenge their commitment to the nation in the eyes of broader society. In this article, I theorize that collective action frames that draw on national symbols and portray ethnic grievances as pertaining to the nation, more broadly, can strengthen support for resistance movements among ethnic minorities. I test this theory through an original survey experiment with a sample of Indian Muslims (N=1,311) in the context of rising Hindu nationalism. The findings reveal that “national identity frames” strengthen support for ethnic resistance while “ethnic identity frames” weaken support when the centrality of Hindu identity to the Indian nation is salient. The findings suggest that minorities are more supportive of protest movements that employ collective action frames depicting ethnic resistance as an act of patriotism.	NA
2023	158	CP32	The Lone Wolf’s Pack: How organizational structure affects perception of right wing extremist threat	Domestic right-wing extremism has been the predominant terrorist threat facing the United States since its founding, however for decades it has been viewed as less deadly than other forms of terrorism or simply ignored. I argue that the organizational structure utilized by right wing terrorists contributes to this mismatch in public and policy attention. I use a content analysis of primary sources, manifestos, and court records to illustrate that the racist far right movement is better described as an ideological network of actors than a string of lone wolf perpetrators. I then develop a theory that highly visible organizations support a psychological strategy, whereas networked and clandestine structures support a recruitment and movement-building strategy. Lastly, I collect data from an original survey experiment, testing whether priming respondents about the presence of violent hate groups in the crowd at the January 6th insurrection affects whether they view far right organizations as a threat to democracy in the United States and/or internationally. This study contributes to our understanding of terrorist strategies and specifically to our understanding of the extreme right.	NA
2023	1693	CP32	Are governing populist parties perceived as more moderate?	Research on the public perception of political parties shows that informational cues matter for the assessment of party positions. Still, the role of government participation deserves more investigation. Gaining office should be a particularly important signal for populist and radical parties to be perceived as part of the political establishment. Indeed, the inclusion in a government coalition would legitimize them and boost their image as moderate actors. I hypothesise that in general, a populist party is perceived as more moderate when included in a government coalition. Additionally, I expect a moderating effect of supporting the party on the perceived position. In fact, voters who dislike the party also tend to inform themselves less about it and rely on weaker cues to assess its stances. Non-supporters would therefore be more permeable to the portraying of those actors as radical or, conversely, as legitimate government members, in the media. Relying on survey and panel data on the public perception of Podemos (Spain), FPÖ (Austria) and Fratelli d’Italia (Italy), this paper contributes to the study of coalition heuristics and populism in power.

2023	949	CP32	Anti Immigration Vote in the City Center	The urban rural divide in voting for anti immigration parties is one of the most striking patterns in contemporary Western democracies. Why are cities different? In large cities, segregation reduces the probability of contact between immigrants and natives and, hence, it reduces the salience of the immigration issue in the decision of how to cast a ballot. I show that citizens of large cities in France are more likely to vote more for far-right parties in response to immigration when segregation is low. The effect fades away as segregation increases. When the electoral response to immigration is analysed at the polling station level, i.e. when segregation is naturally controlled for, then standard results in the literature appear; more immigration is associated with more far-right vote, and more so if immigrants compete with natives for welfare.

2023	1049	CP33	Roads to minipublic success: A comparative study of “top-down” and “bottom-up” pathways to minipublic uptake	Not only is the public use of deliberative minpublics on the rise around the globe, some have claimed that this is accompanied by increasing consequentiality. But the issue of minipublic consequentiality is contested and under-researched. In this paper we introduce a new dataset based on the Participedia platform, enhanced by an “observer survey” updating missing information. The databank comprises over 150 minipublic cases conducted at the national and regional level in Great Britain, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Denmark and Finland as well as the European level (2000-2021). Using Bayesian multilevel analysis, we explore whether there is a “top-down” or “bottom-up” road to minipublic success, i.e. whether minipublic uptake – defined as full, partial or no implementation of recommendations - only happens when minipublics are organized top-down, are designed for policy appraisal and do not contest the preferences of political elites (“top-down” road) or whether uptake also happens when some procedural features are more bottom-up (bottom-up organization, allowance for policy development and non-alignment with elite preferences). We also explore country-level factors, namely whether a political system is open or closed.	NA
2023	1703	CP33	How Teachers Spurred the Women's Suffrage Movement: Evidence from Early 20th Century Sweden and Norway	Leading accounts in comparative politics show that women’s suffrage reforms succeeded due to a combination of women’s activism and weak incumbents looking for voters to shore up their position. The level of women’s activism has, nevertheless, often been taken as exogenously given. This paper argues that women’s large-scale entrance into teaching was a key driver behind women’s suffrage mobilization. The teaching profession departed from common female occupations at the time in being publicly visible positions that involved close contact with communities. Female teachers were thus exceptionally well placed to mobilize for suffrage. We test this explanation using broad cross-national data and detailed data from Sweden and Norway. We couple the uneven timing of women’s access to teaching across the two countries with the notion that women living close to teaching seminaries may be more likely to enroll. Using difference-in-differences, we examine the effect of female teachers on membership and local leadership in suffrage organizations. The paper shows how the rise of women teachers is an underacknowledged way in which democratic equality was driven forward.	NA
2023	372	CP33	Unions and Class-based Mobilization: The Case of Germany	Can modern-day labor movements serve as a potential antidote to the growing success of the radical right? Once core constituents of social democratic parties, labor unions are weaker than they once were and parties with roots in mass-based labor movements have become increasingly centrist, causing them to drift away from their mass-based roots. Many disaffected voters, in turn, have shifted their support to parties and candidates on the radical right. Based on primary and secondary interview, document, and press-based source materials collected in Germany, this paper seeks to develop an argument about the future of unions as agents of (renewed) class-based voter mobilization and, as such, an antidote to the growing success of the radical right. Has the connection between mainstream social democratic parties and rank and file union members weakened to a point of no return? How can unions reinvent themselves as successful agents of labor-based political mobilization in the modern era?	NA
2023	530	CP33	The mechanical effects of lowering the voting age to 16: empirical evidence from around the world	In a growing number of countries around the world, debates about political inclusion once more revolve around age and the question who should be allowed to vote. Countries such as Austria, Brazil, and Argentina have lowered the voting age to 16, while others, such as Belgium, Norway or Canada, have trialled reform or seen campaigns seeking to enfranchise younger people. Crucial in discussions about voting age reform are the so-called “mechanical” effects of such reforms. Does the inclusion of younger voters increase turnout? Does it affect electoral outcomes? And do such reforms increase political representation of young people? These questions are difficult to answer, as reforms vary across countries. Moreover, a lack of comparative data makes it challenging to unveil cross-country patterns. This paper presents results of a new comparative study based on an expert survey conducted in more than 30 countries examining voting age reforms and campaigns. The data allow for a first-time systematic comparison of the effects of voting age reforms and campaigns. We investigate the effects on political behaviour, election outcomes, and intergenerational political equality and representation.	NA
2023	536	CP34	The Paradox of Imperial Taxation: How Diversity Constrains Development and Dominant Groups Shoulder the Tax Burdens	I examine how diversity constrains state building through increasing costs of building fiscal capacity and how it results in the core groups shouldering a higher portion of the tax burdens. I argue that ethnic and religious diversity render a population more illegible to the state and increase the costs of the state's investment in fiscal capacity. Higher costs discourage the state's investment in fiscal capacity in more diverse areas and hinder fiscal capacity building there. Higher costs of investment under higher diversity also make the state divert investment to less diverse areas, populated by the core groups. This places the tax burdens of state building on the members of the core groups. Empirically, I test these expectations with an original dataset of local-level fiscal revenues in late Ottoman Empire I collected from hundreds of archival documents in addition to other quantitative and qualitative data from archival sources. I find that wartime increases in fiscal capacity were higher in less diverse localities and the mechanism that drives this difference is diversity discouraging investment in fiscal capacity by increasing its costs.

2023	816	CP34	The Diffusion of the Modern State	The modern state, defined as a state that can raise revenues with a centralized system of taxation and expert bureaucracies, emerged in early modern Europe. Existing theories of state building are developed specifically based on this Western European trajectory to fiscal and bureaucratic centralization. Yet, recent literature shows that the European path to modern state building is not repeated in the developing world. So, how did the modern state develop across the world? This study argues that it diffused to the world from Western Europe through two mechanisms: competition and colonization. Using a cross-country dataset of colonized and non-colonized countries, the analysis shows that the impact of early (pre-1500) statehood on current state capacity is conditional on colonization. Early statehood is positively associated with modern state capacity for non-colonized countries (diffusion with competition), while the relationship between early statehood and modern state capacity is negative for colonized countries (diffusion with colonization). I support this global analysis with a closer look at the selected cases of diffusion across the world to illustrate the mechanisms.	NA
2023	872	CP34	It's the state, stupid! How state capacity affects equitable social policy in authoritarian regimes	Contemporary autocrats are increasingly susceptible/dependent on their ability to deliver social benefits and services as well as concrete social outcomes. By providing policy concessions, autocrats strengthen their position in power. In this article we contend that state capacity ultimately influences equal provision of social benefits and services in healthcare and education. We do so by identifying three distinct, although interrelated, mechanisms through which state capacity determines equitable social policy. Administrative capacity allows the regime to successfully implement its intended social policy decisions, extractive capacity has a direct effect on both tax revenues and social policy outcomes, and coercive capacity determines the success of the state to promptly respond to citizens’ demands for social benefits and services. Our empirical approach draws on a set of static and dynamic regressions models for over 120 countries from 1960 to 2016. The findings confirm that state capacity enhances equitable social policy in authoritarian contexts, although the effect tends to dissipate in the long run. The results hold in various robustness tests.	NA
2023	952	CP34	Laying Down the Principles: How Local Socialist Achievements Spurred National Bourgeoise Support for Public Pensions	We develop a perspective of locally embedded welfare state development to explain how relatively weak national political actors can nonetheless shape national welfare policy over time by pursuing local reforms. Empirically, we assess our argument by using municipality-level vote shares, data on pension reforms, roll call votes from parliament and archival material from early 20th-century Norway, where several local governments introduced non-contributory old-age pensions before a national scheme was adopted. We show, first, how (nationally weak) socialist parties with geographically concentrated support introduced local pensions. Over time, they thus shaped the possibility space for national reform, locking the national policy-agenda to a pension system preferred by the socialists, namely non-contributory pensions. Citing high municipality debt pressures in their constituencies, bourgeoise politicians from districts with local pensions eventually supported and promoted national-level pension reform. This, in turn, spurred the cross-class alliance required to establish a national non-contributory pension system.	NA
2023	1711	1711	Throw the regional rascals out! A study on the alternation of regional governments.	One of the main features of democracy is that citizens can vote the incumbents out of office. This accountability mechanism should guarantee that governments are responsive to the preferences of its citizens. Even though most regions in Europe now have some form of electoral democracy, electoral accountability at the regional level has received little attention. This lack of attention is surprising given that parliamentary-executive relations at the regional level are quite different from those at the national level. In addition, there are several reasons to expect that electoral accountability might be obfuscated: as regional government formations follow consociational norms in many regions, numerous regions are dominated by a single party, and national parties can influence strategies of regional party branches. In this paper, we explore the link between regional election results and regional government alternations. We study all the regional governments that were been formed in almost 3.000 regional elections in 294 regions, in 15 Western European countries. The results indicate that how regional electoral democracy is organized strongly influences whether regional government formations are responsive to regional election results.	NA
2023	1903	CP35	Accountability & Cabinet Membership in Presidential Systems	Questions of accountability and responsibility in parliamentary systems have received significant attention, including where coalitions blur lines of accountability. Voters may wonder about the degree to which a particular policy failure can be blamed on the minister occupying the portfolio overseeing the policy area and the degree to which the cabinet bears responsibility. The same questions can be asked about coalition cabinets in presidential systems. The study of accountability in presidential systems has generally focused on the president and has not asked whether the president’s cabinet parties are seen to share in her responsibility. While the president's status may make her a more obvious target, voters may also hold the president's coalition partners accountable. We examine whether voters hold presidential cabinets accountable and, if so, whether voters primarily hold the president’s party responsible or whether the responsibility is shared with members of the president’s coalition. We then examine whether institutional factors affect the clarity of responsibility in presidential cabinets, in particular, whether greater presidential powers concentrate responsibility in the office of the president.

2023	234	CP35	Global Aid and Local Politician Effort: Evidence from Kenya	Does aid undermine incentives for local politicians to provide public goods? Even when politicians have no control over aid, they can claim credit for the aid under low information environments, thus undermining their other efforts to provide public goods. I test these predictions using Kenya's Constituencies Development Fund (CDF), which provides an ideal opportunity to measure legislators’ efforts since I can attribute CDF spending patterns directly to politicians. I examine two dimensions of these efforts: how much CDF they spent and how quickly they implemented their projects. Contrary to existing predictions, aid is not associated with how much CDF politicians spend. However, without political competition, I find that a 40\% increase in aid is associated with a one-half-a-month delay in the median duration of CDF projects--an effect that disappears in competitive races. I provide a game-theoretic account for why aid windfalls may delay but not diminish local public goods.	NA
2023	261	CP35	The Political Poverty Cycle: Electoral Manipulations of Development Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa	We investigate the existence of Political Business Cycles (PBCs) in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are good theoretical reasons to expect such effects in Africa, and evidence for them in other regions, but no recent studies of PBCs in Africa. Moreover, the evidence that does exist focuses on policy instruments but not on realised outcomes on which citizens are likely to condition their votes. Making use of attitudinal data and objective indicators of goods and services from both Afrobarometer surveys and Demographic and Health Surveys, we demonstrate clear evidence of PBCs for a variety of development outcomes across SSA. This includes subjective assessments of living conditions as well as various objective measures of poverty based on asset ownership and access to goods and services. These findings hold across both data sources and are robust to a variety of specifications. Moreover, differentiating between outcomes we find that PBCs are less likely for gridded goods, the provision of which is harder to manipulate. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the link between electoral competition and development outcomes in Africa and elsewhere.	NA

Does retrospective voting -- the bread and butter of electoral accountability -- still occur under such informational environments? Identifying policy failure, policy success, and political responsibility can be extremely difficult under these conditions. We argue that local economic development predicts local electoral results. Local development, as opposed to national fortune, is observable by individual voters independently of information from the media or politicians. We test this hypothesis using a novel dataset on geolocated polling station results following the 2011, 2016, and 2021 Zambian elections, combined with multiple remote sensed measures of local economic development.

2023	129	IR01	The Politics of Anti-Meddling Policy	Foreign meddling in elections poses a substantial threat to democracy in many countries. Despite this threat, significant variation exists in the extent to which countries regulate foreign involvement in their elections. We have little understanding of the conditions under which elected officials will allow or oppose foreign influences on their elections. Furthermore, when countries do attempt to deter foreign influences on their elections, we do not have a systematic account of the strategies they use and why. In recent years, countries have taken actions that range from passing new laws against foreign donations to parties and candidates to diplomatic retaliation for meddling attempts. This paper theorizes variation in anti-meddling policies as being best explained by the different types of international threats that countries face as well as their different domestic political environments. It then tests the observable implications of the theory using new survey evidence as well as case studies of debates surrounding anti-meddling policies in several democracies.	NA
2023	1559	IR15	Getting to yes: Messages for success in peace referendums	Referendums are increasingly used following conflict as a way to ensure public buy-in for a proposed new set-up. They are seen as bringing legitimacy to the post-conflict structures and are often encouraged by the international community within a liberal peace framework. Recently scholars have started to look at what factors help referendums to be approved. However, a focus on the content of the campaign is missing from this research. We turn the lens onto the messages that are used during the campaigns, to examine which messages most resonate with constituents and under what conditions? Using a novel database of detailed messaging in 24 consensual conflict referendums held from 1989-2020, we evaluate peace referendum success using Crisp Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The findings have implications for the promotion of referendums as a way to solve conflict.	NA
2023	1728	IR01	Violence in Local Elections: Evidence from West Bengal, India.	Research shows that incumbents are primary perpetrators of election violence. Building on this insight, the paper tries to disentangle the forms of violence used by the incumbent to manipulate elections. I present a novel theory and evidence on the diverse strategies of violence used by incumbents, by documenting the use of both extreme and subtle forms of election violence. The argument is that competitiveness is a decisive factor in determining the escalation of violence during local elections. I explore my theory using the Indian state of West Bengal because it has held competitive and extremely violent elections since 1970. This paper uses mixed methods to test the logic of incumbent dominated violence and its implications for establishing electoral control. I test my expectations with novel data on 3,000 local electoral units. I combine this with original data on violence from local elections. I complement this with interviews from political actors. Preliminary findings indicate that violence is used to systematically demobilize opponents. Further, intimidation is widespread in incumbent controlled units. These findings have important implications for decentralization, and subnational authoritarianism research.	NA
2023	304	IR01	Elections Ahoy! The Impact of Political Constraints on Counterterrorism	Countering terrorists through violence is common, as otherwise would be costly for governments. Nevertheless, we occasionally observe that governments taking this cost by adopting non-violent strategies such as engaging in peace talks. Hence, under what circumstances leaders choose non-violent measures rather than violent ones? This study empirically investigates the role of two domestic political constraints in leaders’ decision-making, namely regime institutions and leader experience. We argue that inexperienced leaders tend to use violence, while experienced ones may adopt conciliatory tactics, as the former are more risk prone to prove their strong leadership in their short tenure. However, we also contend that institutional mechanisms could moderate this effect depending on the level of constraints they impose. Drawing on a dataset on governments’ counterterrorism policies, we find that longer leader tenure increases the use of non-violent counterterrorism policies conditional on democratization level as well as government system (i.e., presidential vs. parliamentarism) of a country. Our findings contribute to the conflict studies by revealing the impact of leader and organizational-level factors on counterterrorism strategies.	NA
2023	708	IR01	Voting for Violence: Violence as an Electoral Strategy in Democracies	Political violence persists in many democracies, and politicians at times condone, incite, or even sponsor violence. We explain when and why political parties in democracies use violence as an electoral strategy. Integrating interpretive and instrumentalist accounts, we argue that politicians use violence for one of two aims vis-à-vis the audience; to coerce those targeted with violence, or to mobilize those sympathetic to the perpetrators. While violence may have both effects at once, we argue that politicians tend to prioritize one over the other, with each type having distinct implications for the actors, targets, geography, and cleavages of violence. Incumbents use violence primarily coercively, targeting the opposition in areas where it is expanding its control. In contrast, opposition parties use violence to mobilize electoral support, targeting competitive and demographically diverse districts in which cleavages can be sharpened through violence. We find support for the empirical implications of our argument in India. Our analysis relies on novel micro-level data on election results and political violence for more than 90,000 polling booths. We complement these data with qualitative content analysis of campaign speeches.	NA
2023	1101	IR02	Experimental Evidence that Putin’s Propaganda Elicited Strong Support for War Among Russians	In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Putin regime used extensive and aggressive propaganda to win public support for the war. But can such propaganda really convince ordinary people? Utilizing the unique timing of a survey experiment fielded a year before the invasion, we provide the first experimental evidence of the effectiveness of such propaganda among Russian citizens. Vignette treatments containing information on threats similar to stories running in Russian media around the time of the invasion in combination with statements from President Putin show that propaganda was highly effective. Even mild treatments were enough to increase support for war against neighboring countries among Russians from around 8% to 48%, and even up to 59% among Putin’s supporters. Thus, the Russian President had good reasons to believe that he could control popular opinion when he made the risky decision to launch a war against Ukraine.	NA
2023	1123	IR11	Who Support What? Understanding Domestic Support for Economic Sanctions	What impacts domestic support for economic sanctions? Existing research on sanctions and public opinion have focused on how sanctions have impacted or shifted public opinion in target states (Alexeev 2020; Grossman et al. 2018; Frye 2019). However, domestic factors are also important determinants in the implementation and the specifics of economic foreign policy, including sanctions (McLean and Whang 2014; Webb 2018). Less work has been undertaken to distill the roots of public support for sanctions. Yet, as economic foreign policies are often rooted in domestic politics, public support has important implications on the duration of sanctions and the efficacy of the eventual sanction design. Conventional wisdom suggests that multilateral sanctions are often favored for their perceived legitimacy, both domestic and international, as well as their heightened coerciveness. However, these may also come with trade-offs with regards to the scope and severity of the measures the sender is able pursue. We examine the sender state public’s preferences over sanctions policies. Utilizing a conjoint survey experiment conducted on American adults, we illustrate the trade-offs made by citizens over efficacy and legitimacy.	NA
2023	1196	IR02	Make war not love? Escalation, concessions and domestic support for war-time dictators.	How do concessions, escalations and military setbacks influence domestic support for dictators at war? Audience-cost theories imply that domestic frustration with an international conflict increases the incentives for state leaders to behave more aggressively. Yet, due to the difficulty of measuring incumbent support in autocracies at war, there are few studies analyzing how war-time behavior affects dictators’ domestic support. We address this issue by using the Telegram channels of Russia’s largest war-bloggers to measure incumbent support throughout the first eight months of the war against Ukraine. Using sentiment analysis on more than 300,000 posts, we track how one of its key audiences changes its attitudes towards the regime after key concessions, escalations and military setbacks. We find that military setbacks and concessions substantially reduce support for the regime, while escalations, especially against civilian targets increase pro-regime sentiment. This suggests autocrats, seeking to avoid the ire of domestic audiences, may be locked into spiraling escalation, that – if unsuccessful – may in turn accelerate their downfall.	NA
2023	1393	IR02	Economic Shocks, Domestic Politics, and Foreign Policy	I develop a domestic political theory to explain the consequences of economic shocks for foreign policy. I argue that political leaders have incentives to improve public perceptions of leader competence by linking economic grievances to foreign countries. This linkage, in turn, increases public desire for more hawkish foreign policy. Nonetheless, leaders’ ability to make such a connection depends on whether they can successfully manipulate information about culpability for economic shocks. Therefore, the extent to which leaders can control the information environment determines whether a shock leads to more aggressive foreign policy. I use survey experiments and cross-national analysis to test my arguments. Survey experiments fielded on the American public and a unique sample of U.S. foreign policy analysts show that the information environment systematically shapes elites’ expectations about leaders’ political behavior, public perceptions of leader competence, and public preferences over foreign policy. Moreover, a cross-national analysis based on observational data demonstrates that an economic shock tends to increase foreign policy hawkishness if the shock is more foreign-related or if the public has more limited access to a potential opposition voice.

2023	1552	1552	International Norm Enforcement in the Mass Public: Evidence from three Survey-Experiments	While states enforce norms only in particular circumstances, scholars have argued that norm enforcement is a crucial factor for the maintenance of international norms and the stability of the international order. Despite citizens being able to influence norm enforcement through public pressure, we know little about public opinion on sanctioning norm violations. In this paper, we study the influence of two important contextual factors on the willingness to impose sanctions on the perpetrator: the identity of the perpetrator and the severity of the violation. We expect citizens to be more willing to sanction outgroups than ingroups, and severe violations more than mild violations. We conduct three original survey experiments in 9 EU member states and the UK (N=10,000), dealing with the deficit limit for the public budget in the European Union, rules of non-discriminatory trade practices and the norm against chemical weapons. In these experiments, we manipulate the contextual factors using a 2x2 factorial design. The results have important implications for our understanding of international norm maintenance and add to the increasing intersection of political psychology and international relations.	NA
2023	1055	IR03	Military Service and Immigrants’ Integration: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft Lotteries	Recent trends in global migration have raised questions surrounding immigrants’ national identification and assimilation. What explains variation in immigrants’ integration choices? Seminal theories argue that military service is a critical driver of assimilation, but efforts to study this relationship face a self-selection problem: namely, immigrants who are better assimilated may be more likely to join the military in the first place. We address the selection problem by examining the effects of US military conscription during the Vietnam War using an instrumental variables approach. Conscription during the crucial years 1970–1972 was decided on the basis of national draft lotteries, which assigned draft numbers based on an individual’s date of birth. We use the draft lottery to instrument for military service and estimate the causal effect of service on a range of integration outcomes using granular data from the 2000 decennial census. Our study thus contributes novel evidence to key debates on the implications of military service for assimilation and national identification, while also highlighting a potential role for public policy to encourage immigrant incorporation via national service.

2023	1247	IR03	Settlers and strangers: Migration and conflict in a nativist world	``Nativism'' or ``sons-of-the-soil politics'' is an antagonistic political response to migration. I make a distinction between migrants with the active or latent backing of the state (``settlers'') and migrants without that political resource (``strangers''). Settlers are associated with sustained nativist backlash, possibly escalating to anti-state violence and/or separatist war. Other forms of migration may inspire nativist mobilization but it will be more limited in scope and is less likely to take an anti-state turn. In fact, nativism is self-limiting in these circumstances precisely because government incumbents readily accommodate nativist demands.This paper draws on new cross-national data to simultaneously gauge the impact of settler and stranger migration on nativist conflict. This is the first such exercise to incorporate domestic and international migration into a single analysis of political violence. A case study of Bolivia is an instance of alignment between migrants and the state shifting over time. I trace how those shifts escalated and deescalated nativist violence and policy.	NA
2023	1288	IR03	Hostility, hospitality or something in between? Host community responses to refugees in Uganda	Every year, a large and increasing number of people across the world are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. Despite knowledge that a refugee means someone who is involuntarily displaced due to a myriad of factors (conflict, climate, economy, politics), some actors have used this as an excuse to call for more restrictive immigration policies and an area for anti-migrant mobilisation. This, in turn, is overwhelmingly seen in regions that are hosts to a minority of all forcibly displaced. In this paper, I investigate the Ugandan case to understand when refugee arrivals and presence can call for unrest-related activities among the host population, and when it does not. Uganda is a country with liberal refugee-hosting policies where refugees are hosted in settlements instead of enclosed camps, which implies interaction between refugees and locals on a day-to-day basis. Using process tracing, I unpack potential causal mechanisms that take place. Under what conditions does the arrival and presence of refugees trigger social unrest?	NA
2023	1634	IP11	Who seeks help?: Experimental evidence on providing information to refugees and asylum seekers in Greece	Asylum seekers and refugees face legal challenges that most citizens never encounter, such as navigating the asylum process, obtaining work permits, and being at risk of exploitation. Many NGOs and refugee service providers seek to support asylum seekers and refugees in these precarious situations. There is a dearth of experimental evidence to answer even basic questions about how best to reach and provide vital information to asylum seekers and refugees: What are the differences in take-up rates between information provided through websites (static) and personalized information through 1:1 conversations with counselors (dynamic)? Are there heterogenous effects in take-up rates by gender, legal status, level of literacy or time since arrival in the host country? And how are those asylum seekers and refugees that make use of the static information provision different from those that use the dynamic chat? In collaboration with refugee service providers, we conduct a randomized controlled trial with 3,755 refugees and asylums seekers in Greece and identify the differential take-up rate of static versus dynamic information.

2023	865	IR03	De facto refugee policies and their impact on refugee-related violence	Although refugees are increasingly granted the right to work and move freely, in practice, the situation is often different. The implementation gap between de jure and de facto can be large. Nevertheless, previous studies have relied on de jure refugee policy data, and have used binary or aggregated coding, which does not reflect the complex reality on the ground. Moreover, strategic laissez-faire policies which in practice grant more rights to some refugee groups than others, as it is the case in Morocco or Tunisia, have often not been considered in large-scale refugee policy data. Using new de facto refugee policy data building on earlier efforts, this paper examines the effect of different de facto refugee rights on refugee-related violence. We show that where refugees have de jure rights, but do not have these in practice, the likelihood for refugee-related violence is heightened. Thus, policymakers need to make sure that refugee rights are indeed put into practice to not only guarantee their existence, but also to prevent violence.	NA
2023	111	IR04	Persistent Effect of Religious Repression on Group Identity: Evidence from the Chinese Cultural Revolution	This paper studies the long-run impact of religious repression on group identity in China. I fix upon the legacy of repression implemented to suppress the cultural practices of certain population by examining the systematic attack on religion during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I argue that religious repression suppresses religiosity and group identity of the victimized population, while that effect is conditional on prior demographic and social structures. When religion is tied to group identity, religious repression reinforces in-group identity. On the contrary, in regions where religion enjoys higher privilege, religious repression opens a window of social mobility for disadvantaged groups and shifts the victimized population away from their original identities. Using Chinese county gazetteers to collect data on county-level severity of religious repression in the CR and a difference-in-differences design, I expect that exposure to religious repression leads to weaker religiosity and stronger regime support, especially in counties where religious institutions possess more land before CR. This research facilitates scholars' understanding of the varying legacy of group-based repression from an overlooked niche.	NA
2023	1220	IR04	Governments' Repertoires of Repression: Theorising & Identifying Patterns in Repression Events	Contentious politics research often theorises, measures, and analyses repertoires of contention, but has primarily focused on dissidents' behaviours. There has been less exploration of governments’ repertoires of repression, but this research has been growing and this paper makes two important contributions. First, we introduce the Repression Events Data Project (RED), which uses over 1.5 million machine coded events to identify what government agent represses, who is targeted, and what repressive tool(s) is employed when coercive force is used against civilians (individuals or groups). We use this information to construct repression repertoires that define who does what to whom and how often. We show significant variation within and across country-years that is not captured by common human rights or repression measures. Second, we theorise that leaders develop preferred repertoires of repression and in doing so we explore two aspects of repression: do repressive strategies cluster into identifiable repertoires; and, are these repertoires leader specific or country specific? We argue that governments make behavioral choices about their repertoires and these choices should be incorporated into the study of contentious politics.	NA
2023	1717	IR04	Political and military consequences of indiscriminate nonviolent repression	Curfews are commonly used as a means to control restive populations in conflict settings. While the primary goal for governments is to restrict movement and thus increase their military advantage, curfews are an indiscriminate and disruptive tool with negative effects on the social and economic life of civilians. Despite their extensive use, we have a limited understanding of their impact. We leverage the closeness of two national elections in Turkey and the concurrent implementation of curfews with novel data in a difference-in-differences analysis to examine their effects on voting and violence. Our results show that curfews decrease support for the ruling party but increase support for the Kurdish and Turkish nationalist opposition parties. They also appear to increase the number of rebel attacks in the areas they are implemented. This paper sheds light on the backlash effects of indiscriminatory practices and contributes to the literature on government measures to control civilian populations during conflict.	NA
2023	1994	IR04	Democracies & Repression: Use of Law for Increased Domestic Coercive Capacity	Do democracies use the law to repress? In this paper, I identify three plausible reasons why democracies take recourse to the law to increase their coercive powers. First, as a socialized act of democratic norms and liberal ideals that believe in the rule of law. The belief that laws matter means that legal legitimacy is required to enact coercion within a state’s boundaries. Second, as a means of upholding their commitments to international human rights laws. Unlawful repression could trigger backlash from an international audience. Third, as a shield to sustain their democratic credentials while being able to use force with impunity. Laws can serve as a signal of a deliberative democratic process even if the content of the laws are undemocratic. I leverage unique archival data on India’s counterinsurgency law to test these mechanisms. Specifically, the ministerial files on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and the parliamentary debates around them. Through process tracing, I find strong evidence for centralizing and increasing the repressive power of the state while not wanting to appear overtly authoritarian.	NA
2023	376	IR04	Institutionalized Abuse: State Incentivization and Human Rights Abuse	Why do governments abuse their citizens? Traditionally, scholars have examined state violence against civilians through the nexus of repression and dissent, while more recent work examines certain violence in the lens of oppression and agency loss. I build on our understanding of political violence, arguing that along with dynamics surrounding agents, societal hierarchies can motivate state principals into preferring abuses of marginalized populations as well. I examine the state principal impetus across three dimensions: constituent connections and support, maintenance of privilege, and dissonance with liberal institutions. I theorize that factors in each dimension can impact state preferences for violence against marginalized groups, and entrench the core source of violence against marginalized peoples – societal hierarchies. To examine violence against marginalized peoples, I utilize the victim-identification typology of The Ill-Treatment and Torture Dataset (ITT) (Conrad, Haglund and Moore 2013) in conjunction with the human rights abuse allegations of the Sub-National Analysis of Repression Project (Cordell et al. 2021) to build an allegation level dataset that includes the identification of victims of human rights abuse victims.

2023	1139	IR08	Structural Violence and Terrorism Tactics: Gender Inequality and the Utilization of SGBV and Indiscriminate Political Violence	Recently, authors have devoted increasing attention to the notion of gender inequality as a structural antecedent to terrorism and terrorist tactics, bolstered by extant literature which supports a relationship between gender parity and conflict mitigation as well as growing calls among scholars and policymakers for the integration of gender measures into counterterrorism agendas and initiatives. I seek to contribute to this burgeoning research agenda by proposing and testing a theory which argues that the structural implications of socioeconomic and political gender gaps drive the nature of terrorist attacks. I propose a panel analysis of the use of sexual and gender-based as well as indiscriminate violence among terrorist groups, analyzing the ways in which gender inequality shapes the utilization of specific facets of political violence.

2023	1162	IR05	Recruited Men, Breadwinning Women and the `Re-gendering' of Postwar Societies	What is the impact of mass warfare on women's labor rights? I point to the role of mass warfare in establishing restrictions on women's labor. Mass warfare is commonly theorized as a watershed moment for women entering the labor market to replace male labor. Contrary to this popular account, I argue that cash-strapped governments seek to economically reintegrate (male) veterans by pushing women out of their wartime occupations. I attribute this policy to government's fiscal constraints which make compensation policies for veterans' military service costly. As a result, demobilization reverses the progress women attain in wartime. I investigate this claim in the context of post-WW1 Great Britain, with a focus on sex-specific protective labor legislation. Leveraging differential levels of compensation for able-bodied and disabled veterans, I show that discriminatory labor practices were reinstated where veterans were less compensated by the state. I amend a growing literature that sees warfare as a driver of welfare policies.	NA
2023	1623	IR05	Female empowerment and extreme violence against women	Why does extreme violence such as bombing sometimes kill high proportions of women? An extensive literature seeks to understand indiscriminate attacks, but the gendered dynamics of such violence have largely been ignored. Another line of research seeks to explain gender-based violence such as sexual assault, but far less is known about a widespread and important phenomenon that we call extreme violence against women -- explosive attacks disproportionately affecting women. This violence often hits what we describe as feminine gendered spaces, locations with a preponderance of women. We theorize that female empowerment raises the costs of extreme violence against women, making it less likely. Empirically, we introduce new global data on explosive violence targeting women. Countries with higher female empowerment experience less explosive violence targeting women, taking many alternate explanations and potential endogeneity into consideration. Female empowerment is not related to other types of violence such as terrorism generally, battlefield violence, or sexual violence. The findings highlight gendered aspects of violence inside armed conflict and out, demonstrate an important implication of female empowerment, and lay the groundwork for continued research.	NA
2023	1624	IR05	The intergenerational transmission of attitudes: Evidence from the Rwandan genocide	Does exposure to genocide violence impact survivors‘ attitudes towards domestic violence? Research has demonstrated that conflict affected societies are at risk of heightened levels of violence against women post-conflict as violence shifts from the ‘theatre of war’ into the home. This is often explained by the normalisation of violence. We ask if such learned behaviour transforms into a shift in attitudes that is still visible after decades - and if these attitudes are passed on to following generations. Combining newly updated Rwandan gacaca court records with three waves of DHS survey data, we show that individuals who live in areas with higher levels of genocide violence are more likely to perceive wife beating as justified. Furthermore, the negative impact of the genocide appears to span generations as we find similar effects for survivors‘ children. Our study contributes to research on the lasting legacies of conflict and underscores that these effects may be transmitted across generations.	NA
2023	1002	IR23	Do Prospective Expectations in Conflicts Shape Popular Willingness to Compromise, or Vice Versa? Evidence From Israel	In violent conflicts, can shifts in forward-looking expectations about resolution change the public’s ideological willingness to compromise? Or do ideological positions shape such expectations instead? This question reflects a broader, and unsettled, scholarly debate about the causal direction between prospective beliefs and partisan preferences. However, it has not been studied closely in violent contexts, where it is particularly consequential. In the paper, we disentangle this endogenous relationship empirically using rich survey data on Israeli-Jewish attitudes regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Leveraging aggregate monthly series spanning two decades and two historical moments with exogenous shocks to expectations, we find that changes in forward-looking beliefs do shift ideological preferences for compromise, including across partisan camps. We do not find evidence for the opposite causal relationship. The findings contribute to our understanding of the interrelations between prospective expectations and ideological preferences and carry important implications for conflict resolution strategies.	NA
2023	1514	IR23	Public attention and media discourse during the war in Ukraine: Influence on German and British government policy	The Russian attack on Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has turned into a bloody and protracted war. Ukraine proved to be extremely resilient, but for a successful defence, the country urgently needs the support of its Western allies. As Ukraine is not part of any formalised defence alliance, the constant generation of attention through the media as well as the conveyance of the feeling in the Western partner countries that they are fighting for the right cause are crucial. This paper examines the question of what influence media coverage has on the willingness of national governments to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle. It compares media coverage in Germany and the UK as well as the actions of the national governments of both countries. Methodologically, the study uses a corpus-analytical procedure that evaluates the core statements of important newspaper media as well as the statements of government politicians over a period of several months before and after the start of the war. At the end, a statement on the influence of media discourse on government policy is to be made.	NA
2023	1687	IR19	Who Gets the Guns? How Democratic Values and Security Threats Affect US Support for Foreign Military Assistance	US security assistance frequently flows to the militaries of abusive autocratic governments. While officials typically justify these relationships on the basis of security interests such as terrorism threats, human rights organizations contest them by arguing that they implicate the United States in severe violations of human rights. This paper reports results from an experiment administered on three surveys to test how these competing concerns shape American public opinion toward security assistance policies. Though the results demonstrate a preference for democratic partners with good human rights records, this preference weakens when terrorism threats become salient. This pattern is concentrated among respondents with an internationalist foreign policy orientation, suggesting that foreign policy elites, who typically hold internationalist views, may be particularly likely to abandon their commitment to pro-democracy policies in the shadow of security threats. The study contributes to understanding of when and for whom democracy and human rights are more likely to shape preferences regarding foreign aid.	NA
2023	441	IR02	How does the commitment problem affect public attitude? Evidence from Iranian views on nuclear weapons before and after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal	Political scientists have long discussed the causes and consequences of the commitment problem in international relations. However, little is known about how reneging on international deals and agreements affects public attitude in a country that has been subject to the other party's defection. We conduct a sentiment analysis of Persian Twitter before and after the United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known as the Iran deal, to explore how reneging on the nuclear deal affected the Iranian public attitude toward nuclear weapons. Our analysis is based on a list of Iranian Twitter influencers inside and outside of the country and includes more than 10 million tweets. Our findings show the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal has substantially increased public support for nuclear weapons acquisition. We also conduct a subgroup analysis to understand whose attitudes shifted more radically. The results show conservatives' and reformists’ attitudes shifted more radically in favor of nuclear weapons. On the contrary, radical anti-government individuals show the least level of attitude change in response to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.	NA
2023	626	IR11	Measuring Threat and Military Burdens	What is the relationship between wealth and military power? Some scholarship suggests that as nations grow wealthier they spend more on arming—and thus a wealthier world will be a more heavily armed world. In contrast, others argue that prosperity leads to peace and thus should lower the incentives of nations to arm. A critical first step in answering this question is to estimate what a nation’s baseline level of military spending will be given the size of its economy and the level of threat it faces. Surprisingly, no existing scholarship has established this baseline. Thus, we have no theoretical or empirically guided prediction regarding how much a state will spend on arming. We expect that even as states grow wealthier and spend a smaller share of their wealth on guns, they still tend to spend more in absolute terms than in the past. This suggests that while a more prosperous world may be a more peaceful, it is also likely to be a more heavily armed world in which states have ever greater power to hurt one another.	NA
2023	104	IR15	Peace process exclusivity and spoiler management: quantitative analysis and policy insights from Bougainville and Timor-Leste.	Violent “spoiling” by armed groups opposed to ending a civil war is often seen as a key threat to the successful implementation of peace agreements. This is a particularly acute problem when armed groups have been excluded from peace agreements, as they may have incentives to derail the peace process. While it is not always possible to include every armed group within a particular peace agreement, there are numerous ways to manage potential spoilers and minimise the damage they can do. This can include various “carrot-and-stick” strategies such as military containment and political co-option. This paper draws on the new Dimensions of Demobilisation dataset to illustrate the effect of exclusivity on security following civil wars. It then examines how policymakers can successfully manage and contain potential spoilers to prevent violent escalation by drawing on examples from Bougainville and Timor-Leste.	NA
2023	1810	IR08	Peacekeeper Deployments and Coup-Proofing	At the turn of the twenty-first century, United Nations (UN) peace missions were considered a democratic venture and a pure public good supplied by developed states. While this is still the case for financial burden sharing, the recent literature shows that a large portion of personnel contributions come from privately motivated countries with weaker democratic traditions and poorer economies. One such incentive is the profits from standard reimbursements paid by the UN, thanks to low military wages and obsolete equipment. Interestingly, the literature provides contradictory evidence for the effect of troop contributions on civil-military relations in sending countries. While some suggest a coup-restraining effect, others argue that peacekeepers become more likely to attempt coups or mutinies. However, recent findings showed that this effect is context-specific, decreasing in anocracies, increasing in autocracies, and insignificant in democracies. This study aims to improve the existing accounts by providing new findings on this effect in investigating how non-democratic personalist regimes' participation in peace operations affects their civil-military relations at home by looking at the relationship between their troop deployments and coup-proofing practices.

2023	366	IR14	Half measures: The effect of aerial strikes on the activities of peacekeeping forces and Al-Shabaab in Somalia	There is a growing interest in the scholarly community as well as within the public on the effects of air and drone strikes in conflict contexts, and the debate on their utility and ethics continues. Studies so far measured their effectiveness with the available conflict event data, focusing on whether aerial strikes lead to a decrease in insurgent violence. The intended purpose of aerial strikes is to support the troops on the ground and help to achieve their objectives, by securing their vicinities and pushing insurgents out of the area of interest. To evaluate their effects on the ground, we utilize novel datasets from the African Union (AU) peacekeeping forces on the operational movements of the peacekeepers, and the presence of Al Shabaab (AS) militants and activities in the context of Somalia for the year 2018. Results suggest that while aerial strikes may be effective in counter-insurgent operations, they may not be as effective as thought for defeating insurgents in the long term.	NA
2023	547	IR14	Go where you are needed: Improving early warning systems in UN peacekeeping through remote sensing data	UN peacekeeping missions increasingly rely on Early Warning Systems (EWS) to protect civilians through targeted patrolling and anticipatory action. However, existing forecasting approaches used by academics and practitioners are largely reliant on information gathered by human intelligence, including news reports, which are prone to various biases. In addition, many approaches employ complex estimation techniques or operate at a high level of temporal and spatial aggregation. They also tend to add noise by pooling together various forms of violence. All these limitations severely inhibit their usefulness in providing actionable information and facilitating humanitarian efforts on the ground. Borrowing from existing humanitarian techniques usually employed for needs assessment, we propose an integrated EWS that draws on highly disaggregated remote sensing data to forecast inter-communal conflict. These data offer detailed bi-weekly information on vegetation cover which relates to latent and practically relevant vulnerabilities, including pastoralist movements, developments in agriculture and lumbering, migration, and aridification. We show how using these data in off-the-shelf estimation techniques that have low barriers to implementation significantly contributes to our ability to forecast violent events in communal conflict.

2023	662	IR14	Common enemies make strange bedfellows: Peacekeeping presence and inter-rebel dynamics in civil war	Why do rebel groups who hold competing world views cooperate? Whether rebel groups compete or cooperate has profound implications for conflict dynamics, the victimization of civilians, and the likelihood of reaching a peace agreement. Therefore, understanding whether and how inter-rebel cooperation can be externally induced is an important aspect of successful conflict management.To this end, we investigate the effect of peacekeeping deployments on inter-rebel fighting. We argue that the arrival of peacekeepers impose costs on rebel activity and shift power dynamics in favor of the government. This incentivizes rebel groups to re-evaluate the ideological and material costs of cooperating with each other and unite against their common adversaries. We test our argument using data on peacekeeping deployments and inter-rebel violence. We also show how peacekeeping deployment characteristics help to predict inter-rebel violence at the local level. Our findings contribute to the literature on civil war dynamics and peacekeeping effectiveness.	NA
2023	1017	PE01	Trust and Accountability in Times of Polarization: Experimental Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic	The COVID-19 pandemic took place against the backdrop of growing political polarization and distrust in political institutions in many countries. Did deficiencies in government performance further erode trust in public institutions? Did citizens' ideology interfere with the way they processed information? To investigate both questions, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment in Spain in November 2020. Some respondents were provided information on the number of contact tracers in their region, a key policy under the control of regional governments. We find that individuals greatly over-estimate the number of contact tracers. When we provide the actual number, we find: a decline in trust in governments; a reduction on willingness to fund public institutions; and a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We also find an endogenous change in the attribution of responsibilities. In regions where the regional and central governments are ruled by different parties, sympathizers of the regional incumbent react by attributing greater responsibility to the central government (blame-shifting effect). In those regions, the negative information does not translate into lower voting intention for the regional incumbent, hindering political accountability.	NA
2023	1267	PE01	COVID-19, Government Performance, and Democracy: Survey Experimental Evidence from 12 Countries	While the COVID-19 pandemic has taken an enormous human toll, there are divergent views on whether government performance during the global crisis should affect people's views on democracy. When people perceive that their country's performance is comparatively bad, does the buck stop with the government or do they also blame democracy? We test the theory that even in consolidated democracies, it can be rational for people exposed to performance information on multiple dimensions to draw conclusions about democracy. Our analysis uses a pre-registered survey experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500 respondents. To disentangle the relative importance of health and the economy and address endogeneity concerns, we leverage experimental treatments using an instrumental variables design. We find that dissatisfaction with the government is equally driven by economic and health considerations and that it decreases satisfaction with how democracy works. However, it does not immediately translate into more support for non-democratic alternatives.	NA
2023	1980	PC10	Understanding the ‘Infodemic’: Perceived Threats, Media Use, and Susceptibility to Disinformation During the COVID-19 Pandemic	This paper examines the role of threat perceptions and media use in relation to citizens' susceptibility to disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using multi-wave panel data collected by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP) over a two-year period from April 2020 to March 2022, we found a substantial amount of transitions in and out of conspiracy belief at the individual level. We modelled those transitions through a Mixture Markov Chain Model (MMCM) and identified two distinct clusters in the population: one more stable and the other more volatile. Our findings suggest that threat perceptions had complex and conditional effects, with health threats protecting against conspiracy belief and economic threats associated with transitions into conspiracy belief. Additionally, news on public broadcasters immunized the public against disinformation, while commercial news media and social media had the opposite effect. We conclude that the ‘infodemic’ was characterized by a battle of countervailing forces at work, with the nature of threats and media playing a key role in citizens' susceptibility to disinformation.

2023	695	EU09	Hustle and the tussle. How the UK's vaccine rollout impacted EU attitudes in EU countries	This paper examines how the EU’s vaccination roll-out against Covid-19 has affected EU support in EU countries. Following the benchmarking approach, we argue that people assess the role of the EU vis-à-vis the role of national governments and, consequently, their attitudes towards the EU and the national government are likely to change. COVID-19 represents a cross-border shock that puts the capacity of national governments and the EU institutions to deal with the crisis to the test. Our empirical analysis relies on an Unexpected Events during Survey Design (UESD), which takes advantage of the UK vaccine rollout, when the first vaccine in the world was administered (8 December 2020). We use data from the Eurobarometer, combined with data on media reporting on the UK vaccine rollout, and show the effect of the shock on diffuse and specific support for the EU. Results illustrate that the news of the first vaccine dose reverberated in different EU countries, leading to a general increase in support for the EU, despite people became more reluctant on giving the EU more power on health decisions.

2023	976	PE01	Occupational Mobility in the German Low-Wage Sector and the Role of Social Networks	The flexibilisation of the German labour market in the early 2000s has contributed to creating one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe. One in five workers in Germany earns wages below the threshold, and many remain stuck in poorly paid jobs. A recent labour demand shock induced through the government’s lockdown measures during the pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the determinants of mobility in the bottom wage segment. While previous research found that low-wage workers tend to underestimate their outside options, many permanently transitioned out of heavily affected typical low-wage industries, suggesting they may have found better jobs. Combining administrative with original survey data, this paper studies the extent to which opportunity perceptions and (im)mobility are driven by the composition of workers’ social networks. First, I map recent occupational mobility. I then investigate possible spillover effects where realised transitions out of affected sectors lead to further mobility of co-workers through increased visibility of labour market opportunities. A better understanding of occupational transitions is key to designing government interventions which reduce low-wage work through enhanced mobility.	NA
2023	1680	PE29	New Knowledge and Migration: Evidence from a Digital Field Experiment in Pakistan	A large literature on labor migration seeks to understand and mitigate exploitative conditions for low-skilled labor migrants in host countries by focusing on conditions in the host country. Less attention has been given to factors in home countries that may affect migrants’ eventual circumstances. This study examines how the information labor migrants gain in their home countries while looking for overseas jobs affects their migration process and outcome. We conduct a field experiment in a high out-migration city in Pakistan where we provide objective and accurate information to respondents about modal job contracts and about the best-performing job recruiters in their neighborhoods. We find that this information does not have unconditional effects on aspiring migrants' experience of the migration process in their home country. However, it does have heterogeneous effects for low-information migrants who do not have contact with previous migrants and have not migrated before themselves. Together, our findings suggest that filling information gaps can lead to better outcomes for those who are not already well-connected and, therefore, do not have alternative sources of information to rely on.

2023	1853	PE29	Information about Norms: speaking up against early marriage in rural Tanzania	I investigate how information about the true norm of early marriage within a community increases the likelihood of villagers to speak-up for the abolition of the practice. First, I document widespread misperceptions: even within such small, compact, and isolated communities where early marriage is widespread, while most people believe that others believe that early marriage is acceptable (i.e., perception of norm is conservative), the average rates of opposition to early marriage are extremely high (i.e., the norm is progressive). I formalize the relationship between norms' perceptions and speaking-up in an individual decision-making framework and show through a field-based survey experiment that receiving private information about the true rates of rejection of early marriage makes individuals more likely to speak up against the practice in a recorded message to be shared with the local politician or the local radio. Then, I use the generalized method of moments to estimate a parametric version of the model with my experimental data in order to parse out why this information works and differentiate between a theory of social learning and one of reputational concerns.

2023	374	PE28	The Geoeconomics of New Energy Security: Foreign Direct Investment in Cobalt Production	We analyze concentration in cobalt supply, arguing that over the past 20 years that this has been driven by FDI from China to the Congo. We begin by documenting concentration in global cobalt trade by analysing trade distributions by volume from two perspectives. First, we use the Hirschman-Herfindahl index to examine how annual import and export link weight distributions changed from 1988 to 2021. Second, we construct a global cobalt trade network and document the evolution of the cobalt trade network by volume using several measures of network centrality. We then show FDI from China to DRC led to an increase in cobalt ore exports from DRC to China and has allowed China to effectively control the global cobalt market. Finally, we analyse empirical results through Realist and Liberal geoeconomics strategies, arguing that China`s ambitious `Going Out` approach has been the main determinant behind intense FDI policies, which is reflected in the global cobalt market leading to new energy security dynamics.

2023	380	PE29	Connections, Gender, and Access to State-Facilitated Private-Sector Development: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Senegal	In developing countries, access to opportunities within the private sector are often unequally distributed. Advantages accrue to those with connections to the state or to those with privileged social status. The magnitude and location of where these factors precisely make an impact are less understood, however. In this paper, I locate precisely where leakages occur by causally estimating the impact of political and social determinants of access to private-sector development under unevenly enforced rule of law. I do so by implementing a field experiment in Senegal in which I create a registered business and randomize co-partisanship and gender during entrepreneurs’ applications for business permits at municipal councils. I find that co-partisan applicants deal with fewer steps in the application process and are more likely to successfully deposit their applications. Women are more likely to have their applications rejected, despite following the same procedures as men. By highlighting the specific areas along the institutional pathway where partisanship and gender are most influential, this paper offers causal evidence to inform policy to reduce the barriers facing entrepreneurs, particularly women, in developing countries.

2023	1133	IR06	Social Revolution and Behavioral Change: Labor Conflicts and the Republican Calendar	A central goal of social revolutions is to change individuals' behavior and values. Yet, most research focuses on the national-level effects of revolutions, such as military mobilization, political-institutional durability, or land redistribution. Unlike existing works, I focus on how revolutionaries foster individual behavioral shifts that align with revolutionary values. I argue that revolutionaries are more likely to change individuals' behaviors to align with revolutionary ideals the more they reinforce these values across local social, political, and economic institutions. The more officials infuse local institutions with revolutionary values, the more they limit individuals' access to alternative value systems while incentivizing behavioral conformity. I test this argument using subnational variation in the implementation of the Republican Calendar in France in 1793 to estimate post-revolutionary labor conflicts and strikes. The Republican Calendar was designed to support workers and shift the regulation of labor from spiritual authorities to secular ones ostensibly responsible to working people. Results support expectations: in places where officials more consistently reinforced the Calendar, workers were more likely to advance pro-worker positions through labor conflicts or strikes after revolution.

2023	1479	IR06	The Violent Legacy of Armed Resistance. Italian Left-wing Terrorism during the Years of Lead	Are patterns of terrorism in democracy affected by dynamics of armed resistance in pre-democracy periods? In post-conflict democracies, most armed groups become political parties and institutionalize their organizational advantage through parliamentary and local democratic elections. However, memories of armed resistance can be reactivated when new generations experience socio-economic shocks that produce resentment toward the democratic regime, thus triggering violent political practices and terrorist attacks. Italy experienced a civil war in 1943-45, in which left-wing bands constituted the bulk of the armed resistance movement and long wave of terrorist attacks in the 1970s and 1980s (the so-called “Years of Lead”) with left-wing groups as the main actors. Is there any connection between the two phenomena? We have created an original dataset that includes more than 8,000 political events and violent attacks in Italy between 1969-1988 at the subnational level. We find that the local experience of armed resistance in areas with major social-economic shocks for young generations, depending on the local strength of the communist party, predicts political violence at the provincial by left-wing terrorism violence during the Years of Lead.

2023	1608	IR07	Exposure to violence and social trust in Eurasia	While scholars acknowledge that understanding the social and political consequences of conflict and violence are of utmust importance for post-conflict reconciliation, the nascent literature in this area comes often to quite conflicting conclusions. Thus, whether exposure to violence increases trust through post-traumatic growth, or whether it decreases it through distress or fear is, despite numerous studies, still unclear. We argue that this is largely due to the fact that both in terms of the main independent variable (exposure to violence) and the main dependent variable (trust) most of these studies differ considerably. Drawing on a set of surveys carried out in several Eurasian countries affected by conflict and violence and information on the geographic location of violent events, we assess whether the type of violence (perpepetrator and target) affects social trust in a differences-in-differences design. As expected we can show that the effect of violence is heterogenous.	NA
2023	1900	IR06	The Political Legacies of Resistance: How Local Communities in Italy Keep Antifascist	Do wartime experiences other than violence leave long-lasting political legacies? We explore this question in Italy, a country whose democratic institutions were forged in a civil war between an armed resistance movement against Nazi and Fascist forces. We argue that the local presence of resistance bands left anti-Nazi/Fascist legacies that shape political attitudes and behaviors today. We propose that these legacies are kept alive via a process of inter-generational, community-based transmission sustained on core mechanisms: (1) memorialization, (2) local anchors, and (3) local associational networks. We empirically explore this argument by exploiting novel data from a recent nationwide, grassroots mobilization campaign aimed at banning neo-fascist propaganda. We use an integrative multi-method research design that combines statistical analysis of all Italian municipalities to make sense of the campaign's spatial patterns, with a within-case analysis of a purposively selected locality to trace the process by which legacies are kept and transmitted across generations. Our study emphasizes armed resistance as a critical source of war's long-term political legacies and improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the collective transmission of political memories.

2023	296	IR06	War hurts trust, low trust continues to kill: Violence, vaccines, and the cost of war	What are the long-term costs of war? It is well known that wars kill and maim civilians years after violence ceases. However, why exactly this is the case remains poorly understood. Some long-term effects, such as unexploded ordnance, destroyed health infrastructure, are straightforward. I investigate a more indirect, but no less consequential effect: The deleterious effect of conflict on trust. Violence systematically reduces trust, an effect that can persist over several generations. At the same time, trust is an essential predictor of medical outcomes. Distrustful individuals are less likely to seek and follow medical advice, visit hospitals, and get their children vaccinated. By undermining trust, past violence continues to kill. To demonstrate this theory empirically, I combine over 1.5 million data points from various surveys, which I analyze using generalized difference-in-difference models. Exposure to violence is associated with significantly reduced levels of institutional trust, which predict lower vaccination, and, in turn, higher rates of under-5 child mortality. Despite progress made in accounting for the manifold indirect effects of violent conflicts, we might still be underestimating the true cost of war.	NA
2023	1215	IR07	Perceptions of Police Effectiveness in Northern Ireland	A key element for stability and peace is trust in security forces. This is especially important and particularly challenging in post-conflict countries, even long after the fighting has stopped. We investigate who, and under what circumstances, trusts the security forces in Northern Ireland. We develop a theoretical argument for why certain characteristics of individuals and how they relate to characteristics of police officers, as well as the context of policing shape trust in effective policing in a post-conflict context. We use novel data from a survey experiment conducted in Northern Ireland to assess perceived effectiveness of police officers. We randomly assigned respondents to different scenarios with varying levels of local embeddedness and religious community affiliation of a police officer. Results show that shared religious community background does not systematically affect trust in officers in Northern Ireland. Instead, the degree of politicization shapes whether people view police forces are more or less effective. Our results highlight that in a post-conflict context in a comparatively strong state setting, war-time cleavages can over time fade into the background.	NA
2023	1398	IR07	How does recalling violent conflict affect pro-social behaviour? Evidence from a lab-in-the-field experiment in Uganda	This study investigates how recalling violent conflict affects prosocial behaviour. Numerous studies use observational data to conclude that individuals who experienced violent conflict behave more prosocially Bauer2016. A prominent theoretical explanation states that conflict strengthens in-group prosocial norms. This study employs a lab-in-the-field experiment among 700 participants in northern Uganda. Treatment participants recall an experience from a time of violent conflict, control participants recall a non-conflict experience. We find mixed effects across prosocial behaviours: recalling conflict increases (demand for) altruism by 0.17 (0.36) standard deviations in a dictator (ultimatum) game, but does not affect cooperation in a public goods game. We provide a new theoretical explanation for the observed effects: altruism serves as a signal, that increases in strength as prosocial in-group norms weaken. This explanation illustrates how conflict may increase prosocial behaviour increase even in contexts where conflict undermines group norms.	NA
2023	1541	IR07	Intergroup Avoidance: Observational and Experimental Evidence from Israel	A large literature suggests that intergroup prejudice is driven at least in part by informational deficits, suggesting that information about outgroups may help correct misperceptions and facilitate perspective-taking. In this paper, we employ several empirical strategies to critically evaluate the role that online information plays in intergroup relations in Israel, and reach less optimistic conclusions. We first use observational data from Facebook to show that, in contrast to Palestinians, who frequently use the platform to discuss issues relating to the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Israelis rarely engage with these topics online. Second, through a Facebook-embedded field experiment, we test the effects of exposing Israelis to news about Palestinians’ daily lives in East Jerusalem. We find that this exposure does not improve intergroup attitudes and actually decreases engagement with additional outgroup social media content. Third, we use survey-embedded behavioral exercises to document and help explain “intergroup avoidance” on the part of Jewish Israelis. Finally, we another set of survey-based behavioral exercises testing different strategies to encourage constructive Israeli engagement with online content about their Palestinian neighbors.	NA
2023	1469	IR09	Climate change impacts in Bangladesh – securitization, conflict and cooperation	The academic literature on climate change and conflict has so far focused mostly on violent armed conflict. Yet, cooperative responses to climate change impacts are arguably more prevalent than violent outcomes and deserve equal attention. Furthermore, the framing of climate change as security threat is problematic as it has the potential to lead societies to prepare for future resource conflicts and induce zero-sum perceptions of resource access rather than seek and invest in peaceful, cooperative adaptation. We address and scrutinize these issues using unique panel survey data from approximately 1600 households residing in 36 villages along the 250 kilometers of the Jamuna River in Bangladesh – an area affected primarily by floods and riverbank erosion. We investigates cooperative and conflictive responses to a climate-related shock from flood and river erosion including both people who stay and those who migrate. We also include a survey experiment which primes respondents in this fragile context to see climate change impacts as a security threat or, alternatively, as a focal point for increasing cooperation and investigates respondents’ cooperative and conflict-related attitudes.

2023	565	IR09	The Effect of Armed Conflict Exposure on Tropical Cyclone Impact	Can armed conflict amplify the societal impacts and humanitarian consequences of natural hazards? Given that these hazards affect millions of people worldwide and that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is paramount that we advance our understanding of what makes societies vulnerable to these hazards. Existing research has focused mainly on political violence as a consequence of natural hazards but has neglected the fact that conflict can also be an underlying factor that shapes the impact of these events. Consequently, we know little about whether and how exposure to violent armed conflict increases vulnerability to natural hazards. This article investigates the effect of armed conflict exposure on hazard impacts in the context of tropical cyclones. Combining data on the physical storm exposure with sub-national data on disaster impacts and conflict events allows for identifying the independent effect of conflict on hazard impacts. Results show that armed conflict events significantly increase the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards. Consequently, policymakers should consider conflict contexts when designing disaster risk reduction policies.	NA
2023	609	IR09	Inequities in Post-Disaster Aid in Peru and Ecuador	Relief aid is a critical component to communities’ response to natural disasters. However, both international and domestic relief aid may be unevenly distributed across provinces, reducing some residents’ ability to recover in the wake of a disaster. We examine why disaster aid varies within countries, and we offer three explanations for this internal variation. First, we argue that the more closely that the central government works with international and nongovernmental organizations, the more likely that aid will be distributed equitably. Second, we examine the ethnic relationship between the central government and affected areas. We expect that regions with ethnic groups lacking representation in the central government may receive less post-disaster aid than areas with representation. Finally, we propose that existing interstate rivalries can limit international organizations’ ability to reach border regions, thus reducing the amount of relief aid these regions receive. We test our argument in Peru and Ecuador, two countries with a history of rivalry, ethnic representation, and varying relationships with the international organization community. We utilize new data collected by our Disasters, Migration, and Violence (DMV) Lab.	NA
2023	780	IR09	Climate Disasters and Rampant Urbanization in Indian Megacities: Hotbeds for Societal Unrest?	More frequent occurrences of storms, floods, and droughts are among the most adverse consequences of climate change. Especially when such hazards hit ill-prepared societies, devastation and hardship often follow. While numerous studies have examined a potential relationship between climate disasters and conflicts, riots and demonstrations have received little attention. This paper intends to fill this gap, by arguing that these are the events where actually an effect is most plausible. It further hypothesizes that this unrest-inducing effect should be most pronounced in rapidly growing urban agglomerations of the Global South, as infrastructure there has a hard time keeping up with the influx of people. Moreover, riots and demonstrations require spontaneous mass-scale mobilization, which is more feasible in urban areas. By drawing on a novel self-compiled dataset covering 26 Indian megacities over a 20-year period, this paper puts these hypotheses to empirical scrutiny. The results of spatial multi-level regression analysis yield that the likelihood of urban unrest is indeed higher in the months following climate disasters. Also, this effect grows stronger when cities recently have seen a spike in population growth.	NA
2023	934	IR09	Natural Disasters and Child Recruitment by Rebel Groups	Do natural disasters facilitate children’s’ engagement in armed groups? Existing research suggests that natural disasters’ impact on macroeconomic performance, agricultural output, and livelihood makes people, including children, more likely to join rebel groups. We extend this argument, by presenting one additional mechanism that affects children’s engagement in armed groups. We argue that not only the supply side is affected by natural disasters, but also the demand side. In other words, not only children are more likely to join rebel groups after natural disasters but also rebel groups are more likely to recruit children. Rebel groups’ funding sources from natural resources are easily disrupted from natural disasters, hence they have more incentives to recruit children. The empirical results support our hypothesis that armed groups are more likely to recruit children after the hit of natural disasters. This research contributes to enlarge the discussion regarding natural disasters and urges to pay more attention on how environmental changes can affect humanitarian issues in conflict zones.	NA
2023	1297	IR10	Live and let die: Regime type, security forces, and the strategic choice for pro-government militias and private military companies	Pro-government militias and private military companies have recently received increasing scholarly attention. Studies looked at why and under which conditions governments make use of militias or companies both in war and peace times. However, little is known about if and how countries may strategically choose one option over the other, both simultaneously, or neither. I argue that pro-government militias and private military companies ultimately serve the same purpose for a government: battlefield support and security provision. I further argue that governments choose their options according to two primary factors: regime type and the structure of state security forces. I expect more democratic countries to prefer private military companies over pro-government militias. For autocracies, it depends on whether the state security forces are fragmented, i.e. whether a regime is coup-proofed as indicated by a larger number of counterweights, and on the duration of leadership. I test my expectations using data on internal armed conflicts, pro-government militias, private military companies, and state security forces. My findings contribute to the literature on state repression and non-state actors in civil wars.	NA
2023	134	IR10	Abandon the ship! Reconsidering the impact of conflict on coups and defections	In this paper, I propose a framework to describe coups and defections as complementary strategies that the military uses to increase its survival chances when facing a losing war and explain when conflicts trigger defections rather than coups. This framework lies on the consideration that when a losing war increases dissatisfaction among the military, they are likely to consider staging a coup an alluring option only if they believe that they have enough time to either change the course of the war or secure enough personal wealth before the regime fall. In turn, if they believe that the time left before the rebel victory is not sufficient to secure wealth or change the tide of the conflict, then they are likely to consider joining the enemy side as a better survival strategy. I test my argument via a cross-section time series analysis of conflict-affected countries between 1990 and 2016.	NA
2023	1833	IR10	Why Regimes Crumble: Exploring the Logic of Defection amid Popular Uprisings	Why do members of states' political and military institutions concurrently defect during some popular uprisings but not others? Existing research usually studies political and military defections separately and without regard for their potentially different motivations. I argue that patterns of defection are linked to the characteristics of political dissent. While it is well established that defections occur as the odds of regime collapse grow, I argue that they become widespread when dissidents employ strategies that signal their leniency toward both political and military defectors alike. This creates a dilemma that is exacerbated as campaigns progress and as regime elites become desperate to maintain power. The results of a cross-national quantitative analysis and a case study of Serbia's Bulldozer Revolution confirm my expectations. This study is one of the first to directly compare the logics of defection among a state's most trusted agents, and the results have implications for understanding popular uprisings, mass atrocities, elite cohesion, authoritarian politics, and for designing effective strategies of resistance.	NA
2023	320	IR10	Do not blame it on me. Reconsidering the determinants of defections during conflict	In this paper, we pose that the less security armed forces are effective against the incumbent regime’s enemies, and the more the military has a central role in the government of the country, the more defections are likely. This is because tactical military effectiveness and military centrality jointly provide members of the armed forces with important signals regarding the likelihood of a defeat of the incumbent regime and the extent to which the members of the armed forces are going to be affected by regime fall. The rationale behind our argument is that military members are likely to see defections as powerful tools for dissociating themselves from a regime they consider to be on the verge of toppling and with which they fear being identified. To test our theoretical argument, we rely on a cross-section time-series multivariate analysis of 67 countries between 1990 and 2016. Results are in line with theoretical expectations and robust to different model specifications.	NA
2023	323	IR10	Autocrats and their Auxiliary Forces	How does the design of the security sector and the use of parallel armed forces affect the durability of leaders in office? We argue that a key to leadership survival is the design of security institutions and ready access to a loyal and reliable coercive apparatus, regardless of where the regime’s most pertinent threat is coming from. Theoretically, we expect autocratic leaders with parallel armed forces, such as pro-government militias, to outlive those without. Empirically, we first model the presence of militas across all types of regimes before analyzing their impact on leadership survival. Using novel data that identify whether a pro-government militia is directly connected to the leaders suggests that while irregular forces in general do not contribute to improved leadership tenure, personal auxiliary forces of the leader are able to help him stay in power. We further show that democracies and varying forms of autocracies recruit very different types of militias, but that most of them do not bolster leadership survival.	NA
2023	1529	IR12	Rebel Group Recruitment and Territorial Control	Recruitment and retention are important not only for the survival but also for the geographical success of rebel groups. To examine the effect of recruitment methods on territorial control by rebel groups, we conduct a difference in difference model, whereby our treatment variable is forced recruitment practices. Empirically, we can observe two types of forced recruitment practices. The first is a hit and run tactic, where individuals get abducted by armed groups and then coerced to stay. The second type is more stationary, where armed groups take over villages, towns, or territories and establish themselves as new authorities and coerce locals to join the group either as combatants or slave labor. We expect that both practices have an initially positive effect on the spread of the rebel groups’ sphere of influence, because the latter type acquires new territory and the former marks dominance in a new region. For those group without treatment (voluntary recruitment practices), we expect the geographical spread to be contained, because newly recruited members often move towards the armed group and not visa-versa as with forced practices.

2023	1974	IR01	Politics After Conflict: Former Combatants and Democracy	Do voters punish candidates' rebel past? Provisions for the participation of former combatants in postconflict elections are cornerstones for successful and sustainable peace settlements. However, societies that have endured long-lasting civil unrest and armed conflict with the presence of rebel groups have a high probability of falling into a conflict trap, partly due to the state's inability to reintegrate former combatants into civilian life. Former combatants have difficulty reintegrating into society, often facing resentment and ostracism. Subsequently, this increases their chances of rejoining the armed struggle, particularly if other illegal armed organizations are readily available to welcome them. By conducting a survey experiment and elite interviews shortly before the 2019 and 2022 Colombian elections, I address the question of whether voters punish ex-rebels at the ballot box based on their rebel past. Preliminary results show that having a rebel past influences the potential support for a political candidate. Independent of the candidate's political platform and experience, voters seem to focus largely on past rebel affiliation, which appears to influence candidate perception and potential support.	NA
2023	23	IR12	The Lethality of Hostage-Taking in Civil War	Hostage-taking is often viewed as a relatively non-lethal form of violence. Upon the receipt of demands, victims are expected to be released. Despite this, there remains large evidence of particularly egregious forms of hostage killing in civil war. Why, then, do some organizations choose to kill hostages? I argue organizations kill hostages as part of a punitive governance strategy in their areas of operation. When hostages are of no strategic value to the organization, hostage-taking and killing can be used as a corrective action to exercise control over the population. Hostage victims accused of acts which undermine the rebel regime are more likely to be killed than those taken for other purposes. I test the theory in the case of the Islamic State in Iraq with a multi-pronged empirical strategy. In doing so, I introduce new event-level data on hostage-taking and hostage killing in the 31 districts the organization governed between 2013 and 2018. The analysis provides robust support for the theory. The findings unveil important insights for policy and research.	NA
2023	636	IR08	The Effect of Naming and Shaming in Ending Civil Conflicts	Is naming a rebel group as a terrorist group effective in tackling rebel groups? Since 9/11, designating a rebel group as a terrorist has been a common strategy used by governments involved in civil conflicts to delegitimize a group. However, there is little evidence and argument on how delegitimizing a group affects the peace process in civil conflicts. We argue that contrary to the intuition that a government does not negotiate with a designated group, designation increases the likelihood that both a government and a rebel group have a negotiation. The “No negotiation with terrorists” principle tends to be considered as rejecting the room for peace negotiation with a rebel group, but a designation can be used as leverage for bargaining by a government. Employing a newly compiled dataset on terrorist designation and Peace Negotiation in Civil Conflicts (PNCC) dataset, we provide statistical evidence for our argument. The findings of this paper will contribute to a growing body of research on counterinsurgency and offer important policy implications for governments engaging in civil conflicts.	NA
2023	937	IR12	Diaspora Support for Rebel Organizations: Consequences for Civilians	Case studies on the Kurdish or Tamil diaspora illustrate the importance of external material and political support for the continuation of the insurgency, escalation of conflict and choice of rebel groups’ tactics. However, this work centers on external state sponsorship while migration research studies diaspora as an actor in peace processes and development. This paper combines insights from migration and conflict research by examining diaspora as an external sponsor in state-based armed conflicts. In particular, I investigate the consequences of diaspora sponsorship to rebel organizations for civilians during intrastate conflicts. The paper builds on a principal-agent model in which co-ethnicity of a rebel and diaspora group is a key factor for support and compliance. Using unique data on financial and political diaspora support and existing data on state-based armed conflicts and ethnic one-sided violence, the paper conducts a large-N analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that diaspora support reduces likelihood of civilian targeting, specifically ethnic targeting. The paper generates an in-depth understanding of a diaspora’s agency as a non-state sponsor and offers further avenues for studying external sponsorship and civilian targeting.	NA
2023	120	IR13	What Conditions Favor Alliance Formation? Norms, Abrogation Rates, and State Investment Decisions	How do states know when it's a good time to invest in alliances as a security mechanism? We leverage arguments about norms and reputations to build a theory about when systemic conditions indicate that the the time is optimal for alliance formation. We introduce a measure of systemic alliance reliability, which draws on the ATOP dataset, to test these claims, alongside other factors. Embedding our analysis in a replication of Crescenzi, Kathman, and Wood's (2012) alliance onset models reinforces their claim that reputation matters and also supports our claim that states' reactions to reputations are tempered by competing information from the international system about alliance reliability.

2023	862	IR13	Cross-Cultural Differences in Retaliation: Evidence from Soccer Fields	There is a rich literature studying the role of reciprocity in establishing cooperation in repeated interactions. But the form and extent of sanctioning differ substantially across cultures, with some providing strong prescriptions of retaliation and reputation building for individuals. Such cross-cultural differences in the role of individual retaliation have been documented using survey instruments and lab experiments, and previous literature suggests that they can explain a country's propensity to engage in warfare. Yet systematic real-life, observational data on this cross-cultural variation is scarce. This study documents such variation, analyzing data from three seasons of nine professional men's soccer leagues. Players from a cultural background that places higher value on revenge are more likely to retaliate a foul during a game. Players are found to be more retaliatory early in a game, consistent with the use of retaliation as a deterrent of future transgression. Retaliation is indeed found to limit repeated fouls by the perpetrator, but there is no evidence for broader reputational effects. These results provide unique evidence for cultural differences in establishing and maintaining cooperative equilibria.	NA
2023	982	IR13	Pluralism for Peace? An empirical assessment of group-think theory and the causes of inter-state war.	Does cabinet-homogeneity increase the probability of states initiating international conflict? The last decade has seen an increased interest in how leader-attributes such as military experience, education,and gender, have strong effects on their inclination to utilize military power. However, due to a lack of data there are few studies looking at the wider government and political elite. Assuming that certain experiences makes the head of state more hawkish, shared experiences within the cabinet may increase these effects. To measure groupthink at the highest level of government, we use a novel dataset, Paths to Power, which extends the WhoGov dataset and contains information on the educational, occupational, and social backgrounds of more than 30.000 cabinet ministers in 123 countries in the 1966- 2021 period. Based on this information, we create country-level indices measuring the educational, geographical, social and occupational diversity of the cabinet. These new measures allow us to empirically test whether groupthink at the highest level of government contributes to the emergence of inter-state conflict. Our results show that socially homogeneous cabinets are significantly more likely to intiate military conflict.	NA

I gather original qualitative data to map gang frontiers during a city-wide gang-lord turf in 2009-2012 and pair it with a novel individual-level panel of enrollment in public education to exploit a geographic regression discontinuity design. This allows me to compare the educational outcomes of youth who grew at either side of the gang frontier. I further conduct heterogenous analysis by cohort, sex, and student's residency to explore potential mechanisms.	NA
2023	1949	IR17	(Un)Equal Before the UPR - Power and Race in the United Nations Human Right‘s Council‘s Universal Periodic Review	What explains the nature of interstate human rights interactions in the United Nations Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process? Answers to this question have hitherto focused on the effect of human rights compliance or strategic relations between countries. These existing approaches neglect the salience of power status and race in interstate human rights interactions: not only is human rights respect a criterion for 'good sovereignty', with non-compliance carrying material and social cost, the universality of human rights is also contested along racial lines, making interstate human rights interactions fertile ground for racialized status politics. Using data on recommendations made during the first and second UPR cycles and their severity, preliminary results suggest that despite theoretical grounds for suspecting obfuscated racial bias in interstate human rights interactions and international relations in general, there is little evidence of it in the UPR.

2023	349	IP11	Analysis of the Experts in the United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies	Experts in international human rights institutions play important roles, such as monitoring state compliance and providing recommendations, and it is essential for the experts not to serve the interests of their own states. However, the experts are nominated by member states and elected through the campaigns of their own governments. The election process is also politicized, including vote trading and negotiations between countries. Some experts even call attention to the campaigning process being harmful to the value of impartiality. Given the political nature of the selection processes for treaty body members, we attempt to investigate the factors that influence states' decisions to send their people to international human rights institutions and hold campaigns for them. This paper offers an alternative point of view that human rights institutions promote human rights through the political and strategic goals of the government, not despite them, instead of holding on to the unrealistic claim that experts should be independent and impartial. We test this argument by examining the historical composition of the ten core human rights treaty bodies between 1965 and 2022.	NA
2023	844	844	Elite Murder and Popular Resistance: Evidence from Post–World War II Poland	Does killing opposition elites prevent resistance against foreign-imposed regimes? On the one hand, elimination of elites can undermine the opposition’s capacity for anti-regime resistance. Yet killing opposition elites deprives the new regime of useful human capital. Co-optation of elites becomes a tempting alternative. We examine this trade-off by studying the effects of elimination vis-.-vis survival of Polish elites during World War II. Our focus is on the Polish nobility, intellectuals, and (reserve) army officers. We exploit plausibly random variation in the officers’ wartime deployment and subsequent imprisonment. While most officers in Nazi captivity survived, almost all those in Soviet captivity were murdered. We find that municipalities with more surviving elites saw fewer protests against the postwar Soviet-backed regime during the Solidarność-led uprising in the 1980s. Historical evidence suggests that surviving elites positively influenced local-level economic development, thereby reducing economic hardship and grievances against the regime.	NA

Despite an established literature on the topic, quantitative analyses remain inconclusive. We take a large-N qualitative approach to address this question. Looking at the universe of cases in which a resource-dependent state experienced a civil war (N=46), we are able to identify the specific pathways through which natural resources may shorten or lengthen conflict. This approach allows us to conduct a more thorough investigation of the prevalance of the causal mechanisms suggested in the literature and gain an understanding of how multiple pathways interact (i.e. additive vs. counter-vailing effects). The study adds to conversations regarding the role of greed and grievance as motivations to continue fighting and differences observed across types of conflict (secessionist vs. center-seeking) and types of resources.

2023	1827	IR18	Arming Costs Humanity More Than War	Policymakers and scholars have long focused on the costs to human welfare imposed by war, while largely neglecting the costs imposed by arming. Yet arming—the building and maintenance of states’ militaries—is also costly, and unlike war, most states engage in arming most of the time. We explicitly compare the costs of arming and war. The costs of arming can be measured by existing data on national military expenditures, but it is more difficult to assess the costs of war. We develop a novel approach to estimating war costs, based on using case studies of the costs of particular wars to project total costs of other wars from data on battle deaths. We find that, in the last half-century at least, the global costs to human welfare of arming grossly exceed those of war. This suggests that the costs of arming deserve greater attention than they have so far received.	NA
2023	1846	IR18	How Elite Purges Promote Consolidation of Power in Dictatorships	How do political leaders promote the consolidation of power in dictatorships? This paper examines this question by exploring whether dictators' efforts to control personnel via elite purges allow them to further expand their power by creating institutions loyal to the dictators. Using newly collected data on elite purges between 1980 and 2010 and matching methods, I provide the first systematic analysis of whether and how elite purges enable dictators to further promote the consolidation of power by creating puppet parties and paramilitary forces. The empirical results show that repeated purges targeting high-level non-security positions within the decision-making bodies, such as cabinets and ruling parties, increase the probability that leaders create new regime parties or paramilitary forces loyal to themselves. My findings suggest that the underlying mechanism in which elite purges promote the consolidation of power has less to do with diminishing elites' abilities to oust leaders via a coup. Rather, elite purges concentrate power in the dictator's hands by allowing him to control the decision-making processes and make unconstrained decisions.	NA
2023	453	IR18	A Purge Before the Purge: Auto-Verification of Secret Police Officers	After regime breakdown, fledgeling democracies need to deal with the legacy of violence. In some countries, such as Poland, this process included “verification”, a screening of the agents of the repression apparatus to identify those that could apply to work in the new democratic security services. However, a form of self-screening and selection out of security services had already started pre-transition. Secret police officers were trained to know the condition the state was in, observing and reporting on the “mood” in the society. Hence, they were among the first to see the writing on the wall and take advantage of more lucrative job opportunities. On the other hand, officers had conjectures about what aspects of their pasts might prevent them from being positively verified and may have refrained from verification altogether. Our formal model of auto-verification incorporates both kinds of considerations to understand their effects on the composition of the pool of security agents who remained in security services post transition. We test the model predictions using individual-level employment data from the Polish communist secret police, Służba Bezpieczeństwa.	NA
2023	1342	IR19	Does development assistance reduce international migration? Evidence from a large randomized controlled trial in Ghana	Debates about international migration often feature calls to invest in economic livelihoods at points of origin. But scholars disagree about whether development assistance reduces outmigration (due to improved local economic perspectives), increases it (due to improvements in the ability to meet upfront costs), or has no effect. We contribute to the limited body of field experimental evidence in this area by conducting an RCT of a program for the professionalization of artisans (ProfArts) in Ghana, which was funded by the German development ministry as part of a portfolio to ensure 'that Africa's young people can see a future for themselves in Africa.' The ProfArts program provided technical training, certification, financial literacy seminars, and discounted modern tools to craftspeople in the construction sector. More than 5000 artisans were recruited and surveyed in 2020 and 2021, about half of which were assigned to receive benefits, with endline interviews following at least six months after program completion. We report impacts on migration attitudes, intentions, and behavior, and explore mechanisms including employment, earnings, working conditions, and other quality of life indicators.	NA
2023	1396	IR19	Does Islamist Terrorism Still Affect Political Attitudes?	After 9/11, a broad consensus emerged that Islamist terrorist attacks increase out-group hostility, the willingness to trade civil liberties for toughened security, and cause rally-around-the-flag effects. However, it remains unclear to what extent Islamist terrorism continues to affect political attitudes today, with some suggesting that Islamist terrorism no longer affects Western citizens' political attitudes due to repeated exposure. We provide a direct test of the desensitization hypothesis based on a newly expanded meta-analytic dataset covering effect estimates from more than 100 prior studies of the effects of Islamist terrorism on political attitudes in Western democracies. Furthermore, we provide new evidence from two large-scale natural experiments which allow us to more accurately estimate the causal effects of two recent Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK compared to many prior studies. Overall, our results suggest that Western publics have not, or at least not yet, become desensitized to Islamist terrorism.	NA

Indeed, how to respond to irregular migration to Europe continues to be a central issue of debate in many countries. What drives migrants onto the Mediterranean, risking their lives in flimsy rubber boats? Drawing on novel monthly data capturing the number of attempted crossings by migrants’ country of origin for the period 2014 and 2019, we are able to systematically examine the drivers of the demand for rescue at sea. Our time-series--cross-sectional research design in combination with modern machine learning techniques allows us to disentangle push factors pertaining to the conditions in the migrants’ countries of origin from pull factors given by particular policies present in Europe or the capacity for Search and Rescue activities by Europeans.

2023	1940	CP26	Electoral Shifts and Migration: How US Presidents Influence Central Americans’ Emigration Plans	How do political shifts in migration destinations affect emigration decisions in origin countries? We examine this question by focusing on how the election of a new US president affects migration intentions and plans in Central America. We exploit the overlapping of fieldwork dates for the 2020 Latinobarometro and the 2016 LAPOP surveys in Central America with the American presidential elections held in those years. We estimate the short-run effects of Trump’s and Biden’s victories on migration intentions by comparing respondents who were asked about whether they plan to emigrate either before or after the announcement of the election results. We combine this evidence with a survey vignette experiment in Honduras which asked respondents about their migration plans after being given a plausible scenario for the 2024 US presidential election: a Trump victory, a Biden victory, a generic Democrat victory or a generic Republican victory. Through both this quasi-experiment and the survey experiment, we explore the extent to which Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric reduces emigration intentions and how Biden’s perceived relative openness to immigration might increase emigration intentions.

2023	1076	IR20	More than Money: The Political Consequences of Compensation	Can reparations change victims' political participation? I argue that receiving material reparations can increase political engagement among survivors of state violence. I examine this claim with content analysis of victim testimonies, qualitative interviews, and causal estimates that exploit exogenous variation in the timing of reparations addressing the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. I find that survivors of state violence who receive reparations are more likely to register to vote than those not yet compensated. To offer insight on the mechanisms linking compensation to increased political activity, I present evidence that the symbolic dimension of reparations payments is particularly valued by recipients who use this transitional justice experience to update their views about the state. These findings suggest that in post-violence contexts, policy experiences can be a consequential determinant of future political behavior. These results are important for societies implementing transitional justice policies in the hopes of expanding political engagement, achieving long-lasting peace, and preventing repeat violence.	NA
2023	1512	IR20	The Cost of Dissent from War Crimes Denial: Can Family and Neighbours Help Individuals Address In-group Responsibility for Mass Atrocity?	To move towards reconciliation, all sides in a conflict need to engage with former foes and recognise responsibility for war crimes by in-group members. However, acknowledgement of in-group wrongdoing in interactions with an opposing side is costly in post-conflict contexts. Dissenters from ethnocentric narratives of violence that attribute criminal responsibility exclusively to the other side are punished by being stigmatized as traitors. How can an inter-ethnic dialogue with speakers addressing their side’s culpability be encouraged? Drawing on inter-group contact hypothesis, we test whether support from family and neighbours can challenge the silencing effect of dissenters’ stigmatisation. We conduct a survey experiment in Serbia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a dominant social norm proscribes acknowledgment of in-group’s war crimes in inter-group interactions. We find that both family and neighbours’ support increase willingness to acknowledge in-group wrongdoing in Serbia. However, in Kosovo, only family support increases willingness, while in Bosnia, only neighbours’ support has the same effect. The paper advances little understood determinants of willingness to have inter-ethnic contact and address wrongdoing needed for societies’ recovery from conflict.	NA
2023	1841	IR20	Shades of Justice: Victim responses to apologies and punishment	How do victims respond to distinct dimensions of transitional justice? While the conventional wisdom suggests that transitional justice policies address victim grievances and advance justice, the micro-foundations of these assertions have rarely been rigorously tested. To address this knowledge gap, we aurvey over 2,000 victims in Colombia and Argentina. We hypothesize that apologies and severe prison sentences will diminish anger and retributive desires while denials and lenient trial outcomes will have the opposite effects. When we present respondents with hypothetical transitional justice scenarios through a conjoint experiment, we find strong support for our expectations in both countries. However, after victims watch a randomly-selected real-world video capturing pivotal moments in transitional justice trials, responses often contradict our hypotheses. We argue that one reason we uncover a discrepancy between hypothetical and actual experiences is because transitional justice - and trials especially - provide three types of information: 1) about perpetrators' innocence or guilt; 2) about perpetrators' acceptance of responsibility; and 3) about the judicial system. In short, actual transitional justice experiences can reveal information that complicates legacies and perceptions of the past.	NA
2023	252	IR20	The Necropolitics of One-Sided Violence: State Violence and Post Conflict Justice Processes in Northern Ireland	We develop our study of state-imposed military amnesties to examine the consequences of one-sided state violence for post conflict justice events using a necropolitical framework, as described by Achille Mbembe, and engaging lessons learned from the Northern Ireland conflict (1969-2007). This examination of Northern Ireland is of particular importance because of its absence in the broader conflict management literatures. In a revealing gap, extant research on post-conflict societies has been largely limited to conflicts experienced in the global South, inadvertently itself perpetuating what we consider to be a necropolitical bias that overlooks the actions of some state governments. In an attempt to correct for this oversight, we use a novel dataset incorporating NI to estimate a series of logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of post-conflict justice events given conflict-specific characteristics. We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between state-perpetrated one-sided violence and retributive post-conflict justice. We also find strong evidence to support the inclusion of NI in traditional conflict datasets and call for a reexamination of its exclusion from conflict studies and samples.	NA
2023	1380	IR21	Covert Action, Credit Claiming, and Plausible Deniability	Leaders in democratic systems face conflicting incentives when it comes to covert action in foreign policy: on the one hand, they want to claim credit domestically for successful foreign policy outcomes; while at the same time, they want to avoid being seen as having achieved those successes through illegal or unethical means. We develop a game-theoretic model that formalizes these tradeoffs. In the model, the leader has two potential policy levers (one 'covert' and one 'public'), each of which he privately knows to be either effective or ineffective, and an 'audience' (representing both domestic and foreign audiences) holds the leader accountable for both the means and ends of his foreign policies. The model yields the novel implication that leaders will use both ineffective public action and effective covert action simultaneously, in order to credit-claim for the policy ends while maintaining plausible deniability for the distasteful means. This behavior is illustrated with a series of case studies examining Eisenhower's intervention strategies in Cuba and Guatemala, and immigration and counter-terrorism policies under Obama and Trump.

2023	1679	IR21	Cheating Autocrats: How Autocratic Regime Type Matters for International Arms Control	We know that regime type matters for the external aggression of states in crises and, of course, for the prevalence and duration of various types of war. In this paper, we will study how autocratic regime type and changes to regime type, affect commitments to international treaties, specifically compliance with disarmament and non-proliferation agreements for chemical and nuclear weapons. We hypothesize that personalistic leadership is a critical determinant of different autocracies’ options in facing the decision to cover-up or come clean. We will combine existing regime data with a novel dataset on compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including indicators on breach allegations, and regime responses to those allegations. With a series of time series cross-sectional regression models in a variety of specifications (including country, treaty and region-fixed effects) targeted at mitigating endogeneity concerns, we find that personalistic regimes are the most prone to treaty breaches and to concealment strategies, underlining the threat these regimes pose to the international order.

In this paper, we examine how framing military intervention in terms of historical legacies can have geographically heterogeneous effects on voting behavior. To do so, we analyze changes in support for the German Green Party following the party’s support of Germany’s first military intervention since World War II: the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the previously pacifist Green Party, explicitly invoked narratives of responsibility and genocide prevention in his endorsement of the intervention. Using municipality-level electoral results for the 1999 European and local elections, we examine the effects of historical legacies on changes in support for the Green Party following their abrupt adoption of an interventionist policy. To examine the effects of historical legacies on voting, we focus on variation in exposure to Holocaust commemoration, using fine-grained data on proximity to concentration camps and other forms of public commemoration. Our findings contribute to literatures on foreign policy preferences, the impact of historical legacies on political behavior, and the accountability of political parties.	NA
2023	1744	IR21	Signaling support for democratization: international involvement, democracy movements and regime change	This paper assesses whether external signals affect the outcomes of domestic struggles for democratization. Recent regime transitions in the Middle East have precipitated responses from third countries that vary substantially over time. At first, most third parties support the incumbent. When internal pressure rises, and the incumbent resorts to increasingly violent means of repression, third parties may change their stance. Particularly Western democracies tend to change their allegiance from the ruler to the opposition beyond a certain threshold of brutality. The additional support by external actors may encourage the opposition and erode support for the ruler, possibly tipping the balance towards actual regime change. We systematically identify the change of allegiances at a monthly resolution by training a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm on a large corpus of news data. Social movements are identified by the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) 2.2 data. Regime change is measured with V-Dem data. The paper will show whether external signals are a useful short-term indicator for predicting regime change.	NA
2023	1668	IR22	Into the Words: Scoring Legislators’ Records on Women’s Rights	The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has long been associated with improvements in respect for women’s rights. However, these improvements have been neither linear over time nor stable across countries, and recently, there have been rollbacks in legislative protections for women’s rights in countries around the world. These reversals make it clear that a vital step in the process of realizing women’s rights is holding legislators accountable for their obligations under CEDAW. A necessary precondition to accountability is information—in this case, information about the actions that individual legislators take to realize (or not) women’s rights. Thus, in this project, I present an original approach to measuring legislators’ records with regards to multiple dimensions of these rights, using Bayesian models and data on votes, legislative speeches, and other public-facing activities. I apply this approach to one test country and explore its extension in other contexts.	NA
2023	1820	IR22	Measuring Government Efforts to Protect Economic and Social Rights	Under the International Covenant for Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights countries are obligated “to devote the maximum of their available resources to progressively realize the substantive rights enumerated in the Covenant”. Measuring government effort to fulfil its obligations requires comparing what a country achieves relative to what it could possibly achieve, given its available resources. Our approach incorporates a broader conception of 'available resources' compared to existing projects that focus on financial resources. Other factors that lower the achievement possibility frontier include climate, geography, natural disasters, and a history of conflict. We illustrate the usefulness of this broader conception of available resources by focusing on the constraints of nations to provide access to safe drinking water. For each right, it is possible to identify a set of peer countries facing similar constraints on their achievement possibility frontier. We assess each nation’s progress by comparing them to the achievements of peer countries that face similar constraints. Our approach identifies states which make good progress given their constraints, potentially informing policymakers and academics about best practices to realize SDGs.	NA
2023	189	IR22	Quantifying Economic and Social rights Subnational Obligations: Introducing Pilot Data for the Subnational Right to Health	Existing indicators for economic and social rights performance are focused primarily at the national level, and they rely on data provided by governments. This poses two major issues for assessing human rights performance. First, measuring economic and social rights fulfillment at only the national level masks significant subnational variation. For example, California produces consistently better health outcomes than Missouri. Similarly, many national metrics are not disaggregatable by sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Second, existing indicators rely on government reported data- these data are the result of political decisions and political outcomes. They are often not reported consistently or measured the same across governments- both within and across countries. In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, there were multiple instances of governments deliberately misleading or outright falsifying health data. I demonstrate a remedy to both these problems by administering a subnational expert survey on health outcomes, and provide pilot data that shows it is possible to measure fulfillment of ICESCR obligations with this method.

2023	328	IR22	The Repression Information Paradox (RIP): How Repression Has Evolved to Avoid the Spotlight	How do repressive repertoires evolve? In this article we argue that leaders have adapted and updated their repressive repertoire in response to the growing strength of the human rights regime. We outline a theory called the repression information paradox which consists of three parts. First, leaders engage in strategic spotlight avoidance strategies that allow them to escape international accountability mechanisms such as naming and shaming. Second, leaders have updated their repressive tactics to avoid changes in international accountability which has forced the international community to continually change their standards of accountability to keep up. Third, leaders have co-opted new technologies that reduce the cost of repression. The repression information paradox argues that leaders are getting away with more repression today than they were yesterday, despite the growing strength of the human rights regime and, in part, because of the belief that this regime is working. We then outline the implications of this theory for the empirical study of human rights and make recommendations for researchers engaging in quantitative human rights research moving forward.	NA

The coding process builds on an existing corpus of allegations from human rights reports. Each allegation sentence presents information about a specific type of physical integrity violation and may also contain information about the actor type. The information content of the allegations varies, and each allegation only contains information about a subset of these items. Therefore, the information for each allegation is based on a probability model that relates the text contained in each allegation to human coded categorical data of each item. The coding of each allegation sentence is quite costly in terms of human coding time. Our human identified allegation data covers a sample of countries: Angola, Belarus, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, and the United Kingdom for every odd year report between 1999 and 2016. We use this training data to code and evaluate each repression allegation for all countries in the world from 1999-2016 using a supervised machine learning approach.	NA

Explaining the International Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (Non-)regime	Why is there no strong constraining regime on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)? AI induced weaponry has the potential to dramatically alter modern warfare and its impact on and beyond the battlefield is sometimes compared to that of nuclear weapons. As the most comprehensive international forum discussing potential regulatory approaches towards a certain AI application, the Group on Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (GGE) within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) is discussing the addition of a further protocol on LAWS. Yet so far, the group could only agree on a set of nonbinding guiding principles in 2019 and the talks have reached a stalemate since then. Theoretically, I draw on rationalist bargaining theory and develop an argument how misaligned preferences have shaped the high-level negotiations over LAWS regulation and lead to no agreement. I utilize spatial analysis to study the bargaining process. Furthermore, this article contributes to theoretical refinement on what factors impede successful regime formation. Empirically, this article provides the first systematic analysis of preference divergence within the context of the negotiations at the CCW.	NA

History is replete with the failure of militaries that were slow to see the implications of technological change to the future battlefield. Yet, if navigating successful technological change with effective warfighting concepts is difficult at the national level, it can be well-nigh impossible when transformations must be achieved in the context of a multinational military Alliance comprised of states with diverging interests and different levels of military capability. Understanding this challenge requires one to open, what Paul Poast called, “the black box of capability aggregation” in alliances. This paper seeks to do this by comparing earlier NATO efforts to adopt a new warfighting concept with contemporary attempts to translate concepts like Integrated Deterrence, Multi-Domain Operations, and Joint All-Domain Operations. In the 1980s, NATO faced a similar challenge. The Soviet Union’s military build-up had given it a worrisome offensive capability, which NATO could only answer through nuclear escalation. NATO’s response was to turn to the promise of new technologies, like long range targeting, which could	NA
2023	529	IR24	Offensive wars make states	The extent to which “war makes states” varies depending on whether the experience is offensive or defensive in nature. Offensive wars encourage elite collective action by offering clear selective benefits. Based on their contributions, a defined set of elites can be promised cuts from the spoils of war. Moreover, the expected outcomes of war are relatively predictable, since an attacker can prepare to fight against a specific target. By contrast, defensive warfare could not generate collective action. First, it is hard to exclude non-contributing elites from the benefits of defensive warfare. Second, due to the large variability in potential enemies’ military capacities and tactics, it is difficult to assign responsibility for the outcomes of a defensive conflict. Finally, both the collective and selective benefits are heavily discounted, because it is uncertain when – if ever – an enemy will invade. Empirically, I will use difference-in-difference models to compare the effects of military victory for attackers and defenders in the inter-state wars of 19th century Latin America. To examine the theoretical mechanisms, this observational analysis will be accompanied by a lab experiment.	NA

Combining insights from the onshore border-interstate conflict and the maritime conflict literatures, I argue that offshore oil deposits that are closer in proximity to shared maritime borders provide increased incentives for states to engage in revisionist behavior and attempt to claim the offshore oil for their own use. The distinctive nature of maritime borders and offshore oil resources further exacerbates revisionist incentives due to increased tangible salience, offshore oil potentially spanning both sides of the border, and having fewer institutional options to help mediate maritime oil conflict. Using GIS software and PRIO-Grid data, I develop novel measures for proximity of offshore oil to maritime borders, but I find mixed support for the theory. Only dyad-years that have offshore oil deposits between twenty-five and fifty nautical miles have an increased risk of maritime diplomatic conflict onset. The results indicate that more nuanced offshore oil data is needed as well as providing a fruitful direction for future maritime resource conflict research.	NA
2023	1590	IR25	Personalizing Mobilization:The Impact of Public Figures in Protest Events	What is the impact of celebrities and prominent public figures' participation in protest events? Anecdotal evidence from Myanmar’s democracy movement or the US civil rightsmovement suggests that the presence of leading figures like Aung San Suu Kyi or Martin Luther King Jr. can in fact have a strong mobilizing impact on protest movements. We study to which degree the public appearances of prominent individuals in protests affect the likelihood of subsequent protests. Drawing on theories of resource mobilization and framing, we hypothesize that public appearances increase the likelihood for subsequent protests. Despite being well documented for individual cases, this link has not yet been assessed empirically on a large-scale, cross-national base. We combine novel, hand-coded information on the participation of individuals in protest events with the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database to study this effect for autocracies between 2003 and 2015. Our preliminary findings identify a significantly positive effect of public figures' appearances on subsequent protest mobilization. However, the results do not support a repression-dampening effect.

2023	1852	IR25	Communicating Intervention Matters: How Do Third-Party Leader Statements Impact the Strategies in Intrastate Armed Conflicts?	How do verbal clues by third parties impact the strategies of the parties in an intrastate conflict? Although third-party interventions have been studied extensively, the verbal clues by third parties on civil conflicts have been overlooked since verbal indications are perceived as cheap signals. However, statements can serve as effective tools and the strategies and tactics of parties in an intrastate conflict can change with foreign support signaled through the leader’s statements. Based on the importance of verbal indications by third parties on intervention, this study will introduce a new measure, and examine how leader statements impact the course of events in civil conflicts. This study particularly focuses on how the statements of the US and Germany impacted both the state and non-state actor behaviors in the armed struggle of Turkey with PKK between 2010-2019. The study reveals that highly resolved signals by the external states particularly change the actions of the non-state actor. Findings contribute to the third-party intervention literature since the introduction of this new variable measures the perception of third parties in a more nuanced way.	NA
2023	688	IR25	Female participation in stabilizing social movements	Why do some protests escalate into violence while others could remain peaceful? Few studies, however, consider the explanation with a gender focus. In light of this, this paper examines whether female engagement could affect the risks of protest violence and event escalation. I argue that violence is more likely to break out in social movements that lack female engagement as society expects women to always remain calm and peaceful. Such social expectations are so strong that when females break the norm, the social sanction on them will be harsh. Given that adopting violent tactics for women is more likely to face severe backlash, they are more likely to remain more peaceful. Empirical analyses of social movements in Africa and the case of 2019 -2020 Liberian protests support my expectations. Overall, this paper shows that female participation is vital to sustaining peace in civil resistance campaigns.	NA
2023	733	IR25	Infectious Violence: Did the Covid-19 Pandemic Lead to Violent Conflict in Africa?	Many observers expected the Covid-19 pandemic to increase conflict, especially in Africa. Conflict in Africa indeed increased by up to 60% in 2020 compared to 2019. Theoretically, the pandemic represents a –prolonged– external shock in a conventional escalation model and we assume that the pandemic will have a moderate, but significant conflict-enhancing effect, which will materialize depending on pre-pandemic fragility, the nature of the pandemic, government responses, and regarding conflict type. Methodologically, we identify a causal effect by exploiting differences in weekly conflict levels per country before and after the first infections employing a two ways fixed effects model. We find a small causal effect for all conflicts. Longer-term effects are investigated by regression analysis integrating all relevant variables of our theoretical model. Results confirm a small but significant effect. However, classical drivers of conflict are more important. Relative to pandemic severity, countries with more democracy, less corruption, more stable ethnic relations, stricter and faster responses experience less conflict. Pandemic-related violence materializes through repressive government responses (“Covid-19 unrest”) and economic hardships that fuel pre-existing power struggles, often with ethno-regional overtones.

2023	1706	IR26	Going with the flow? On predicting changes in conflict-induced migration.	Political violence in a location is a significant factor accelerating out-migration. Nonetheless, the number of people migrating varies between and within conflicts over space and time. Studies show that the perpetrator and the spread of violence can partly explain these variations. However, additional research is required to test more specific assumptions on how and when different types of violence and their compound effects within and surrounding a specific location affect the dynamics of conflict-induced migration over time. This paper defines the variation in out-migration as phases, differentiating between periods with low and high levels of displacement to explore how temporal and spatial transformations of the various violence predictors affect the transition to a new phase of escalation. The paper draws on geo-referenced event data from the UCDP. For the outcome, geographically and temporally scattered data from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) at the district level for 17 African countries between 2008 and 2018 are combined by training on a subset of countries and evaluating predictions into the future within the same country and for the same period across countries.

2023	1758	IR26	Cooptation, (De)mobilization and Organized Interests in Autocracies	Why are party-based regimes more durable compared to other autocracies? We examine research suggesting that party-based regimes are more resilient due to higher levels of cooptation. Based on cooptation strategies specific to party-based regimes, we examine the claim that such regimes are better able to accommodate diverse interests and thus prevent key political players from organizing dissent. In line with literature on authoritarian stability and empirical evidence from individual case studies, we expect fewer anti-government protests in party-based regimes and that organized interest groups are less likely to actively engage in these protests compared to other types of autocracies. We test our hypotheses using original data on organized interest and the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database from 2003-2010. Our negative binomial models show that party-based regimes are not associated with a lower number of anti-government protests, nor with the prevalence of actively organized interest groups. This unexpected result is supported by several robustness checks. The finding challenges the widely recognized assumption that using ostensibly democratic institutions for cooptation effectively prevents mass uprisings, a key threat to autocratic regime survival.

2023	437	IR26	Ideology and patterns of violence in rebel groups	This paper suggests that ideology as an independent variable in conflict studies has been analysed, focusing on the variation between different groups. However, questions regarding the ideology of an armed movement, the organisation's behaviour, the relationship with civil society, the commitment of each rebel group to the set of ideas they proclaim and how each movement understands the conflict and its end are still challenging. This research analyses how we observed differences in ideology in rebel groups with a shared background in multi-actor civil wars and how that influenced the patterns of violence those groups use. The hypothesis proposed is that it is a micro-level variation in an ideology based on the interaction between the conflict framing, the conflict goal, and the normative commitments of each group in a multi-actor civil war under a logit of competition. Through qualitative data analysis using Colombia's case in a comparative historical analysis, this paper provides a set of hypotheses and presents new research questions about ideology and the use of violence in rebel groups.

2023	501	IR26	Cultural Evolution, Institutional Change, and the Production of Violence: Evidence from the Postbellum US South	How do institutions affect the evolution of culture? Do repressive institutions substitute for culture and influence cultural repression after institutions are dissolved? I argue that in a two-group society, the dominant group becomes reliant on repressive institutions over time which atrophies group norms and reduces collective, norm-related violence after institutions change. I test this argument in the US South, arguing that the white population became reliant on slavery to ensure their dominance over time. I develop measures for the degree of local cultural evolution using questions about descent from the 1880 full-count census and create a novel approach using naming patterns to capture white group norms. I find a negative relationship between the duration of cultural evolution and lynchings. The proposed mechanism, group norms, is supported by less co-ordination of white naming patterns and less difference between white and black names, measured with machine learning classifiers, in places with longer cultural evolution. These findings offer nuance to understanding how violence originates, how cultural and institutional discrimination interact, and challenge priors that different forms of repression will reproduce in similar ways.

2023	1015	IP03	Greening Criminal Records: How Companies Use Environmental Programs to Mitigate Corporate Scandals	Causes of companies’ voluntary commitments to green initiatives still remain unclear. Through environmental programs, firms pledge to costly undertakes whose returns are often uncertain. Although research has started to delve into environmental determinants of voluntary green commitments, we shed light on an overlooked non-environmental cause: criminal scandals. When a company is involved in financial fraud, its public image is undermined. We argue that the firm responds to such negative events by adopting relatively cheaper social responsibility programs, namely green initiatives. This also holds for non-environmental criminal conduct. That is, green commitments cleanse the criminal record of a company in the eyes of the public. We provide evidence for our argument by collecting data on companies’ voluntary commitments to incorporate environmental personnel in their executive board. Our research design leverages unexpected news about financial fraud scandals in order to remove endogeneity between voluntary commitments and criminal misconduct. Results provide important implications for global governance studies. We show that companies' reputation is multidimensional and that public response to negative events can trigger pro-social behaviors even across unrelated areas of corporate social responsibility.	NA
2023	1355	PE06	Climate Policy Costs and Backlash against International Cooperation	The political economy literature is increasingly interested in how subnational patterns of trade and foreign investment exposure fuel the public opposition to international institutions and global governance. In this paper, we focus on an additional dimension of economic vulnerability that – we argue – may be central to the modern forms of domestic conflict over globalization, and an important explanation for public recoil at international integration. Specifically, we investigate differences in vulnerability to climate change policy as a source of political frustration and divisions that push communities in some countries to lash against international cooperation. We present new surveys in the UK that seek to assess if and how communities with different sensitivities to the costs of distributive climate policy form different preferences for international cooperation. Our study of 3,000 individuals from three different geographically targeted samples give validity of our distributional story and highlight the importance that new climate-related cleavages among politically relevant constituencies can have on international integration.

2023	1751	PE06	Extreme Weather Events and Environmental Policy: Which Local Governments Increase Public Spending on the Environment?	Do extreme weather events impact environmental policy decisions? Extreme weather events have been shown to impact environmental concern and voting behavior in a wide range of countries and contexts. There is however less evidence of their impact on policy decisions. In this paper, we look at the impact of extreme weather events on environmental spending by Italian municipalities. Extreme weather often has very localized impacts, and fiscal policy is a key tool that can be used by local administrations to respond. We combine high-resolution data on weather conditions made available by Copernicus and geolocated data on natural disasters in the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with detailed data on public spending by Italian municipalities made available by the OpenBDAP service. We test whether extreme weather events have an impact on the amount of resources that municipalities allocate to environmental protection. We hypothesize that the political orientation of local governments is an important mediator of this effect, with left-wing local administrations being more likely to increase environmental spending in the wake of extreme weather events.

2023	469	PE06	Fueling Opposition to Green Legislation Across the Urban-Rural Divide: Evidence from Germany	In this paper, I explore how political conflict over green legislation is structured across the urban-rural divide. More precisely, I exploit the 1999 Ecological Tax Reform in Germany to study how rural areas react to higher taxation on liquid fuel in times of high gasoline prices. Introducing a new measure, called isolation risk, I find that areas that are both rural and lacking public transports are more likely to vote parties that oppose fuel taxation. I argue that the mechanism explaining this effect is the lack of substitute goods and the inelastic demand for private transports for residents of these areas: they cannot resort to public transports nor do without motored vehicles. Using both electoral data and individual-level survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I show that the the Ecological Tax Reform contributed to a loss of support for the SPD, while benefiting the FDP and the Left. I also show that these changes are due to the mobilization of political competition against fuel taxation rather than changes in attitudes towards the environment per se.	NA
2023	721	BO65	Climate change mitigation as a collective action problem	It is common to discuss climate change mitigation as a collective action problem across countries, in which countries have incentives to free-ride on other ocuntries’ mitigation efforts. Recent work has challenged this common interpretation, both focusing on the policy realities and public opinion data. In this paper I argue that climate change mitigation is commonly understood by citizens as a collective action problem, both across countries but also within country. I present the results of two survey experiments that show how willingness to incur in costs to contribute to mitigation is increasing with other people’s and countries effort. The pattern is similar both at the individual and the country level.	NA
2023	1179	PE03	Agreeableness and Preference Falsification in Non-Democracies	This study integrates a more recent literature on personality and regime support with classic work on preference falsification. Recent research demonstrates that agreeableness is an important determinant of publicly expressed political attitudes in autocracies. Still unclear, however, is whether agreeable authoritarians’ regime support is sincere, or whether agreeable people are more likely to falsely report supporting the regime in order to maintain a positive relationship with others. To date no studies have empirically examined how agreeable authoritarians' regime support may change as they strive to maintain a positive relationship with others. This is a significant gap: Whether agreeable authoritarians are insincere or sincere in their expressed regime preferences has important implications for understanding how support for seemingly popular authoritarians appears at times to evaporate overnight. Using observational and experimental evidence from Russia this study will advance our understanding of why some citizens falsify their preferences and shed light on how autocrats’ popular support can rapidly dissolve. Even more broadly, it will also contribute to our understanding of the sources of compliance and conversion in the face of social pressures.	NA
2023	1571	PE03	Corrupt Legislating: Evidence from Russia	Do corrupt officials govern differently? Although a growing body of work has calculated the returns to public office worldwide, we know comparatively little about how the drive towards financial self-enrichment affects that way politicians carry out their official responsibilities. This paper develops a simple theoretical framework and analyzes new data on corrupt gains among high-level legislators to estimate the governing costs of corruption. Using unique measures of hidden assets and earnings based on the financial disclosures of Russian State Duma deputies, I find that corrupt deputies are less active and more obedient members of parliament. Even controlling for party affiliation, deputies that prioritize personal profit motives in office overall exert less effort on legislative activity, and when called to vote, align their behavior with the ruling regime’s political agenda. Moreover, corrupt deputies are also much less likely to win re-election, suggesting party leaders may reserve and then rotate designated spaces for corrupt politicians in key institutions. Taken together, this paper provides some of the first micro-level evidence of how authoritarian institutions are used to co-opt elites.	NA
2023	1789	PE03	Rotten Eggs or Bad Apples: Corruption Arrests and Public Opinion in Authoritarian Russia	Information about corruption can be a powerful force in shaping how the public assesses politicians and the political system. In autocracies, malfeasance frequently serves as a spark for discontent. As a result, authoritarian leaders often attempt to portray corruption in a neutral or positive light: these are merely a few bad apples, whom the regime is evidently finding success in rooting out. When does the public view corrupt officials as emblematic of a rotten regime and when do they see them as isolated cases of an imperfect regime doing its best to clean house? In this paper, I examine the effects of officials in an authoritarian regime being legally punished for corruption on public opinion. I compile a dataset of millions of public opinion survey responses regarding regime approval in Putin-era Russia from 2003-2020 and combine this with extensive region-level data on the arrest, prosecution, and jailing of officials. Together with a difference-in-differences design, this allows me to identify the effects of the discovery of corruption in an authoritarian regime on the public’s attitudes.	NA
2023	1164	PE04	Economically Motivated Persecution: Witchcraft Trials in 17th Century Poland	While prior research has focused on socio-cultural explanations for witchcraft trials in Europe, we instead examine the economic determinants of witchcraft-based targeting of women in the 15-17th centuries. We argue that economic independence of women may have made them local targets for persecution, and document that the collapse of the female-dominated local industries corresponds with witchcraft trials. We study this link during the peak of European witchcraft trials in the case of 17th century Poland, focusing on two regions at the epicenter of the craze, Małopolska and Wielkopolska. Using detailed, micro-level data on the trials and the accused, drawn from municipal and village court books and testimonies, as well as local data on economic shocks and ethnic heterogeneity, we test both cultural and economic theories of persecution.

2023	1501	PE04	Demobilization Through Inaction: Bureaucratic Delay, Ambiguity, and Frustrated Collective Action	I present a theory of how bureaucratic delay can be used to defuse citizen mobilization. By holding open the possibility that a demanded reform can be achieved through institutional channels, authorities can create uncertainty about whether more radical actions are necessary. This reduces the incentives for contentious collective action and enables authorities to avoid having to resolve difficult conflicts in the meantime. I explore the predictions of the model using original archival data on the processing and outcome of over 4,000 community petitions for land redistribution in 20th-century Mexico (1915–1991). I show that bureaucratic delay often succeeded in defusing agrarian conflicts, that this strategy was more common when and where the costs of redistribution increased, and that villages with a longer history of collective action were better able to secure policy concessions quickly. The data illustrate the importance of local politics and bureaucracy in determining the course of the reform and the way in which bureaucratic delay—alongside repression and redistribution—played a role in sustaining one-party rule.

2023	196	PE04	The Case for Social Science History	In this paper, we discuss five advantages of doing historical analysis as political scientists. First, history often shows that a lot of what we see as general only holds in a certain period. Historical research allows us to avoid truncated samples, where hidden scope conditions condition causal findings. Second, historical analysis enables us to investigate critical junctures and path dependence, something that is well-nigh impossible based on contemporary data but which is important considering an increasing recognition that many interesting political, economic, and social configurations are deeply conditioned by the past. Third, historical analysis sometimes enables scholars to address causal estimation problems that cannot be tackled using contemporary data. Fourth, many mechanisms of interest to social scientist can productively be analyzed in very different contexts. History helps us to enlist new evidence and if viable more data is always better. Fifth, while historians are in general superior at description, social scientists are sometimes able to correct historical misunderstandings because they can draw on certain methods and strong theories.

2023	528	PE04	Indentured Migration, Caste and Electoral Competition in Colonial India	We study the effects of indentured migration from India to British colonies, following the end of slavery, on the very first elections held in colonial India in 1920. Using ship registers of indentured emigrants to the British colony of Natal, constituency-level electoral returns, and district-level economic and political controls, we find that districts that sent more migrants, witnessed more competitive elections—higher turnout and tighter races. We argue that emigration altered local ethnic dynamics in the Indian districts leading to more competitive elections. Exposure to life in the colonies led to greater political consciousness amongst low caste migrants against the caste system, making them more likely to fight the social and economic dominance of upper castes back home. We rank the subcastes of individual migrants using the social rankings of castes in the census of 1901. We show that districts that sent more intermediate castes relative to their share in the population were associated with increased competition. Intermediate castes were historically socially marginalized, and key beneficiaries of the franchise expansion. Our results are robust to using the 1923 elections.	NA
2023	855	PE04	The Economic Consequences of the Black Sea Slave Trade	Between the 15th and the 18th centuries, Tatar raids in the Black Sea region led to the capture and enslavement of approximately four million people, making Eastern Europe the largest source of commercial slaves in the early modern world after West Africa. Despite the Black Sea slave trade's massive scale and distinctive features --- most notably the noncooperation of native elites and the relatively strong capacity of raided states --- little is known about its consequences for socioeconomic development. Analyzing the first comprehensive dataset on Tatar raids using difference-in-differences and instrumental variables strategies, we find that more intensely raided areas initially experienced a decline in population and urbanization, yet went on to not only recover but achieve higher levels of development from the 18th century onward. Our findings caution against generalizing conclusions about slavery's socioeconomic consequences from the Atlantic slave trade, suggesting that cooperation with native elites and the strength of preexisting state capacity play a key role in conditioning such effects.

2023	1315	PE05	Emissions, Audits, and the U.S. EXIM Bank	Governments around the world experience rising pressures to decarbonize their economies. Regulating carbon-intensive industry is, however, rarely easy politically. As governments fear the effects of relocation, policymakers face a trade-off between giving in to public demands for stricter regulation and protecting firms' competitiveness in global markets. We argue that governments, which are constrained either institutionally or by public opinion to create regulatory relief, will resort to alternative compensatory policy for regulated firms. Here, we show that the United States Export-Import (EXIM) bank, which was established to support U.S. firms abroad, can serve such a role. Empirically, we find a robust correlation among the largest U.S. Fortune~500 firms between EXIM bank loans and firms' voluntary emissions reporting behavior. These results are consistent with our interpretation that firms use carbon emissions disclosure as a costly information revelation mechanism to credibly signal their vulnerability to carbon regulation to governments. Our findings resonate with concerns that firms can find ways to evade (environmental) regulations such that local emission reductions in the U.S. are offset by increased emissions abroad.	NA
2023	1945	PE05	Local veto power and the political opposition to wind turbines	In Spain, mayors were able to veto wind farm projects, but this power has been removed in some regions. Which is the effect of these reforms on the strength of political opposition to wind power? We address this question with new information on the year of construction of all wind farms built in Spain during 1985-2019. We have also compiled the details regarding the approval framework used in each region. We know whether municipalities have the power to require a business license or can block a project for incompatibility with the master plan. With this data, we perform several analyses. First, we quantify the effect of the location of a new wind farm on the vote in local elections for the parties of the mayor and the regional president. Second, we allow this electoral effect to depend on whether there is local veto power over the sitting of the project. Preliminary results suggest that when there is local veto power, wind farm projects harm the electoral prospects of the mayor. When there is no local veto power, wind farms	NA
2023	1970	PE05	Deliberation in Strategic Environments	In this online citizens’ assembly experiment, we study how citizens decide to act against climate change. Does deliberation help to process information, focus attention, or persuade individuals to change their pollution behaviour? Whether deliberation in citizens assemblies is effective in producing collective action seems to depend on context and set-up, which are rarely randomised. We suggest that contextual factors can induce strategic behaviour and therefore confound deliberative effects. Our goal is to test how citizens select policy alternatives in small assemblies, when some participants can deliberate in a virtual zoom room with or without being informed about an upcoming vote. We elicit current pollution behaviour to set strategic incentives in the experiment, to mimic the real costs of reducing individual pollution. We ask our participants, randomly assigned to small groups, to vote by plurality for the level of a fictional carbon tax proportional to their elicited carbon footprints, by electing one member of their group to select a final bundle. In a citizen-candidate framework, we model strategic entry, and test how deliberation affects entry, vote choice and policy outcomes.	NA
2023	659	PE05	From Cheap-Talk to Action: How Political Elites Respond to Environmental Demands	Do political elites respond to voters’ environmental demands? Addressing climate change is inherently a political challenge. While there is growing concern about the environment in public opinion, current policies will make reaching the Paris Agreement goals extremely unlikely at best. This paper studies the gap between mass preferences and policy-making by exploring the strategic behaviour of political elites. We focus on one actor who is most likely interested in responding: Green Parties. We provide a theoretical framework of different types of responsiveness: from talking on social media, to allocating candidates more in line with voters' preferences, to enacting actual policy. We study these different levels of responsiveness by combining geo-located data on Fridays for Future protests with novel datasets on the German Greens candidates' bios, speeches, and the policies they support. We use difference-in-differences and instrumental variable designs to identify this effect. We explore data on candidate selection and its regional variation, and data from other parties to understand how intra-party dynamics and ideology mechanisms influence our findings. This paper provides important insights for research on environmental politics and responsiveness.	NA
2023	1061	PE02	Who Governs Trade Associations?	Trade associations provide a crucial channel for the transmission of elite public opinion about the advisability of certain policies. They are also by reputation and according to observable metrics some of the most important and influential lobbying organizations. But whose interests do trade associations represent, and why, among their members? As Hart (2004) argues, business is not a monolith, nor even are businesses in one sector a monolith. By linking IRS non-profit tax records, data from the Encyclopedia of Associations, lobbying records filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and biographical information from BoardEx, we conduct a study inspired by Dahl's famous 'Who Governs?' to examine who governs US trade associations. We present the first systematic evidence on the backgrounds of board members of trade associations, examine turnover on their boards and evaluate the hypothesis that corporations may at times be able to capture associations and extend their political influence.

2023	1193	PE02	Investing in Politics: Private Equity and Coordinated Political Activity	Private equity (PE) firms have rapidly become some of the largest financiers in US politics. In this paper, we examine the role of coordinated corporate political activity in the private equity playbook for managing and retooling portfolio company acquisitions. First, we assemble a unique dataset of leveraged buyouts of US companies from 2008-2019. Using a doubly robust difference-in-differences estimator, we show that portfolio companies acquired by private equity subsequently increase their federal lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions. These effects are particularly large for companies that had stayed out of politics before the acquisition as well as those acquired by politically active PE firms. We also find evidence that PE managers coordinate lobbying strategy among their portfolio companies to improve cost effectiveness and narrow advocacy goals. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the PE industry’s financial performance owes not just to the financial and operational engineering, but also an optimization of political strategy to increase firm value.

2023	1738	PE02	Revolving doors in Spain (1920-2020)	The circulation of elites between the political and economic spheres has received increasing attention and sparked controversy in recent years. We provide the first systematic study of revolving doors in Spain and show how pervasive this phenomenon has been across time and regimes. We also explore the individual, institutional, and contextual factors that explain it. Our political elites include all the cabinet members, diputados, senadores, asambleístas, or procuradores since 1920. For economic elites, we have collected information every five years for the board members of the 200 biggest non-financial Spanish firms and all the Spanish banks and cajas de ahorros. Our novel dataset contains more than 42,000 observations (corresponding to more than 16,000 unique individuals) for board members of the largest non-financial companies. For financial organizations, we have more than 60,000 observations (around 17,500 unique individuals).	NA
2023	251	PE02	Foreign Lobbying in the US	Although the vast majority of countries maintain an embassy in Washington, DC, foreign governments spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to lobby US policymakers through US agents. We argue that lobbying mainly aims to facilitate communication between a foreign country and the US and the incentives for foreign governments to lobby US policymakers depend on the concurrence of significant events and the types of diplomatic channels available. We show that foreign government lobbying expenditures increase when elections take place in foreign countries during US ambassadorial vacancies. We also show that when US ambassadors are political apointees, lobbying expenditures to hire commercial lobbying firms decrease, but this effect is weakened under divided governmemnt in the US. Our results suggest that foreign lobbying can facilitate intergovernmental communication by reducing informational asymmetries when conventional bureaucratic and diplomatic channels are weakened.	NA
2023	449	PE02	Business Acumen or Political Connections? Estimating the Determinants of Entrepreneurial Intentions in Tunisia and Senegal.	While entrepreneurship is an oft-studied topic, most scholarship implicitly assumes that financial acumen and personal traits matter the most to successful entrepreneurs. However, we know that in countries where access to government institutions are elite-biased and where rule of law is selectively enforced, risk-taking and innovation may matter less than connections to influential politicians and officials. To better understand how elite bias in institutions may shape who becomes an entrepreneur, we conducted online panel surveys of college-educated young people in Tunisia and Senegal containing a conjoint experiment assessing who, in respondents' minds, would make a successful entrepreneur. We subsequently implemented field experiments recruiting from these panels that randomly offered entrepreneurship training combined with meetings with government officials who specialize in business-related regulation. Our survey evidence reveals that respondents believe connections to ruling parties and to government officials strongly influence the possibility of success in starting a business. Our preliminary results from field experiments suggest that these biases can be at least partially overcome by building positive relationships with local government officials.	NA

But we know very little about citizens' own lived experiences of mobility and how that affects their views on inequality and fairness. Using original survey data of over 3000 English respondents, we analyse how the educational, occupational, and wealth mobility from generation to generation shapes how citizens think about social mobility, intergenerational fairness, and inequality. We employ a survey experiment that primes citizens to think about the level of social mobility in their locality to see how information about geographical differences in mobility shapes attitudes and we also incorporate a conjoint experiment that asks citizens to compare policy sets with different geographical implications for 'levelling up'.

2023	1442	PE07	Central and Eastern European housing pathways: origins of differences	Central and Eastern Europe is often perceived in the political science literature as a region fundamentally shaped by its common state-socialist past. Although inter-country differences among welfare states in the region have received attention, housing as “the wobbly pillar of the welfare state” (Torgersen 1987) remains a field where such differences remain undertheorised and often explained solely by different policy choices made in the past few decades. Based on data encompassing developments in housing tenure and housing legislation of the 100 years, the research finds that some differences in the countries’ housing tenure structures and housing policies are rooted in policy choices made decades before state socialism was introduced in the region. The paper argues that different positions of (predecessor) states in the world economy, their housing legislation and the ideological basis of their housing policies in the first half of the twentieth century when housing policy was established are factors that have had an impact on the tenure structure and housing policies of CEE countries during and after state socialism.

2023	1875	1875	Electoral Constraints on Housing Affordability	A pervasive shortage of housing and rising rents has become a key challenge in many rich economies. The affordability crisis is in part the result of governments’ past decisions to stop building and investing in more public affordable housing. Why have governments constructed so little new public housing? In this paper, we argue that local politicians build less public housing because they face electoral backlash. We compile a novel dataset of all new housing constructed in Germany between 1996 and 2011 from the full-count housing census and combine it with data on municipal elections. We demonstrate that incumbents lose around four percentage-points when new public housing is constructed between elections, with left-wing parties as the main losers. We then provide evidence of potential mechanisms, including the role of property values and NIMBYism; perceptions of public housing being associated with low-income and immigrant groups; and fiscal dynamics. Our findings provide a new explanation for why public housing is underprovided and have implications for the construction of new public housing when electoral incentives for local politicians are misaligned.

2023	2008	CP13	What happens to renters? Discouragement and political action	Are we underestimating the political power of renters? I argue that as increasingly more people rent, this will fundamentally change how citizens and governments interact. Available research predominantly uses renters as the reference category for homeowners when analyzing political effects of ownership - but what about non-ownership? This paper analyzes the effect of an exogenous variation of interest rate hikes on access to homeownership. Increasing mortgage costs reduce trust in government as well as economic optimism for those individuals that are directly affected by a rising unaffordability of homeownership - the most typical form of private insurance - as citizens perceive the state’s failure to deliver access to this form of private insurance. By conducting a survey experiment in Germany and the UK, I evaluate the argument that as mortgages become more expensive, the experience of having been priced out of the market will translate into a higher willingness to take political action.

2023	403	PE07	Political Backlash Against Financialized Housing Markets	Cities worldwide are experiencing severe housing crises that generate inequality, economic hardship, and fear of displacement. Housing affordability and rising rents have triggered political demands for more public housing, rent controls, and even expropriation. A salient target of this backlash are institutional investors who have been buying up urban real estate and are seen as drivers of price hikes. We argue that this political backlash is not only about narrow economic self-interest such as rising rents and house prices; it reflects a fundamental rejection of “financialized capitalism” that turns housing as a shelter into a financial asset. To substantiate our argument, we first analyze the successful housing expropriation referendum held in Berlin in 2021 to examine how socio-economic and political characteristics of neighborhoods shape precinct-level referendum support. Second, we complement this analysis with original survey experimental data, demonstrating that discontent with financialized housing markets rather than mere price increases explains support for expropriation. Our findings imply that financialized capitalism can unify voters across traditional class and political cleavages and push them toward extreme policy demands.	NA
2023	1916	CP11	Soaking the rich in unequal states: Experimental evidence on tax preferences in Latin America	Citizens in highly unequal countries often do not express a strong desire to soak the rich through redistributive taxes, but there is little understanding of why that is the case. This ambivalence is especially puzzling in Latin America, where demand for progressive taxation has been persistently low following the return to democracy despite endemic inequality. Many scholars argue that this is due to low expectations of reciprocity, or the expectation of receiving state goods in exchange for taxation. We challenge this literature, as it makes strong assumptions about how individuals naturally make the trade-off between that the state ‘gives’ in benefits and what it ‘gets’ from tax revenue. We examine fiscal preferences using original conjoint experiments from Colombia and Mexico, which represent a closely controlled comparison between states with similar welfare provision and tax burdens but differ markedly in their tax structures. We then present an original, pre-registered survey experiment in Brazil, which indicates that considerations of benefits and the overall tax burden do not increase preferences for progressivity without an explicit linkage between taxation and welfare benefits.

2023	579	PE08	Policy Misperceptions, Information, and the Demand for Redistributive Tax Reform: Experimental Evidence from Latin America	Why do individuals' preferences for redistribution often diverge widely from their material self-interest? Using an original online survey experiment spanning eight countries and 12,000 respondents across Latin America, one of the most unequal regions in the world, we find significant evidence for an under-explored explanation: misconceptions regarding the distributional effects of current tax policy. Treated respondents who are informed that an increase in the Value-Added Tax (VAT) is regressive are significantly more likely to prefer policy reforms that make the tax more progressive. Treatment effects are driven by the large fraction of respondents who underestimate the regressivity of the VAT,even though their misperceptions are linked to fundamental views about the world. These respondents are disproportionately right-leaning and more likely to attribute success to individual effort than luck. Despite the deep-rooted nature of their misperceptions, treatment effects are largest among individuals who hold these views of the world. These findings contribute both to understanding the political economy of redistribution and the potential for information interventions to shift support for fiscal adjustment policies protecting the most vulnerable.

2023	629	PE08	Do Future Benefits Increase Political Support for the Social Security System? The Roles of Fiscal Risk, Time Discounting, and Risk Preferences.	Does realizing future benefits from redistribution increase support for the social security system? Based on the extant literature examining the relationship between people's future risk and preferences for redistribution, we hypothesize that realizing their own welfare benefits from government policies regardless of socioeconomic positions, such as current/future benefits from medical insurance, may increase support for redistribution; this effect, however, may cancel when people know their government fiscal unsustainability. To test them, we conduct an online survey experiment that randomly provides information that emphasizes the benefit of social security programs. The treatment group receives the correct amount of benefits an elderly receives from the medical insurance system. The treatment group is divided into sub-groups along whether to provide the information about their government’s fiscal unsustainability. On average, these treatments have no influence on their support for tax increase for medical insurance. Nevertheless, dividing the sample into those who are aware/unaware of the government fiscal risk, we confirm our hypothesis for the unaware respondents. Moreover, we found the heterogeneity of the treatment effects depending on time and risk preferences.	NA
2023	682	PE08	Better Call Bill? How individuals react to the philanthropy of the rich.	Philanthropy is one of the main characteristics that define the super-rich today. Some of the wealthiest individuals in the planet, like Zuckerberg and Bezos, have recently pledged to give away most of their assets. Although there is a growing literature about taxing the rich, the impact of the philanthropic behaviour of the rich on individuals’ preferences for taxing them has received very little attention. The aim of this paper is to come up with a theory about how the philanthropy of the rich can reduce individuals’ willingness to tax them. I argue that citizens might reward the rich for their giving for two different reasons: (i) for contributing to the common good through their donations and (ii) for signalling through their donations that they care about their community and that they are prosocial and generous. To test these theoretical expectations, I design a survey experiment where I provide individuals with information about the philanthropy of the rich.	NA
2023	967	PE08	Do Ut Des: How Tax Enforcement Engenders Pro-Social Behaviors	Do equitable institutions lead to a more equitable society? In this study, I argue that tax enforcement can strengthen pro-social norms and thus lead to changes in individual preferences and behaviors. I leverage three cases to test my argument. In the Italian and Slovakian contexts, I show that local enforcement leads to greater revealed preferences for social spending. As the horizontal equity of the municipal taxation increases, individuals reveal increased intrinsic demand for local social spending, electing more frequently to redirect 0.5% of their income tax from the national budget to social service expenditure in their municipality. This pattern illustrates how government action influences individual values, and that a better-functioning taxation system supports a more progressive society. In an additional case in Australia, I show that tax enforcement before a single-issue national election led to voting against the party championing a regressive tax reform. My evidence suggests that, across contexts, the horizontal fairness of the tax system contributes to pro-social norms.	NA
2023	1786	1786	Labor market risks and welfare preferences: a bounded rationality approach	This study introduces a bounded rationality approach to welfare preference formation under exposure to labor market risks. It expects argues that risk exposure only increases welfare demand when it is reasonable to assume that workers are aware of their risk exposure and when future-related concerns are currently salient. An empirical analysis of longitudinal data from Switzerland and 28 European countries supports the theory. Swiss workers only optimize their welfare preferences in a forward-looking manner when they become unemployed, and only the national unemployment rate is found to increase welfare demand in European countries. In contrast, a variety of risks on the occupational and individual level drawn from previous research are found to be unrelated with welfare preferences. The implication is that the risk exposure of employed workers may matter less for their welfare preferences and downstream political phenomena such as voting behavior than commonly expected.	NA
2023	266	PE09	Positional Income Competition, Salience of Immigration, and Support for Redistribution	This paper tackles the question of why the poor would be willing to pay the price of less redistribution in a context of ethno-cultural heterogeneity, even if they benefit from redistribution. I propose an argument whereby there is an extent to which people perceive differences in incomes between themselves and those poorer as justified, because they simultaneously reflect and confirm their own relative social status -- especially in a context of salient ethno-cultural heterogeneity due to immigration. This may then lead to willingness to sacrifice parts of ones' own material pay-offs to reduce those of the competition even more, i.e. be less supportive of redistribution. I test the implications of the argument using a 2x2 vignette survey experiment, where respondents were randomly allocated to either no vignette; information about their position in the income distribution relative to those poorer; information highlighting recent increases in immigration; or both of these two combined. In accordance with the theoretical expectations, the results suggest that exposure to the *combined* vignettes lead to lower expressed support for redistribution, especially among the lowest and the highest imcomes.

2023	654	PE09	Good Samaritan or Rich Samaritan?The Effect of Inequality, Development and Income on Preferences for Redistribution	When do people want redistribution? And when are people more divided over it? Previous studies have focused on the effects of income inequality, economic development and individuals’ household income, but mostly separately and with some mixed results. This article theorises and tests the interactive effects of these three factors. First, support for redistribution is proposed to increase when both development and inequality are high. While inequality increases the need for redistributive policies due to self-interest, development enhances people’s altruism by providing resources and state-capacity required for redistribution. Second, public opinion is expected to be more divided when both inequality and development are low. In these cases, the costs of redistribution go to a broader segment of the population and involve a larger share of their income. The analyses use multilevel models to estimate over-time effects with survey data consisting of 368,619 respondents in 281 surveys from 86 countries over three decades. The results support the hypotheses, showing that support for redistribution is higher in developed unequal countries, and that the differences are largest in less affluent equal countries.	NA
2023	660	PE09	Morality and Public Debt Preferences	Measures to reduce government debt through austerity are surprisingly popular among many voters, despite the immediate economic costs. However, we have an incomplete understanding of what drives voters to support these policies. In this paper, we examine whether citizens' moral attitudes toward private debt influence their preferences toward public debt policy. Given that private debt often invokes strong moral emotions rooted in religious beliefs, we argue that many people rely on their attitudes toward personal debt to evaluate the complicated macroeconomics of public debt policies. Using both observational and experimental survey data from Italy and Brazil (N=3000), we show that people's moral judgments about private debt repayment are strongly correlated with their attitudes towards public debt consolidation and repayment, even after controlling for other important factors. Additionally, we demonstrate that experimentally manipulating people's beliefs about whether defaulting on private debt is morally 'right' or 'wrong' also changes their attitudes towards public debt policy. Our research sheds light on the role of moral emotions in shaping public opinion on economic policy.	NA
2023	1163	PE10	Tax or Tap? Meeting Fiscal Needs in Zambia 2002-2020	How do politicians in sub-Saharan Africa achieve fiscal sustainability? Legislators can borrow externally or attempt domestic revenue mobilization. Much of the literature suggests that legislators are “chameleons” shifting rhetoric once in power to conform to clientelistic pressures, and adjust their spending and taxation with an eye to winning elections. To test these propositions, this paper draws on 16 years of Zambian parliamentary debate, comparing legislators’ rhetoric toward three sources of government finance: corporate taxes, payroll taxes, and external credit. We use dynamic word embeddings to compare rhetoric when politicians are and out of office, showing that preferences are strongly constrained by the fear of financial crisis, limiting the degree to which legislators can pursue any one of these strategies independently. Our paper contributes a new dataset including over 400,000 parliamentary speeches with covariates for legislator district, gender, and occupation. It also adds to the literature on policy autonomy in developing countries, demonstrating the conditions under which politicians attempt domestic revenue mobilization.	NA
2023	1188	PE10	Hands of my cheese: Parliamentary questions on geographical indications in the European Parliament	Geographical Indications (GI) like Feta are a form of intellectual property to identify goods that possess qualities or a reputation that are linked to their place of origin. While the protection is EU-wide, the benefits are reaped in the region of origin. This article takes an understudied political perspective on GIs, analysing the written questions that members of European Parliament (EP) pose. The aim is to discern patterns with respect to who is asking questions (nationality, ideology, and opposition status), the extent of territorial representation involved, and the content of questions (themes and products). By constructing a database of all GI-related questions in the EP between 2009-2019, we find that members of European Parliament show a strong focus on products from their region, which is consistent with a nascent literature showing national and regional representation in a transnational parliament. Secondly, conservative and regionalist/nationalist MEPs (in opposition status) countries ask most GI-related questions. Finally, many questions concern GIs in trade agreements, especially strongly politicized ones, suggesting that GIs may be used as another stick to beat unpopular trade agreements with.	NA
2023	1650	PE10	Political Discourse and Poverty: Studying Government Perceptions on Poverty in India	This paper seeks to study the relationship between political discourse and public policy related to poverty in India from 1947 to 2022. First, it uses qualitative and quantitative text analysis methods to study changes in parliamentary discourse related to poverty in the aforementioned time period. It studies prime ministerial speeches, question-answer sessions, and public speeches. Preliminary results suggest that there has been a change in the perception of poverty over time: while it was conceptualized as a problem to be solved through economic growth, employment and the provision of adequate foodgrains to people in the 1960s and1970s, this perception expanded to focus on rural development and investment in health and education as facets that were as important as economic growth and employment to address poverty in the early 2000s. Second, it conducts a similar text analysis using budgetary speeches, which contain information related to budgetary allocations and justifications, to find that a change in the perception of poverty in political discourse is strongly correlated with a change budget allocations and justifications. This provides insight into the policymaking process in India.	NA
2023	504	PE10	The effect of legislative misalignment on the representation of constituency interests	Legislators are subject to competing pressures from the principals they represent in parliament. How do legislators react when they learn that the priorities of their districts are misaligned with those of the party they represent? In this paper, we use the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies' leaning. This information shock allows us to study the causal effect of misalignment on political speechmaking. We find that MPs who learn that they represent principals with incongruent preferences (leave vs remain) significantly reduce their tendency to speak about the EU and Brexit, compared to MPs with congruent principals. Instead, they talk more about populist topics, such as crime and justice, and ‘the people’. They also cater more to their districts by speaking more about local issues and housing development. Our results show how legislators use populist topics as a tool to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between the legislature and the district.	NA
2023	1104	PE11	Perceptions of Deservingness among Elected Politicians	Which social groups do politicians perceive as powerful and deserving? Should these groups be treated differently by policy design? Building on literature about deservingness in social policy, we expect that politicians distinguish among social groups regarding their power and deservingness. For some groups, these classifications are more contentious. The deservingness heuristic also structures politicians’ response to policy design: considerations of benefits are expressed about deserving groups, whereas punitive measures are important for undeserving groups. The analysis is based on a field survey of over 500 elected representatives in Germany in 2021. Legislators judge the power and deservingness of six groups – asylum seekers, elderly, drug addicts, farmers, handicapped persons, investment bankers and unemployed – and then describe their policy choices on a subset of these groups in an open-ended interview. We leverage model based clustering for classifying assessments of power and deservingness and then use these classifiers for analyzing open-ended survey responses about policy design. The paper offers novel evidence on the power and privilege of some groups over others. These group differences are rooted in the variegated perceptions of elected representatives.	NA
2023	1922	PE20	Revolving Door Lobbyists: Evidence from the UK	The current literature has emphasized the costs and benefits of politicians going into the private sector for both the public and companies involved. The focus in studying this `revolving door' phenomenon has predominantly been on leaving political office for a career in the business world. In this article we focus on the reverse career trajectory: leaving private sector for a government job and its effects on the access of former employers to policy-makers. To study this process we use the data on UK MPs career paths and the meetings that took place between members of the cabinet and external organizations between 2010 and 2020. We document the changes in levels of access around the time of elections, when legislators with the history of private-sector employment enter or leave the political office.	NA
2023	250	PE11	Bureaucrats in Congress: Strategic Information Sharing in Policymaking	There exists a canonical power balance in policymaking between Congress and the bureaucracy. Information about policy implementation and its consequences has been theorized to be a determinant of who has a policymaking advantage: Congress or the bureaucracy. Given the critical role of information, what drives information sharing between bureaucrats and Congress? We argue that political incentives -- which underlie the type of bureaucrat or the partisan alignment between the executive agencies and Congress -- drive the amount and type of information that bureaucrats share with Congress in committee hearings. Using a new dataset that covers the federal agency affiliation, appointment type, and agency-level characteristics of each bureaucrat who testified in Congress from 1961-2018, as well as a new measure of analytical information present in witness testimonies, we examine who from the bureaucracy testifies in hearings and what information they provide. We find that the presence of divided government dominates as the main driver of the information exchange between bureaucrats and Congress.	NA
2023	341	PE11	Effects of Reelection Rates of the Introduction of Merit Civil Service Appointments in U.S. States	Access to patronage appointments is typically believed to confer an electoral advantage. Using a newly-assembled dataset of all persons elected to all U.S. state legislatures between 1900 and 2016, we study the effects of the introduction of merit civil service reform on reelection rates. Employing multiple new statistical methods appropriate for the staggered introduction of reform legislation, our results show that reelection rates significantly increase following the abolition of patronage appointments. We then show that one reason for the increase in reelection rates comes from increases in rates of rerunning by incumbents. We interrogate this with a discussion of why it might have occurred, and advance three hypotheses that could explain observed changes in political ambition.	NA
2023	428	PE11	Political Disclosure and Electoral Selection	How do political disclosure rules affect selection of citizens into public office, and how do citizens trade them off with other institutional arrangements, like wages or discretion in office? While disclosure rules are implemented in many countries to improve transparency and reduce corruption, we know little about popular preferences for these rules and their effect on who runs for office. In this paper, we offer the first cross-country experimental study on how different types of potential citizen candidates value and trade off costs and benefits of public office, and how this influences the quality of the candidate pool. First, we conduct a conjoint survey experiment across 10 developed and developing economies (N= 15 000), during which we elicit individual preferences for national disclosure regulation and lobby rules. Second, using a factorial experiment, we randomly vary hypothetical local office rules and study their effects on the desire of respondents to run for local office, and differentiate between socially and rent-seeking motivated candidates. Our findings have important implications for the research on political selection and transparency.	NA
2023	1330	PE12	The economic foundations of democratic legitimacy: Exploring the relationship of changes in macroeconomic inequality and trust in democratic institutions in Europe	With levels of populism, support for radical parties, and political alienation rising in parallel, the question arises whether economic inequality is the root of the political turmoil experienced in Western democracies.To date, empirical evidence has been mixed and is often based on cross-sectional studies employing different conceptualisations of macro-level inequality. We use survey data from the European Social Survey to explore the implications of changing levels of macroeconomic inequality for citizen’s political trust. We extend existing research by examining an expansive set of indicators to capture increasing economic polarisation, and we employ hybrid multilevel regression models to distinguish genuinely sociotropic effects of changing macroeconomic contexts from egocentric effects of citizens’ socio-economic status. We find that the inequality of market incomes is the primary factor to create repercussions at the level of the basic democratic order of societies even after controlling for national levels of economic prosperity and unemployment rates. Many other indicators of economic inequality, from rising poverty levels to rising top income shares may all constitute relevant policy issues, but do not call democratic fundamentals into question.

2023	415	PE12	Benevolent Dictatorship: Historical Force or Unicorn?	We analyze the concept of “benevolent dictatorship” and how it has been used in public and scholarly debate. We further specify the concept, centering around the two core dimensions of dictators’ other-regarding preferences and their ability to process information to properly tie policies to goals. We discuss why we expect benevolent dictators to be rare, empirically. We also detail observable implications, and especially how we can distinguish “benevolent dictators” from other types of authoritarian leaders who, in some contexts, have incentives to act similarly to benevolent dictators. Our subsequent empirical analysis, drawing on several thousand heads of state or government since 1789, suggests that there have been very few benevolent dictators throughout modern history. The lack of consistency in “good performance” across policy areas and over extended periods of time, for almost all autocratic leaders, is hard to square with “benevolent dictatorship”. Finally, we discuss academic and policy implications from our argument and findings, stressing the importance of making realistic assessments about autocrats' motivations and how this influences our ability to form more precise expectations about dictators’ future behavior.

2023	787	PE12	A Theory of Favor Exchange between Politicians and Rich Media Owners	This paper presents a formal model of a favor exchange system between the president and the rich media owners, who are minority in the society. The president offers favors like bribes, state advertising revenues, and low tax rate to the rich media owners and takes in return skewed media coverage that increases his popularity and assists him in winning the elections. A system like this emerges, on the initiative of the president, when his popularity is low to ensure his political survival. A forward-looking popular president refrains from this decision, since the favor exchange system would constitute a powerful tool in the hands of his political opponent in future elections, when the former will hold the opposition role.

2023	90	PE12	Carousels of Democracy: The Long-Term Effect of Electoral Alternations On People’s Attitudes About Democracy	How do you know a democracy when you see one? A common narrative is that citizens take democracy for granted until they experience (the threat of) a dictatorship. In this paper, we challenge this pessimistic view and argue that they do experience it during moments of electoral alternations, i.e., when elections turn the incumbent out of power. Starting from the premise that democracy is indeed a political system in which parties lose elections, we examine the downstream effects of government turnovers on people’s democratic support. To do so, we analyze a unique dataset gathering 1.5 million respondents surveyed globally over 50 years to which we match more than 100 years of electoral data. Cross-section results reveal that each additional electoral turnover elevates support for democracy, leading to a positive cumulative impact over one’s life cycle. We then leverage close elections and discontinuities around the voting age to identify the unique causal effect of turnovers and test the mechanism behind this effect.	NA
2023	1250	PE25	Taxing Nazi Wealth: How History Affects Attitudes towards Redistribution	Wealth inheritance is a major contributor to growing economic inequalities. While such transfers are often regarded to violate ideas about meritocracy, we know surprisingly little about how the historical origins of wealth affect people's attitudes towards wealth redistribution. We argue that illegitimately acquired wealth is widely regarded as undeserved, even after it has been passed on through generations. We test our argument in the context of family companies in Germany, many of whom have amassed considerable fortunes while collaborating with the Nazi regime. Results from a web-based vignette study (n=2002) show that respondents regard such 'Nazi wealth' as less deserved than other inherited wealth and are more supportive of its redistribution. Remedial measures by the companies can ameliorate this effect. By highlighting the importance of history, our findings add important nuance to our understanding of the politics of wealth inequality.

2023	2042	2042	Mind and machine: rooting out corrupt politicians	Corruption is pervasive across the world, yet voters keep electing corrupt politicians. One common explanation is that voters simply lack information on whether candidates are corrupt, yet studies that deliberately provide such information find electoral accountability is weak at best or non-existent at worst. So can we root out corrupt politicians? We approach the problem taking a different approach: rather than disclosing corruption itself we explore what kind of readily available information allows voters to identify and not vote for corrupt politicians. Based on a dataset of politicians in Colombia, we use a novel approach: first, we employ machine learning techniques to identify political and personal characteristics that are predictive of corrupt practices. We then design an experiment that randomises the provision of this information to evaluate what candidate information enables voters to discriminate corrupt from non-corrupt politicians. Our study aims to contribute to the policy push for greater information disclosure about candidates for public office by refining exactly what information leads to better voter choices.	NA
2023	377	PE13	Political Campaigning, and Racial Discrimination in Arrests for Drugs	In this paper we show that political campaigning can influence the behavior of lawenforcement officers. We follow monthly arrests for 1383 police agencies in 40 AmericanStates from January 1984 to December 1990. During these years the Presidents of theUnited States developed a strong rhetoric against drug abuse. The main target ofthe presidential rhetoric was crack cocaine, a drug that the media associated withBlacks. We implement a difference in differences approach to test if exposure to the presidential rhetoric affected the behavior of law enforcement officers. We find that arrests for crack cocaine of Blacks increased more in counties more exposed to the presidential rhetoric against drug abuse, while we find no effect for Whites. We use machine learning techniques to construct a novel measure of the intensity of the presidential rhetoric against drug abuse, based on Regan's and Bush sr.'s public papers. We then use this new measure to validate the findings of our DD model. We find that Regan’s political rallies had a similar effect.	NA
2023	472	PE13	The Political Economy of Assassinations	Assassinations of politicians are prevalent in many developing countries. This study argues that corruption is a causal determinant of political assassinations. Politicians use assassinations as a way of enforcing their corrupt agreements with other politicians. To test this argument, I develop a novel dataset on political assassinations in Brazil. More specifically, I identify the universe of all assassinated municipal politicians by linking data on over 10 million homicides over the past two decades to a registry of all political candidates. Using these data, I exploit randomized anti-corruption audits, which have been shown to reduce subsequent corruption in audited municipalities. Consistent with the theory, I find that politicians are less likely to be assassinated in audited municipalities, and these effects are amplified when larger government revenues render it more worthwhile to engage in this form of costly punishment. These findings suggest that beyond various other consequences, corruption may foster political violence, with important consequences for democracy and development.	NA
2023	497	PE13	Are Female Politicians Attacked More than Males, and Why? Evidence from Italian Municipal Elections	Studies have highlighted an increase in attacks against elected officials. However, little is known about the motives of these attacks, whether they are perpetrated by individuals or organized groups, and which politicians are most likely to be their victims. This paper asks whether women pay a higher penalty than their male colleagues. Leveraging a unique database of attacks against Italian politicians, we document that attacks double when women are marginally elected for office, and that aggressions are equally perpetrated by individuals and criminal groups. We also investigate to what extent attacks are driven by pure discrimination or different policy choices. Women are more likely to be victims of aggression when they spend more on social projects, in particular on immigration. The gender wedge in attacks is however not fully explained by policy differences, indicating that discrimination, or other perceptions of female leaders, are partly responsible for their higher victimization rate. Our findings underscore the importance of activating protection systems for public officials and offer hope that better security measures could reduce gender gaps in political representation at the top.

2023	1601	BO055	Financial Exclusion and Voting Behavior in Spain	Fostered by growing regional inequalities, the voting behavior literature is starting to expand the study of economic inequalities to disparities in access to public services. While previous studies focused on the provision of public services with clear links to political and state actors, the present paper examines the closure of bank branches in Spain, a public-private service not directly provided by the government. These closures decreased financial accessibility in many rural and periurban areas. Moreover, by facilitating the privatization of the banking industry and injecting public money to rescue banks, this process bred protests throughout Spain, where mainstream parties are perceived as the main political actors responsible for this phenomenon. Preliminary results from DiD models show that bank branch closures fostered anti-mainstream party vote, mainly for 2011-2015, characterized by widespread protests and an ongoing fragmentation of the party system. Simultaneously, the closure of bank branches does not seem to affect voting turnout, even in the long term. The findings help us understand the links between the privatization processes taking place under globalization and their effects on changing electoral landscapes.	NA
2023	1938	PE16	Economic Shocks and Changing Political Representation. Are Labor Unions the Missing Link?	The dramatic rise in import competition from developing countries since the 1990s has given new urgency to explain political responses in the United States and other advanced economies. Recent scholarship has cataloged many reduced-form effects of trade shocks. Far less attention has been paid to the problem of unbundling the causal paths through which economic shocks affects political responses. In this paper, we assess the possibility that an important part of the political effect works through local labor unions that shape the relative strength of workers in the policymaking process. We study the US House of Representatives using a recently developed semi-parametric mediation model. The model operates by leveraging two distinct sources of exogenous variation: an instrument for import competition and a novel instrument for district-level union membership based on history and geography. We find that import competition lowers district-level unionization and that weaker unions lead to less legislative responsiveness. The union channel represents a large fraction of the treatment effect of import exposure on legislative votes.	NA
2023	1988	PE28	Employee Hardship Funds as Private Welfare	Americans have seen years of stagnating wages while also bearing more economic risk. Past generations of workers joined together for mutual aid and political agitation to address such grievances. But precarious employment, fissuring workplaces, and distributed supply chains make it harder to build the necessary occupational identities and dense networks of co-workers. How will workers and firms respond? I exploit a widespread but largely unstudied set of firm-specific, employer-driven income support programs, ``employee hardship funds'' (EHFs). Echoing mutual aid funds from an earlier era, EHFs raise money in the form of donations from workers themselves and provides cash grants to a firm’s own workers when they face unforeseen emergencies. I document the prevalence of EHFs, including among 9 of the 10 largest American retailers. I use a novel matched worker-employer survey at two large firms to discover whether such privately provided 'welfare' matters to workers, improves financial well-being, and affects workplace solidarity and politically relevant attitudes: support for unions and for the welfare state.

2023	318	PE16	Addressing Gig Workers as Voters: Analysing the Salience and Rhetoric of an Economic Niche Issue in Current Party Manifestos Across Europe	The gig economy is a very recent phenomenon in Europe. Even though it is growing rapidly, it still accounts for only 1-3% of employment across Europe. Consequently, it is valid to ask why parties should develop a policy position on this economic niche topic. The paper aims to analyse: (1) if the gig economy is taken up by the entire ideological party spectrum; (2) in which countries it does (not) play a role in party competition; and (3) which argumentative strategies different parties/party families use. Therefore, classical theories of party competition are combined with the niche issue literature to investigate whether argumentative patterns from previous niche issues can be transferred to the gig economy. The article draws on the parties’ most recent manifestos to perform quantitative text analyses. The sample comprises all parties from more than 20 European countries with at least one seat in the national parliament. Preliminary findings show that the gig economy is addressed in about 30% of manifestos, that parties from the entire ideological spectrum engage in the discussion and that national contexts matter.

2023	655	PE16	Correcting Inaccurate Perceptions about Material Consequences of Unionization Increases Popular Support for Organized Labor	Why do workers not take more action to improve their working conditions in the face of rising inequality? Focusing on unionization, we argue that misperceptions about the benefits and costs of unionization prevent workers from taking action. In a representative study, we show that there are many Americans who have misperceptions about the material consequences of unionization and that there is a relationship between holding misperceptions and support for unions. Using a survey experiment, we correct workers’ misperceptions about the costs and benefits of unions and test whether doing so increases support for unionization. The results indicate that correcting misperceptions leads to a large increase in support for unions. We find that these effects run through a direct and indirect mechanism. First, voters update their priors about what unions could do for them and therefore support them more. Second, voters update their priors about the capabilities they and others like them have to improve their own working conditions (political efficacy), leading to increased support. Our study helps us understand aggregate support for unions in advanced democracies.	NA
2023	1118	PE18	Automation, Culture, and Vote Choice	How does revolutionary technological change translate into the political arena? Over the last two decades, we have seen an important restructuring of employment relationships in post-industrial societies, and technological change is widely considered one of the main drivers of these transformations. The emerging literature in political economy has shown that exposure to automation makes individuals more likely to support radical right parties. However, the extant works have not yet identified the mechanisms linking exposure to automation and political behavior. In this paper, I explore the potential mechanisms, focusing on the interplay between economic and cultural factors. Using mediation analysis and survey data from the European Social Survey (2012-2016) for thirteen European countries, I present evidence that outgroup threat and nostalgic sentiments mediate the effects of technological change on support for radical right parties and political disengagement. I then complement the analysis with a survey experiment with a parallel design encouragement applied in the US. My findings have important implications for understanding the links between structural change in labor markets, cultural backlash, and political inequality.	NA
2023	1368	PE18	The effect of skill strategies in the context of technological change. Do training policies prevent that workers are being left behind during the transition towards the knowledge economy?	An important characteristic of the knowledge society is routine-biased technological change which has deepened the divide between routine workers and college graduates. Given the decline of traditional labour market institutions, such as labour unions, the idea that inclusive access to training policies can prevent that these routine workers (“the losers of technological change”) are being left behind has become popular among academics and policy makers alike. However, little is known on whether these skill strategies achieve their goal of making technological change and therefore the transition to the knowledge economy more inclusive. Therefore, I ask the following question: Can life-long learning policies moderate the impact of technological change on employment opportunities of routine workers? I use a novel identification strategy for public training infrastructure by exploiting data on the geographical distribution of training providers in Denmark which I match with employment data from the Danish registers. This enables me to study whether in firms, which have better local access to training providers, routine workers are less likely to experience downward mobility.	NA
2023	1375	BO055	Can firms shape the political outcomes of technological change? An analysis of the employers' contribution to the rise of far-right parties based on linked employer-employee data.	It is a well-established finding that technological change has caused frustration among negatively affected workers and therefore contributed to the political success of far-right parties. However, workers within the same occupation experience technological change differently depending on how firms manage technological change. Understanding the firm as an actor with agency opens the possibility that despite occupational status losses at a national level, inclusive production strategies can prevent that workers feel left-behind in their existing employment relationships. This suggests that firms have a role to play in shaping the extent to which job polarisation because of technological change ultimately leads to political polarisation which would be novel contribution to the existing literature. Therefore, I ask the following question: Can firm-level production strategies moderate the effect of working in occupations negatively affected by technological change on far-right voting? To test the argument, I analyse a linked employer-employee version of the German SOEP panel study which provides data the inclusiveness of firm-level production strategies. I further use the well-established routine task intensity index to operationalise technological change at the occupational level.	NA
2023	1765	BO055	The Threat of Automation and Public Support for Environmental Policy	Automation, the replacement of human labor by machines, has transformed economies around the world over the last decades with broad political and social consequences. In this paper, we argue that the automation risk also affects individuals' environmental concern and subsequent policy support. The long-term economic risk posed by automation is expected to reduce environmental concern amongst those affected, due to a deprioritisation of long-term issues that also necessitate economic transformation. Automation risk subsequently leads to individuals being less concerned about the environment and less supportive of costly environmental policy. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) from 2002 to 2018 for 23 European countries, we find individuals more exposed to technological change are less likely to hold environmental concerns. Moreover, using causal mediation analysis with data from the eight wave of the ESS, we explore how exposure to automation affect support for environmental policies. Our findings have important implications for understanding how structural transformations in the economy shape individuals' preferences for tackling long-term societal problems like climate change.

2023	610	PE18	Robots Replacing Trade Unions: Novel Data and Evidence from Western Europe	Economic distress and individual exposure to automation have emerged as significant determinants of the increasing success of populist and radical-right parties and candidates in advanced democracies. However, the debate on why such technologically-driven economic grievances have expressed a decidedly right-wing character and not favored pro-redistribution, and traditional left-wing, parties is still unsettled. Historically, labor unions have played a crucial role in liberal democracies by hindering the increasing wage inequality, by channeling political demands and discontent into an organized voice. However, the importance and effectiveness of unions in the democratic process have progressively diminished in the last decades, combined with an atomization of political demands. We suggest that technological change, and robotization in particular, have directly contributed to weakening the role of unions. We employ novel granular data, at the subnational and sector level, on union density in Western Europe over two decades, to estimate the impact of industrial robot adoption on unionization rates. Furthermore, we shed new light on the mechanism by which regions and individuals more exposed to automation tilt towards nationalist, isolationist, and radical right parties.	NA
2023	1060	PE21	How to reduce bureaucratic corruption? Unpacking Brazilian anti-corruption audits	Under which conditions do anti-corruption policies reduce bureaucratic corruption? Previous studies find that anti-corruption audits are effective in disciplining politicians, but their impact on bureaucrats is unclear. We leverage 13 years of randomized audits and the careers of 1.1 million Brazilian municipal officials. We find that audits cause a multi-pronged response: increasing dismissals and departures, slowing career progression, and leading to a spike in hires. Bureaucrats that are over-paid relative to their private-sector wages, non-tenured, and co-partisans of the mayor face a higher risk of dismissal, suggesting that audits lead to a removal of likely bad apples in the bureaucracy. Finally, the effect of audits is consistent with electoral accountability, with stronger responses in municipalities where mayors are in their first term, particularly in the first year of their term. We develop a formal model that rationalizes those findings, taking into account the strategic interactions between politicians and bureaucrats when engaging in corruption, as well as strategic punishment of bureaucrats by politicians.

2023	1597	PE17	Government, Interrupted: Impeachments, Partisan Alignment and the Local Bureaucracy	This paper develops and tests a theory of how local politicians respond to national political crises, conditioned by their partisan alignment with the government in peril. Local politicians that belong to the incumbent’s coalition will spend relatively more than politicians that are partisan-unaligned with the government. I test the theory by leveraging the Peruvian political crises between 2017 and 2020 using a rich, monthly dataset on district municipalities’ spending. I apply a difference-in-differences design that uses the constitutional fact that election cycles of local mayors are independent of national election cycles. I find that municipalities, where mayors share the same party affiliation as the President, spend 11% more during political crises, especially on discretionary budget lines. This finding would suggest that, even in contexts with weak parties, important cross-level political dynamics can lead to inefficient spending decisions.	NA
2023	2039	PE21	Political Connections and Financial Allocation: A Conjoint Experiment with Loan Officers in China	Do political connections affect financial resource allocation? This is a substantively important question without an easy answer. It is difficult to make inferences using observational data, as often done in the literature. Most important, firms with managers personally connected to political elites also tend to be state-owned enterprises (SOEs), i.e., institutionally connected to the state, so it is hard to tell which type of connection matters. This study addresses the inferential challenge through a simple conjoint survey experiment with Chinese loan officers. I find (1), contrary to the conventional wisdom, local SOEs in China do not have any institutional advantage vis-à-vis private firms in accessing cheaper bank loan, but the advantage kicks in when the state tightens credit control; (2) the advantage gets bigger monotonically as the strength of the institutional connection gets stronger; (3) firm managers’ personal political connections also matter independently; and finally, (4) political connections, whether personal or institutional, do not wash away the importance of firms’ economic fundamentals in accessing bank resources. This paper contributes to our understanding of the micro-foundations of economic resource allocation.	NA
2023	652	PE21	Between enforcement and forbearance: the compliance effects of deferring payment of public utilities	How can resource-stripped governments ensure access to public utilities in ways that are economically and politically viable? Nonpayment of basic services is widespread and enforcement is difficult to implement in many middle-income economies. We focus on a conceptually novel and empirically understudied response to non-compliance: deferred payment of bills. By targeting non-poor, formal sector users, deferred payment of bills has the potential to sustain formal consumption in volatile economies, but may lower perceptions of enforcement. Using observational and experimental data, we evaluate the compliance effects of a policy of deferred payment of electricity bills implemented in Uruguay under the Covid19 crisis. A difference in difference analysis shows that the policy substantially increased compliance. Using information nudges targeted to beneficiaries, we provide evidence of the mechanisms through a RCT implemented in cooperation with the local energy provider. Intent to treat effects indicate a moderate increase in payment in response to the information nudges. Finally, we provide experimental evidence on the effects of the policy among non-beneficiaries. Our work has important implications for the political economy of informality in developing countries.	NA
2023	888	PE21	Authoritarian Surveillance and Public Support for Digital Governance Solutions	What factors determine support for digital governance solutions? And do autocracies differ from democracies in the way the population evaluates digitization initiatives by the state? Building on previous studies, we hypothesize that gaps in the quality of public services and information asymmetry between the government and the population increase support, while exposure to information about the potential abuse of such tools by the state reduces support. We conducted a survey experiment with 2462 respondents in Russia and complemented it with four survey experiments of 1000 respondents each in Germany, Turkey, the United States and Estonia. We find strong and consistent evidence that knowledge about the potential misuse of digital governance solutions reduces support, irrespective of the type of political regime. Citizens who mostly rely on government-controlled information are more likely to support the introduction of digital governance tools. Contrary to previous studies, we do not find that gaps in the quality of public services increase support. Instead, respondents who are satisfied with the services provided by the state also seem to trust the government with introducing a digital governance solution.	NA
2023	1785	PE22	The electoral consequences of taxation	This study analyzes whether government parties face electoral consequences after overseeing changes to taxation. It presents a stylized theoretical model that illustrates the conditions under which electoral consequences should occur. Based on the assumption that taxation is unpopular, it can be expected that governments are rewarded for tax cuts and punished for tax increases; and based on the assumption that taxes are popular among supports of pro-redistribution parties on the left, it can also be expected that left parties rather reap electoral rewards for tax hikes and suffer losses for tax cuts. These expectations are tested with data on the electoral fates of government parties in OECD countries over 45 years. The empirical analysis covers the development of personal income and VAT tax rates as well as the adoption of tax reforms in the legislature during government parties’ incumbencies. The results show that increases to personal income taxes is punished at the subsequent election, with some evidence also pointing towards electoral rewards following personal income tax and VAT decreases.

2023	1986	PL04	The Macroeconomic Condition and Junior Coalition Partners' Electoral Strategies	The privilege to govern is a driving force for parties in parliamentary democracies. Yet, joining the government as a junior partner can be electorally costly. On average, due to their relative policy invisibility, junior coalition partners lose more votes than the prime minister's party. This is made worse when the economy performs well, as voters mainly credit the latter for economic boom. This suggests that junior partners are electorally disadvantaged under macroeconomic boom, as voters’ crediting of the prime minister’s party overshadow these parties’ policy accomplishments. This paper focuses on junior partners' electoral strategies under economic boom. I argue that under an improving economy, junior partners without responsibility for the finance portfolio should distinguish themselves from the prime minister's party. They should pay greater attention than the latter does on non-macroeconomic policy issues, i.e. attention differentiation, with the goal of maximizing voter support. Results from statistical analyses support my hypotheses and suggest that in a good economy, attention differentiation is electorally effective for junior partners. They also hint at the potential link between growth and issue diversity in elections.	NA
2023	2005	PE22	The Electoral Costs of Reforming Political Institutions	Biased political institutions can privilege one party over others, helping to assure that party’s future electoral success. Reforms of political institutions often require little more than a bare majority of votes in a country’s legislature. Yet political parties, who directly or through their coalition often control a majority of votes and could benefit from implementing biased reforms, frequently abstain from making reforms. How do we explain their forbearance? We argue and elaborate a formal model that shows that citizens punish politicians for any sort of reform in issue areas where citizens believe that politicians are biased and citizens are not perfectly informed about reform quality. Drawing on a survey experiment, we then evaluate the model using the proposed electoral reforms in Germany. We show that citizens become less supportive of the opposition and the opposition’s proposed electoral reform, when they are informed that the opposition is supportive of the reform. This pattern is consistent with citizens learning – from the attribution to the opposition party – that the reform is likely to be biased and punishing the politicians accordingly.	NA
2023	313	PE22	Delegation and Recruitment in Organizations:The Slippery Slope to Authoritarian and IneptLeadership	We construct a dynamic model of two-sided sorting in labor markets with multi-dimensional agent and firm heterogeneity. We apply it to study optimal party structure on the decision of how (de)centralized candidate recruitment should be. Parties compete at the local markets over recruitment of candidates and local organizers possess an informational advantage over the distribution of politicians' skill, which is positively related to rent generation. Party leadership has a dual objective: they want simultaneously to: a) maximize the organization's rents (e.g., electoral returns); b) maximize their retention probability. Thus they face the following trade-off in deciding how centralized recruitment is; delegating candidate selection to local party organizations might increase the party’s electoral returns but also limits a leader's ability to stack-up the organization with loyalists. We characterize the equilibrium delegation rule which has two key properties: a) high-skilled politicians select into lower-performing parties due to ideological alignment and, b) more extreme and incompetent leaders delegate less, and as a result, survive longer at the helm. Thus, our findings highlight the slippery slope of decentralization.	NA
2023	1620	PE23	Associational Endowments: How Parties Survive the Lowering of the Electoral Threshold	How do parties survive the lowering of the electoral threshold when they are barred from state resources? This paper proposes one mechanism that focuses on 19th century party building efforts in states with diverse societies and high-levels of voter disenfranchisement. I conceptualize a mechanism -- Associational Endowments, by which parties managed to create voter-party linkages in the absence of free and fair elections through civil associations. During the 19th and 20th century, emergent political parties organized outside parliaments in civil society; Socialist, Catholic, Protestant, ethnic, and agrarian parties, provided material (and non-material) goods and services to the disenfranchised population through their brick-and-mortar institutions. This paper shows (1) where associations where built during the long process of democratization, (2) what the associations did and for whom, and finally (3) the relationship between a party's Associational Endowment and the likelihood of it's survival into the democratic party system. To show evidence in support of the mechanism, I collected, digitized, and coded archival data for over 18,000 civil associations from the Hungarian Kingdom (1848-1945).	NA
2023	314	PE23	Shadowless Theocracies	To what extent do conservative culture and institutions affect political preferences and support for gender equality in the long term? In every Italian election with a running Catholic party, two regions, separated by the Po river, showed marked differences in their Catholic votes (above 20 p.p.). They also voted differently in referenda on divorce and abortion (1974, 1981). I exploit the discontinuity generated by the river to disentangle the effects of conservative formal institutions (the theocratic Papal States), and conservative culture (Medieval patriarchal norms) on voting outcomes. For several centuries, the region north of the river displayed conservative culture but progressive institutions, while the other had a progressive culture and was only partially subject to conservative institutions. Using a novel Difference-in-Geographic Discontinuities (DIG) estimator, I find that conservative institutions have no effect on Catholic votes. The entire difference in votes is attributable to culture, through its effect on social capital.	NA
2023	330	CP08	Elite Identity and Local Development in Colonial Ireland	We study the long-run consequences of the identity of localelites for political and economic development. Between 1652-9,approximately a third of Ireland’s land was expropriated fromIrish Catholic elites and redistributed to English Protestants.Leveraging the lottery-based assignment of baronies to differentclaimant groups, we show this exogenously predicts the shareof land redistributed to Protestant elites without affecting thelocal concentration of land ownership. Drawing on a rich setof data sources, we find that (1) this variation persisted for twocenturies; (2) areas more intensively redistributed to Protestantelites became more rural and more dependent on small-scaleagriculture over time. We provide evidence consistent withthese areas being worse affected during the Great Famine of1845-9.	NA
2023	445	PE23	Did Immigration Undermine Popular Support for Welfare Expansion? Historical Evidence from Swiss Referendum Votes (1890-1992)	Different historical experiences with immigration have been said to explain different patterns of welfare state development between Europe and the United States: while high immigration in the US lowered support for redistribution and hindered the emergence of an encompassing social safety net, homogeneity and low immigration in Europe allowed for more encompassing redistributive policies. Yet, existing literature does not provide a direct measurement of welfare support in the phase of development of the welfare state, and of how it could have been affected by immigration. In this article, we use results of Swiss referendum votes covering a hundred years of welfare expansion (1890-1992) to investigate the relationship between the percentage of immigrants and support for welfare expansion in the formative phase of the welfare state. Matching data on the percentage of immigrants at the subnational level with local referendum results on the expansion of different welfare programs (health, pensions, unemployment), we find no evidence that a higher proportion of immigrants is associated with lower levels of support for welfare expansion.

2023	853	PE23	Indirect rule and the colonial origins of religious cleavages	This project studies the legacy of colonialism on post-independence religious divisions. Through the practice of indirect rule, the British Empire relied on local agents to control the territory. Indirect rule often reshaped or institutionalized power relations at the local level, by legitimizing groups seeking hegemony over minorities. In a context where local political conflict between colonizers’ backed elites and minorities overlapped with religious boundaries, conversion to Christianity may have become a vehicle to articulate claims and coordinate against authorities, leaving a legacy of persistent and politicized religious identities. I address this question in the context of colonial Nigeria, where the Northern provinces overlapped with the territory of a pre-colonial Islamic state. I study the effects of assignment of ethnic groups to Muslim colonial authorities on Christian identification and political attitudes today, and the effects of mission penetration inside pre-colonial borders on religious mixing and episodes of conflict in the post-independence period. To this purpose, I use geo-referenced data on the distribution of European missions and contemporary surveys, and geographic regression discontinuities at Nigerian pre-colonial and colonial administrative boundaries.

2023	160	PE24	The Origins of Direct Rule: Evidence from the Qing Empire	As alternative institutions of governance, indirect and direct rule have different implications for the costs and benefits of governing a territory. We argue when the economic benefits provided by the peripheral regions to the central state are minimal, indirect rule would be favored as it helps to minimize the cost of ruling. When the perceived benefits associated with the resources extraction increases, however, rulers are tempted to establish direct rule. We construct a panel dataset to examine the effect of an exogenous price shock on the Qing rulers’ extension of direct rule into the formerly indirectly-ruled southwestern provinces. We find native chiefdoms endowed with copper were more likely to adopt direct rule in times of rising international copper prices. To avoid military confrontation, the Qing state preyed only upon the civilian chiefs, while leaving the military ones untouched, as the latter was appointed to provide social order. Our findings survive several alternative explanations of state building, and go beyond historical China to shed light on other cases where central power balanced their need to extract rents and deter rebellion.

2023	1882	PE24	The Train Wrecks of Modernization: Railway Construction and National (Dis)Integration in Europe	Many view nationalist ideologies and national identities across Europe as the outgrowth of economic, social, and political modernization in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Yet, there are few spatio-temporally disaggregated tests of the relationship between modernization processes and nationalism. More importantly, it is theoretically unclear whether modernization led to national cohesion and stabilized Europe’s multi-ethnic states or whether it destabilized them by fueling non-state nationalisms and separatist mobilization. In this paper, we use the gradual expansion of the European railway network 1816-1945 to investigate how this key technological driver of modernization affected ethnic separatism. Combining new historical data on ethnic settlement areas, conflict, and railway construction, we test how railroads affected independence claims, separatist conflict, and successful secession among non-core ethnic groups. Difference-in-differences and event study models show that railway-based modernization increased separatist mobilization and secession. Separatist responses to railway access concentrate in countries with small core groups and weak state capacity as well as in large and economically disadvantaged non-core groups. Overall, our findings caution against a simplistic understanding of the effects of European modernization.	NA
2023	962	PE19	Checks and balances and nation building: the Spanish Constitutional Court and Catalonia	We examine whether judicial review can affect political attitudes by studying how the ruling of the Spanish Constitutional Court on the Catalan Constitution affected Catalan support for secession, which doubled in the 2010-2012 period. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the ruling occurred amid a public opinion survey. We find that the ruling led to a 20% increase in support for Catalan independence from Spain in 2010. The ruling exacerbated the preferences for decentralization, up to secession, and ignited a backlash against institutions. Additionally, the polarization of political attitudes depended on endogenous identification: the ruling strengthened Catalan identity and increased political polarization in that dimension between people with and without Catalan heritage. Polarization around this issue came at the expense of depolarization in the economic dimension.	NA

In this paper, we look at Thailand’s railroad projects in the late-19th and early 20th centuries as an example of a state’s strategic response to colonial encroachment. By transporting government officials and establishing a permanent administrative presence, the railways served to ensure Thailand’s sovereignty over peripheral regions and bring them under direct governance. These regions, long considered economically unviable and disconnected from Bangkok, gained rail access due to their strategic importance and in turn witnessed urbanization and increased agricultural production.

2023	1092	PE25	Adio Kerida: Demographic Engineering of the Economic Elite Through Taxation	Most research on demographic engineering in diverse societies focuses on physically violent policies that the political elite pursue toward non-core groups, from population exchange and expulsion to ethnic cleansing and genocide. Although taxation is at the core of the governing elite's policy toolbox to pursue political goals, little research has examined how discriminatory economic policies, such as identity taxes, can alter the ethnoreligious composition of the economic elite. Using a differences-in-differences design, we leverage the wealth tax of 1942 in Turkey that was disproportionately levied on non-Muslim minorities (Jews, Greeks, Armenians) to identify and measure the demographic impact of a discriminatory tax policy relying on an original dataset that covers individuals and businesses in Istanbul's telephone directories between 1934 and 1947. We find that the extraordinary wealth tax significantly decreased the ethnic diversity of the economic elite and helped nationalize the economy. By demonstrating that destructive tax policies can be used for demographic engineering, this article emphasizes the power of economic discrimination in altering the ethnoreligious composition of the rich in diverse societies.

2023	568	PE25	Labor Emancipation and Exclusionary Property Rights in Imperial Brazil	Canonical views emphasize scarcity and state strength as explanations of private property rights. These conditions were absent in some postcolonial societies, and yet well-defined property rights were codified. I advance a theory that underscores exogenous changes to labor institutions as drivers of property rights formation. I argue that the abolition of labor-repressive arrangements, such as slavery or the slave trade, encourages landed elites to delineate private property rights as a means to exclude free workers from accessing cultivable land and reduce the cost of labor. I use a multi-method strategy to test this argument in Imperial Brazil, where a ban on the Atlantic slave trade pushed planters to support the Land Law of 1850 to prevent immigrants from claiming land and hinder the rise of a commercial smallholder class. This paper shows how landed elites exploited a hallmark of private property to maintain their privileges: the right to exclude others	NA
2023	639	PE25	Bank Failures and Elite’s Democratic Consent: An Exploration with Individual Data	Do economic shocks influence elites’ democratic attitudes and commitment? Elites play a crucial role in shaping democratization processes and their consent is oftentimes thought of as a necessary condition to consolidate democratic political institutions. Elites’ economic interests, the perception of an economic threat or the types of assets in their hands are crucial to explain when and why elites accept democracy and commit to democratic procedures. Yet, this theory has never been tested at the micro-level with individual data. To do so, we exploit data on individual-level economic losses following the failure of a large bank in Catalonia in the 1930s. We then match these bank depositors with their individual turnout behavior using roll calls for a set of elections in which right-wing parties had different electoral strategies. We specially focus on the divergence taking place in the last elections before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, when part of the right-wing boycotted the elections, making it possible to interpret turnout as de facto support for the democratic regime.

2023	672	PE24	Justices of the Peace: Legal Foundations of the Industrial Revolution	Longstanding debates in development economics and historical political economy have been concerned with the role of the state in supporting economic development. A leading view is that legal capacity - the ability of a state to enforce its laws - plays a key role. But exactly how is legal capacity developed? What are its longer-term effects within economies? We study how local legal capacity developed in England and Wales immediately prior to the Industrial Revolution. The monarchy long relied on local magistrates, known as Justices of the Peace (JPs), to enforce property rights and administer market regulation, but JPs increased in number and influence during the political turmoil of the 1600s. We show that counties with more JPs in 1700 experienced more economic growth - proxied by population density - over the following 140 years. Higher JP numbers are also associated with more industrial development, and greater investment in local infrastructure. Using the stock of local elites as an instrument for JPs strengthens the causal interpretation of our results.	NA
2023	753	PE14	Religious Minorities and Public Service Provision: Evidence from 19th and early 20th Century Egypt	Why do ethno-religious minorities succeed at providing extensive public services? Evidence in political economy suggests that ethno-religious diversity undermines public service provision. We argue instead that competition across ethno-religious groups can enhance non-state public service provision by minorities, if they face an existentialist threat. Egyptian Coptic Christian elites engaged in rapid development of modern schooling in the 19th and early 20th century as a backlash to missionaries’ efforts to convert their followers. Employing original dataset of modern Egyptian schools (1825 – 1913), we show that competition created by American missionaries, that held the most contentious conversion program, caused a rise in the provision of Coptic schools, and that had almost double the effect size in comparison with other missionary groups. We employ an instrumented difference-in-difference design, we exploit the Egyptian Khedive's decision in 1878 to recognize Protestantism as a formal religious sect, and the geographic variation in Copt population share. We demonstrate that competition initiated through the surge in American missionary schools in areas with a high share of Copts, led to a significant increase of Coptic modern schools, post 1878.	NA
2023	1534	PE26	The invention of mass politics: the enfranchisement-rebellion dilemma	According to classical theories, elites extend voting rights to the broader population to avert mass rebellions. We argue that these accounts do not consider the direct effect that granting broader political rights can have on increased political engagement not only through peaceful, but also through violent means. We investigate this unexplored channel in the context of 19th-century France. During the July Monarchy (1830-1848), suffrage levels in communal elections varied quasi-experimentally according to population cutoffs. Higher levels of municipal suffrage before 1848 increased turnout in national elections after 1848 held under universal male franchise, and they also saw more individuals arrested for participating in the 1851 insurgency. The expansion of the franchise can temporarily undermine the basis for mass rebellions, but it creates a politically more active citizenry able to pose a greater threat of rebellion in the future.	NA
2023	178	PE26	The Modern Origins of Political Contestation	Research concerning the selection of political representatives often assumes a contest---i.e., a situation in which more candidates compete for a seat in a representative institution than there are seats available and at least one candidate loses. Despite the importance of electoral contestation to classic conceptualizations of democracy, the historical origin of this institution is not well understood. In this paper, I consider the origin of contests in early modern England. I provide the first systematic documentation of the pattern of contest emergence over the long 17th century. Then, using newly-collected data on the universe of candidate selections---including their date, location and the characteristics of both returned MPs and their so-called challengers---I systematically evaluate competing theoretical accounts of their emergence, including those predicated on group cleavages, as well as those centered on eroding norms of consensuality. I find that eroding norms did not initially provoke contestation; instead, extant norms were superceded by socio-political interests reflecting an emergent cleavage between increasingly independent local power in opposition to traditional aristocratic power. These findings reflect the importance of economic autonomy in early institutional development.	NA
2023	1888	PE26	Does Industrialization Cause Democratization? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the Norwegian Industrial Revolution	Recent work has shown that a large share of employment in manufacturing (i.e., indus-trialization) is strongly correlated with democracy, even after accounting for countryand time fixed effects, time trends, and a wide range of plausible control variables.In this paper we exploit a unique quasi-experiment in 19th- and early 20th-centuryNorway that allows us to examine whether this correlation between industrializationand democratization is causal. Using novel roll-call data from the Norwegian nationalparliament we study whether MPs that represented more rapidly industrializing dis-tricts were more likely to vote for suffrage extensions over the 1891 to 1906 period. Forcausal identification we exploit that Norwegian districts with a greater geographicalpotential for hydropower generation were significantly more likely to industrialize afterthe nationwide introduction of hydroelectricity in 1892. Preliminary results suggestthat industrialization did cause democratization in Norway.	NA
2023	735	PE26	Elite-Led Democratization: The Dutch Experience in the Late Nineteenth Century	The familiar theory of democratization emphasizes the “redistributive threat” democracy poses to the elites. In contrast, this paper highlights the role of Dutch dukes and barons who set up the first national, professional party organizations to successfully challenge the independent liberals that had dominated Parliament since 1848. Realizing their strong position among the disenfranchised, the Antirevolutionaries would outflank even some Liberal factions in their drive to expand suffrage during the 1880s and 1890s. I supplement prior qualitative, historical research with analyses of a panel dataset on all candidates that stood for election between 1848 and 1918, coupled with highly detailed electoral and demographic statistics of Dutch municipalities, to provide evidence for the link between conservative party organization and democratization. These findings suggest a role for robust conservative party organizations in peaceful transitions to democracy, contradicting the canonical view that democratization results primarily from a revolutionary threat of the masses.

We document that voters who voted for exiting candidates are more likely to change their voting behavior in the subsequent election than the other voters. However, candidate exit explains only a fairly small part of the changes in the voting behavior over time within individual voters. This indicates that for quite a few voters the partisan ties were stronger than have been previously thought in this candidate-centered system with weak parties. We uncover three large voter groups: Loyalist Conservatives and loyalist Liberals who do not change party in general nor in response to candidate exit, and a volatile group who changes voting behavior both in general and more so in response to changes in the choice set.

2023	1028	PE27	Breaking Away: Evidence on Dynamic Secession from the U.S. Civil War	What propels secession? Are strategic interactions between multiple regions within a nation state important? We consider the canonical case of the secession of southern U.S. states in the 1860s where multiple regions explored secession and use novel hand-collected daily sub-sovereign bond data from the NYSE to understand the dynamic process of secession. We show that, after the election of President Lincoln in the fall of 1860, markets priced the risk of secession into southern and border states -- long before war broke out between the Confederacy and the North. Further, secession risk decreased as the number of states seceding increased, suggesting that markets reassessed the viability of the Confederacy based on the strategic decisions of states to join the movement. Moreover, consistent with a model where more homogeneous preferences make the outside option more attractive, financial markets viewed secession as less risky when it was validated by a popular vote rather than only a vote by subset of leaders.

2023	1441	PE27	Allies of the Weak: La Résistance and Jews in the Holocaust	Did the presence of anti-Nazi resisters help or hinder Jews’ survival in the Holocaust? Resistance movements across occupied Europe have been typically accused of not having helped their fellow Jewish citizens escape from genocide. In addition, a common view in political science holds that insurgents’ presence attracts more state violence. In contrast to this, I use multiple archival collections on WWI and WWII military personnel, Holocaust victims’ records, and testimonies of survivors and rescuers to show that insurgent presence in fact decreased local numbers of Holocaust victims. To ensure that the relationship is causal, I use an instrumental variable exploiting the exogenous number of WWI military deaths, which increased insurgent recruitment in WWII. Case studies of mechanisms reveal that the insurgents helped the Jews by using tactics they had developed to fight the incumbent. By studying a three-way relationship between the genocide targets, insurgents and the state, this article provides unexpected and quantifiable evidence about the most notorious genocide to-date.	NA
2023	507	PE27	Conservative elites, political identities, and mobilization: evidence from the Spanish civil war	What leads people to take arms in civil conflict? We argue that, when their hegemony is threatened, local elites use patronage networks and the salience of political identities to mobilize their constituencies, first at the ballot box and then in armed conflict. We study the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and the pro-Franco uprising in the province of Navarre, a stronghold of rural conservatism, promoted by the traditionalist Carlist movement. We identify the roots of Carlist mobilization capacity in the countryside using newly digitized data on agrarian reforms in the early 19th century, and on combatants in the first Carlist war (1833-1840). We then measure the influence of Carlism on mobilization using individual-level archival data on electoral participation (1931-1936) and on the universe of Navarrese pro-Franco insurgents in 1936. We further study the role of elites influence and external threats to traditionalist identity on mobilization, with novel data on the partisan composition of municipal councils, local electoral competition, and affiliation to competing political identities, such as socialism and Basque nationalism. This project sheds light on the sociopolitical dynamics of interwar fascism.	NA
2023	54	PE17	When are Junctures Critical? The Legacies and Non-Legacies of Interruptions in Local Self-Government	Interruptions in local self-government are a common feature of both external imperial rule and centralized authoritarianism. Due to their similarities, the literature on historical legacies has considered both kinds of interruptions as potentially legacy-producing. But under which specific circumstances do these denials of local political autonomy actually lead to sustained changes in political behavior? We develop a novel framework that elucidates when interruptions in local self-rule will produce political legacies, and when they will fail to do so. Two factors are crucial: the duration of interruption and the scope of repression. Enduring interruptions characterized by encompassing repression are the most likely to generate persistent changes. Contrariwise, transient interruptions characterized by limited repressiveness are unlikely to produce legacies. Given our theory's broad character, we conduct empirical analyses in two markedly different settings: Poland, which was split between three major empires, and Brazil, where a military regime externally installed appointed mayors in a large number of cities. Our results demonstrate that interruptions in local self-government have varying potential to create legacies.	NA
2023	901	PE01	The Roots of Democratic Attitudes: The Effects of Historical State Presence	Several authors have identified a persistent – though time-varying – impact of past events on current political attitudes. In our paper, we focus on citizens’ perception of state legitimacy, and willingness to abide to the very laws it produces (Lowes et al 2017). We study the case of Spain combining original, individual panel survey fielded right before the outburst of Covid-19 with historical data. We investigate whether the pandemic – suddenly increasing the visibility of the state presence– spurred conflictual responses from citizens more prone to reject the authority, regardless of their ideological stance, finding suggestive evidence corroborating this hypothesis. Specifically, we use province-level variation in the deployment of police officers (Guardia Civil), state sponsored schools and land inequality to proxy historical state presence by the late XIX century and early XX century. We match this historical data with the contemporaneous tracking of a representative sample of Spanish voters with survey panel data in which we asked for individual technocratic preferences before and after the pandemic outbreak. We document how historical state presence affects indivudals’ changes in technocratic preferences during the pandemic crisis.	NA
2023	1151	BO01	For Richer or For Poorer, Polarisation Affects Us All: Analysing the Role of Economic Hardship in Shaping Affective Polarisation in Europe	Since the 2008 financial and European debt crisis, many European citizens have become increasingly distrustful towards politics. Concurrently, US polarisation literature showed that people perceive politics in affective rather than ideological terms, coining the term affective polarisation – the difference between positive bias towards in-group members and negative bias towards out-group members. Affective polarisation has repeatedly been linked to problematic consequences, such as democratic dysfunction. As its causes remain understudied in Europe, this paper explores whether individuals suffering from economic hardship are more affectively polarised. By experiencing negative emotions and a lack of self-esteem, individuals are theorised to emphasise group identity to recuperate status, which strengthens social distance towards out-group members. While financial and job insecurity literature tends to focus on objective measures, this paper also considers people’s perceptions of these insecurities. Moreover, it will test for the moderating effects of personality traits, such as neuroticism and narcissism. The empirical analysis relies on novel nationally representative data collected in 11 European countries (N = 14.000). Different measures of affective polarisation will be analysed, such as thermometer and social distance scales.	NA
2023	1792	EU01	Populism and Affective Polarization as Threats to Liberal Democracy: Evidence from European Democracies	Across Europe and other parts of the world, populist parties have grown in number and support over the past few decades. This current wave of populism across Europe has affected a wider swath of countries than ever before and has raised concerns about its consequences for democratic stability and backsliding. However, there have been very few empirical studies to test how and to what degree populism affects level of liberal democracy. Using both the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and Varieties of Party (V-Party) datasets, I conduct a cross-national observational study across 35 European countries over three decades (1994-2019) to analyze how and if populists in government, populists in the opposition, and general populist party presence affect the level of liberal democracy in a country. Additionally, I argue there is a key piece to this relationship that scholars have previously overlooked: affective polarization —partisans’ feelings of distrust, contempt, and dislike toward political opponents. I argue that affective polarization mediates the relationship between populism and democratic backsliding.	NA
2023	718	BO01	Ideological Identities as Sources of Affective Polarization	Political identities in many countries in Europe centre around political ideologies: people see themselves as Left or Right, and they dislike others if they are on the opposite ideological side. Often, these divisions are based on ideological identification, so that ideologies form the basis of social groups. However, even though the importance of ideological identification has long been recognized, research on affective polarization has so far largely ignored it. In this paper, we remedy this by adapting the design presented in Orr and Huber (2021) and Diaz and Lelkes (2022) to account for ideology in addition to partisan and policy issues. In addition, we include political involvement as a further characteristic (Krupnikov and Ryan 2021). Using this design, we test (a) the influence of ideological identities on inter-voter affect, (b) whether it remains relevant when accounting for other voter characteristics, i.e. partisanship, policy beliefs and involvement and (c) whether partisanship remains a relevant source of intra-voter affect once ideological identities are controlled for. We field our survey in Germany, a medium-size party system with long-lasting partisan and ideological identities.	NA
2023	726	BO01	The Limits of Brexit Identity Prejudice	More voters in the UK now identify as Leaver or Remainer than with one of its political parties, a division that cuts across party lines several years after the EU referendum. Do these new political identities generate prejudice as deep as party identities? To answer these questions, we employ an experimental paradigm to test a set of hypotheses derived from a typology of prejudice developed by Allport (1954). The first study was conducted in 2019 (N=912), three years after the Brexit referendum. We find that Brexit identity prejudice is at least as intense as partisan prejudice, including on democratic norm violations. The second study tests the same hypotheses with equivalent online experiments in the Spring of 2023. We discuss the findings in light of the debate on the disruptive role of affective polarisation and how its behavioural implications cause problems for the functioning of liberal democracies.	NA
2023	809	BO01	Transformation of the political space: A citizens’ perspective	A growing body of research draws attention to the rising salience of socio-cultural issues and, potentially, the emergence of a new political cleavage. However, the micro foundations of this transformation are less well understood. Here we take a voter-perspective to evaluate how party competition has been restructured in the eyes of the voter by leveraging measures of citizens’ self-reported propensities to vote for alternative parties (PTV) in the EES surveys from 1999 to 2019. Our analysis provides evidence of a substantial shift in voter assessment from party competition structured on the economic left-right dimension to the GAL-TAN dimension. We also find great separation of radical right parties from other parties, with the deepest antipathy between the radical right and greens.	NA
2023	1351	BO02	Identity stability in the face of unfortunate events: A Twitter study	In this paper, we show how self-identifications on social media stay stable, even in the face of identity-threatening events. We analyze 2.6 million English-language Twitter profiles to show two results. First, there appear to be almost no events that lead to noticeable changes in the number of people identifying with broad identity categories (e.g. 'journalist'', 'Christian''). We show this via unsupervised modeling of all the content in Twitter users' self-descriptions---automatically summarizing all identity-related words into 80 meaningful identities. Second, we investigate whether very significant negative events might lead to disavowal of specific identities whose status is threatened by the event (for instance, Catholic identity and Canadian school mass grave discoveries). We find that de-identification is an extremely rare response to negative events. In follow-up analyses, we plan to investigate whether status-threatened group members instead defend their identity through tweets.	NA
2023	1503	BO02	Liberal value conflicts and religious discrimination	Recent research has demonstrated that contemporary democratic societies have moved towards more inclusion among liberal democratic countries (Ivarsflaten and Sniderman 2022). Nevertheless, while societies have moved towards more inclusion, there is also more hostility directed towards Muslim minorities. One answer to this puzzle can be found in the conflict of liberal democratic values. Currently, existing work have mainly considered the juxtaposition of gender equality and minority rights. This paper goes beyond the question of gender equality and turns the focus towards a particular value conflict, namely that of child-rearing values. Through a series of survey experiments this paper demonstrates that there are large differences in the majority population’s willingness to include Muslim minorities. The results show that when Muslim minorities want to preach conservative child-rearing values, their democratic rights are completely rejected, while the rights of a Christian group preaching the same values are not. Using follow-up open-ended responses this paper further demonstrates the core differences in people’s perceptions and the reasons leading to religious discrimination.	NA
2023	1678	BO02	Territorial Affective Polarization: Concept, Measurement, and Prevalence	Federations and decentralized countries divide their geography and people into autonomous territorial units. These units are different in a number of dimensions and the historical development of these asymmetries shape the territorial coexistence in these regimes. In fact, by building communities of individuals with a sense of belonging to their unit, and a set of positive and negative feelings towards the rest, inter-unit sympathies and low profile rivalries are a defining feature of these countries. Yet, a rival unit may turn into an out-group when its members persistently prompt negative emotions and sentiments among the members of an in-group unit. We define as Territorial Affective Polarization the extent to which citizens like people living in their unit more than people living in the rest of the territories. Moreover, we argue and empirically demonstrate that this ’affect gap’ might become a threat for the functioning of a decentralized democracy once these like-dislike dynamics become politicized. Specifically, we contend that TAP might present corrosive effects when individual level ideology and the level of affect for the inhabitants of other territorial units align.	NA
2023	707	BO02	Identity Alignment in Campaigning: Field experimental evidence from Germany	According to research in political psychology, shared in-group identities can increase support for an in-group political candidate. Thus, identity-aligned messages should convince voters to support the in-group candidate. However, most research focuses on a single identity rather than the various identities.In addition, the impacts of identity alignment are often investigated in laboratory or survey settings. In this field experiment, we collaborated with a state representative running for re-election in Germany for a state election in May 2022. We use postcards to recruit participants for the experiment integrated into the three-wave panel study. We randomly allocate whether voters receive both direct and indirect contact on their doorstep and a handwritten postcard from the candidate. We also assign whether the postcard content stresses candidates' identities. Our findings show that interaction with the candidate positively influences the candidate’s name recognition and favorability. Additionally, emphasizing her identities on postcards boosts her recognition, favorability, and vote share. However, the effect was not more pronounced among those who share her critical identities, nor did we find any supporting evidence of our treatment on party-level evaluations.	NA
2023	824	BO02	From 'Us' and 'Them' to 'We': Reducing Territorial Affective Polarizationin Spain	This paper shows that the extent to which individuals perceive themselves as exemplary of their in-group moderates the effect of extending in-group favouritism towards out-group members via priming an inclusive superordinate category where the originals sub-groups can be nested. I test this argument in the Spanish regions of Madrid and Catalonia through an online experiment where treated individuals are exposed to information that highlights the role of the societies of Madrid and Catalonia in the high rates of blood donation of Spain. I find that exposure to the treatment induces the reduction of negative attitudes towards out-group members without changing perceptions concerning the in-group category. These results updates our knowledge on how can social recategorization reduce affective polarization and prove that it can be applied in settings where groups are polarized on the dimension of territoriality or nationalist attachment rather thanalong partisan lines.

2023	1385	PP10	Effective Long-Term or Low-Cost Short-Term Environmentalism? Insights from choice experiments on carbon removal policy	Most high-income countries struggle to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions fast enough. This has led to rapidly increasing interest in carbon removal approaches. The key issue here is that quasi-permanent, and thus highly effective carbon removal from the atmosphere is expensive, whereas less durable removal approaches, like reforestation, are cheaper. We examine how citizens, whose opinion drives climate policy choices and whose policy preferences are commonly presumed to be myopic, form preferences towards effective long-term versus low-cost short-term environmentalism. Our study design relies on choice experiments in two high-income European democracies (Switzerland, UK, N=3000 each). The randomly manipulated policy attributes in the experiment cover cost, durability of carbon removal, leakage risk, and implementation mode (gradual vs. full). We expect that long-term effectiveness of carbon removal increases public acceptance if uncertainty about the policy’s future effectiveness is low. For this reason, individuals with more trust in public institutions are also more likely to opt for policy designs that favour long-term effectiveness of carbon removal (durability) over costs, implicating a higher willingness to pay for effective long-term approaches to carbon removal.	NA
2023	1476	BO03	Experimental evidence on the link between individual carbon emissions and environmental policy support	Individuals with high socioeconomic status are substantial contributors to carbon emissions while at the same time being over-proportionally environmentally conscious. Drawing on the notion that both environmental concern and carbon emissions increase with affluence, this study investigates whether high carbon emitters alter their support for ambitious environmental policies when primed with their revealed environmental impact. Going beyond dominant theoretical explanations such as the low-cost hypothesis or moral licensing, we assess how policy support changes if environmentally concerned citizens, who either ignore or are unaware of the negative impact of their behaviors, are primed with the respective information. We analyze changes in a rich set of environment-related policy preferences based on an experimental design implemented in a high-quality, population-representative panel survey in Switzerland (N=6000). Through an individualized information prime on personal carbon emissions, we resolve the rationale behind dominant theoretical explanations for the observed attitude-behavior gap by providing respondents with the supposedly absent or suppressed information. In particular, we measure within-subject changes in support of different environmental policies that vary in cost intensity, incorporating a voluntary, market-based or command-and-control approach.

2023	1600	BO03	Norwegians underestimate support for meat reduction for environmental concerns	Notable reductions in the consumption of animal-based foods in high-income societies is important to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, but new policies concerning meat reduction can seem hard to implement. However, the evidence presented in this paper suggest that this opposition may be overestimated. The study presents novel evidence from a coordinated online-survey among samples of both ordinary citizens, local elected representatives and public administrators in Norway. The results show both what citizens, politicians and bureaucrats themselves think about a specific proposal for meat reduction, as well as each group's perception of public opinion about the same specific proposal. The results are in line with recent studies estimating perceptual accuracy that find a tendency to overcompensate for own opinion when assessing public opinion. Such misperceptions of public opinion are unfortunate for the public debate, and for the adoption and implementation of new policies.	NA
2023	661	BO03	Public Preferences on Sustainable Global Supply Chains - Experimental Evidence from Developing Democracies	Costly economic consequences of sustainability governance throughout the global economy are likely to materialize in developing economies of the Global South. However, public demand for environmental and social public goods is commonly presumed to increase only after negative externalities have peaked at medium income levels. Accordingly, contemporary unilateral global supply chains policies imposed by governments in the Global North may be misaligned with the economic and political priorities of citizens in developing countries. Extending recent research on global supply chains policy preferences within the Global North, we conduct an analysis of citizen preferences in the Global South. We implemented survey-embedded experiments in Brazil, India and Indonesia – three large developing, democratic economies (N=2,000 each). We find that citizens of these three countries, on average, support information disclosure requirements for firms as well as provisions allowing governments to sanction non-compliance. We further explore between-country variation in policy preferences, perceptions of policy benefits and costs, and interactions with key individual attitudinal and ideological priors. Our results indicate that sustainability policy preference formation in developing contexts deviates from common theoretical expectations.	NA
2023	719	PC09	Social tipping our way - or maybe not - to some kind of future	How can a social planner use an intervention to disrupt the status quo and activate sweeping social change? When conformity and coordination incentives hold, such an intervention operates through at least two channels. It has a direct effect if some people exposed to the intervention change behavior as a result. It also has an indirect effect if some people change behavior because they observe others doing so. If the indirect effect is large, it dramatically amplifies the direct effect, a possibility that has generated considerable enthusiasm in policy discussions. That said, mundane forms of heterogeneity introduce a number of challenges. Using a mix of models, observational studies, and experimental results, I argue three points. First, some forms of heterogeneity strongly interfere with social change simply because they favor chronic disagreement. Second, even when sweeping social change is feasible, the social planner should typically expect a trade-off between the direct and indirect effects of her intervention. Increasing one effect means decreasing the other, and social planners may often lack the information they need to resolve the trade-off effectively.	NA
2023	2	BO04	Norms, and Personal Beliefs about Racism among Black and White Democrats	We examine the relationship between partisan identity and beliefs about racism, and how it is conditioned by racialized identity. Specifically, we look at personal beliefs among Black Democrats across four different conceptualizations of racism —explicit, subtle, institutional, and colorblind—, and their perception of the normative expectations of their partisan and American identities. We also compare these personal beliefs and normative expectations to those of White Democrats. Our findings suggest that Black and White Democrats agree on the norms of their partisan and American identities, but Black Democrats are more likely to express personal beliefs that are consistent with those normative expectations regarding institutional racism. This is because White Democrats are more likely to violate the group norms by disagreeing that situations which represent institutional racism are indeed instances of racism. Through a norm priming experiment, we find that White Democrats are more likely to express personal beliefs that are consistent with partisan norms regarding subtle racism, institutional and colorblind racism when primed to think about those norms. This is only true among Black Democrats for subtle racism.	NA
2023	373	BO04	Parasocial exposure to successful immigrants and attitudes toward immigration	Can exposure to successful immigrants in the mass media affect perceptions of immigrants and alter attitudes toward immigration? To address this question, I study the case of Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, the co-developers of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and children of Turkish immigrants in Germany. I first demonstrate that German media favorably highlighted the Turkish roots and migration history of vaccine developers. Leveraging the quasi-experimental setting with the announcement of the success of the vaccine, I then posit that the wide broadcasting of the vaccine's success and its developers' identity should have positive spillover effects on public attitudes towards immigration. Amongst those who were exposed to this announcement, compared to those who were not, I find a 4 percentage point increase in support of easing immigration opportunities. I suggest that this effect is driven by a change in perceptions of self-awareness on issues relating to immigration and integration. These findings imply that positive media framing and highlighting successful integration can be key to social cohesion in host societies.	NA
2023	50	BO04	Immigrants' Personalities Strongly Affect Natives' Immigrant Preferences in the UK	We examine the impact of immigrants’ personality on natives' attitudes towards these immigrants in a novel, preregistered conjoint experiment in Britain. We randomly assigned personality descriptors from the Big Five Aspects Scales (BFAS), a well-validated personality inventory that splits up each of the Big Five into two aspects, to fictitious immigrant profiles. Our findings are threefold: First, we show that immigrants’ personalities which signal a greater willingness to integrate culturally, namely high politeness (part of Agreeableness), low volatility (part of Neuroticism) and high orderliness (part of Conscientiousness), have a strong causal effect on natives’ propensities to admit such immigrants into the UK. Second, we find similar effects for immigrants with personalities that signal greater economic potential, namely high industriousness (part Conscientiousness), enthusiasm (part of Extraversion), and intellect (part of Openness to Experience). Third, we find that, with the notable exception of openness (part of Openness to Experience), immigrants’ and natives’ personality congruence does not play a role in natives’ evaluations. Rather, natives scoring high in socially desirable traits disproportionately punish immigrants who do not possess such qualities.	NA
2023	859	BO04	Immigration and Deportation Attitudes in the United States and Brazil	This project examines a topic that has received limited attention in existing scholarly work on immigration attitudes, but that is central to the political discourse of various countries: the deportation of undocumented immigrants. What determines attitudes toward deportation? We focus on two countries where immigration is a key political issue and where populist right-wing politicians have been successful in recent years: the U.S. and Brazil. We ask what role economic contributions have in driving deportation attitudes and whether interventions describing an immigrant’s experience can reduce support for deportation. We study these questions with original survey experiments conducted in the U.S. and Brazil with representative samples. In our first experiment, we find that when respondents are exposed to a story describing the economic contributions of a hard-working immigrant in the host country, they are substantially less likely to support the deportation of undocumented immigrants. The importance of economic contributions to counteract support for deportation is confirmed in our second experiment: the share of respondents who oppose deportation increases significantly for different undocumented immigrant profiles when they are presented as entrepreneurs.

2023	913	BO04	The dangers of legitimation: how the presence of an RRP in parliament can increase antiimmigration attitudes	Are citizens hiding their true preferences? The entry of nativist and nationalist radical right parties can help normalize certain attitudes considered taboo among the population. This paper argues that the presence of an RPP in parliament has a legitimation effect that allows citizens to declare their antiimmigration attitudes, previously hidden. I test this argument using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology, examining whether the population expresses more negative attitudes towards immigration after the entry of Vox, a Spanish RRP, in the Andalusian Regional Parliament in 2018. Results show a strong positive relationship between Vox’s entry in parliament and people’s proclivity of expressing negative attitudes towards immigrants of the Andalusian population immediately after the election, compared to citizens from other regions of Spain. However, this effect does not hold in the long term. This article has important implications for our understanding of attitude normalization and RRP effects on society.	NA
2023	1198	BO05	Affective polarization, partisan violence, and social context: The battleground of North Carolina	With one in two U.S. citizens convinced that civil war will break out in the next decade, understanding partisan political violence takes on urgency. This paper seeks to explain the conditions under which direct and indirect social ties fuel a person’s propensity to engage in political violence. We draw on an original survey-embedded experiment fielded in North Carolina, a key battleground state in US presidential elections with high levels of affective polarization. A random subset of participants in our study are primed for their peer group's willingness to engage in partisan political violence. We assess how such primes affect a) their attitudes on the legitimacy of political violence; b) their willingness to provide passive support for partisan violence; and c) their behavioral willingness to share partisan pro-violence content online.

2023	368	BO05	Intergroup Conflict, Aggression and Preferences for Dominant Leaders: Evidence from a Panel-Based Experiment among Ukrainians after the 2022 Russian Invasion	Dominant alpha-type leaders who lead through fear and intimidation constitute a widespread phenomenon now as well as historically. Still, the psychological mechanisms underlying citizens’ support for dominant leaders remains a puzzle. One prominent theoretical account for why citizens come to support dominant leaders holds that intergroup conflict and aggressive emotional reactions to intergroup conflicts cause citizens to steer their leader preferences in direction of dominance. Despite its centrality in existing work, this theoretical model remains untested in direct connection to intense and ongoing intergroup conflicts in the real world. This study leverages a two-wave panel survey with 1,081 representative (753 re-interviewed) Ukrainian participants conducted during the first month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 to conduct an ecologically valid test of whether followers exhibit stronger support for dominant leaders during intergroup conflict. Results support the intergroup conflict-dominant leadership connection and, furthermore, panel analyses show that followers enhance their preferences for dominant leadership the more they experience aggressive emotions.

2023	426	BO05	Shaken, not stirred: The effects of political violence on election outcomes	What are the effects of political violence on election outcomes? Scholarly attention has focused on the causes and consequences of violence in developing countries, however much less work has centered on political violence in consolidated democracies. By creating fear and insecurity among the electorate, violence can reduce participation and prevent voters from making informed decisions. Less is known about its effects on the evaluations of the incumbent, especially in coalition government settings, and even less so of radical parties. To investigate this question, we rely on a novel dataset of political violence from Greece during the snap parliamentary elections of May and June 2012. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we test causal effects of political violence on turnout and vote choice at the vote-center level in two major Greek cities, Athens and Thessaloniki. We find strong positive effects of political violence on voter turnout, and strong negative results on the vote for the incumbent socialists and the radical left. Vote for the conservatives and the communist party increases in precincts with geographic proximity to violent events between the two elections.	NA
2023	880	BO05	The Persistent Effect of State Political Violence on Support for Autocracy: Evidence from Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design on Fascist Italy	What is the persistent effect of state political repression on support for autocracy? In this paper, I trace the permanent effects of repression against civilians on their support for autocracy. A growing literature shows that autocracies repress citizens and social organizations by psychological, digital or physical means imposing legitimacy and stability. Drawing on evidence from an historical case in Turin, Italy, I show how state political violence against civilians results in persistent decrease of support for autocracy, even when a regime change takes place. I first gather qualitative new data by reviewing over 500 newspaper articles on protests and repressions in Turin between 1867 and 1922. Second, I implement automated webscraping approach on state archives to over 89,000 previously classified individual-level data on National Fascist Party members. To empirically test this claim, I implement spatial regression discontinuity designs and show that areas exposed to state political repression during the monarchy era did not support fascism. The findings show that state political violence causes negative support for authoritarian regimes, providing a permanent challenge to the regime, hindering their legitimacy.	NA

2023	1158	BO06	Government-Opposition Partisanship and The Decline of Political Trust in Australia	In recent decades, Australia has experienced a decline in political trust. Research has shown that government performance and political detachment influence Australians’ distrust (Dasonneville and McAllister, 2020; Cameron, 2020). Yet, in electoral democracies, political parties are critical actors as they link voters and political institutions. This paper argues that voters with different levels of partisanship strength have a different perception of government performance (specific political support), and political trust (general political support). It is expected that supporters of the winning party will have greater political confidence than electoral losers. Moreover, strong government supporters should be more lenient towards government performance, while strong opponents should remain distrustful. Lastly, voters showing either weak party government support or weak support for the opposition, will be more likely to respond to performance in their evaluation of the government while also making more independent assessments of political institutions than stronger government and opposition partisans.

2023	1637	BO06	Do Voters Discount Party Positions?	The spatial theory of voting has frequently been criticized for assuming too much of the average voter: voters need to identify their personal ideal points and the locations of the party alternatives. Grofman's discounting models brings the political 'status quo' back in: voters are supposed to factor in how far candidates or parties, if elected, will be able to move the status quo towards their advertised spatial positions. Theoretically, the discounting model is a very compelling approach. It is able to explain patterns of polarizing trusteeship when party elites factor in discounting and assume much more 'extreme' policy stances than their electoral constituencies. The discounting model may also provide explanations for protest voting, electoral, and political polarization from within the spatial modeling tradition. Empirical applications, however, have been rare and often based on studies of individual cases or elections. This contribution aims at closing this critical research gap. We focus on rich evidence from the first four waves of the CSES project and apply Bayesian statistical tools so as to probe the added value of discounting party positions.	NA
2023	1799	BO06	Discounting the Political Costs of Policies: A Survey Experiment	The literature in political science and behavioural economics highlights that voters discount future economic costs when they can gain some advantage in the present. This study builds on this literature to investigate if voters facing a policy change discount future political costs too. Stemming from psychological theories, the main hypothesis is that political costs should be intrinsically different and less subject to discounting. A survey experiment fielded with Italian and UK participants empirically investigates this hypothesis. The findings show that voters strongly resist policies that will affect their choices in the future — that is, they don’t devalue future political costs even if they can have an economic advantage in the present. However, this is moderated by ideology: Voters with pre-existing views that are congruent with an irreversible policy better tolerate a restriction in future policy alternatives. These results have important implications for our understanding of voters’ preferences for policy outcomes. Moreover, these findings show that campaigns on issues of sustainability should stress future political costs more strongly than they do now.	NA
2023	1854	BO06	Bridging the (M)MP Gap: Differential Incumbency Effects in Mixed-Member Systems	Do citizens differentiate between nominally elected MPs and those elected via the party list? Recent literature on MPs’ legislative behaviour highlights the importance of an MP’s mandate for their strategic behaviour in parliament. However, the underlying assumption that citizens, too, differentiate between the two types of MPs in mixed-member systems has not yet been empirically tested. Using a novel dataset of incumbent German Bundestag MPs from 1953-2021, I show that MPs’ vote share in electoral districts does not significantly change because of their attained mandate. Further exploring this mechanism on the individual level, I demonstrate that citizens’ knowledge and re-election of MPs do not differ between list MPs and nominal MPs. I conclude that the mandate divide in mixed-member systems might be present among MPs but is not perceived by the citizens. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the causes of the mandate divide in the legislative behaviour literature. If citizens do not differentiate between MPs, then the strategic behaviour of district MPs either fails to hit its target or is differently motivated than initially assumed.	NA
2023	698	BO06	Under Paving Stones, the Votes! The relationship between improving the public realm and electoral fortunes	Public realm works constitute one of the most visible and constant actions governments undertake. Investment on public spaces has a direct impact on people's most familiar surroundings, their quality life, and their social capital. Yet, the retrofitting of public spaces may generate negative externalities, such as gentrification. Given the importance of public realm works, it is surprising that we are largely oblivious to their effect on political behaviour. This article examines the impact of a soft planning strategy known as the Catalan Neighbourhood Law, which had the goal of converting several designated urban areas--especially areas with acute urban deficits--into better and more sustainable places to live. After digitising the different interventions, as well as those areas that could have potentially been redeveloped but were not funded, the empirical design relies on a staggered DID and examines whether they improved the electoral support of the incumbent (or the opposition). To gauge the mechanism, we capture exposure to public realm improvements using geo-located individual-level surveys. This article has important implications for our understanding of the relationship between urban policies and political behaviour.	NA
2023	1039	BO07	Citizen imaginations of democracy	Citizens’ opinions and imaginations are crucial when it comes to designing democracy in the 21st century. Bottom-up understandings of democracy may not only help to democratize democratic theory (Asenbaum 2021), they may also be essential for robust anticipation of policy-makers when they engage in democratic reforms. We employ a new approach to analyse citizen answers to the open survey question ‘People have different ideas about what it means for a society to be a democracy. In your own words, what does democracy mean to you?´ We focus on representative samples in the US and Germany and identify distinct topics by applying Structural Topic Modeling. At the same time, we link citizen responses to survey questions on democratic values and democratic designs (preferences for representative, direct-democratic or technocratic decision-making), exploring whether citizen imaginations have some coherence with values and designs.

2023	118	BO14	Citizens' and Politicians’ Conceptualization of Democracy in an Electoral Autocracy: Evidence from Turkey	Robust public support for democracy is considered as an important factor to check undemocratic leaders. As such, there is considerable scholarly interest in uncovering the trade-offs voters face when deciding to vote between a democratic and undemocratic yet otherwise appealing party or candidate. This paper presents a conjoint experiment in this direction embedded in a nationally representative surveys in Turkey, an important electoral autocracy. Unlik e existing approaches, respondents face a choice betw een two hypothetical future scenarios for the country rather than fictional candidates, with random variations across the ideology of government, the state of the economy, orientation of foreign policy, and the country’s level of democracy. Analyses reveal which characteristics identify voters who prioritize democracy over other considerations.	NA
2023	1367	BO07	Reversing a Trend? A Longitudinal Analysis of the Evolution of Support for Stealth Democracy	With the contemporary increase in populism in many western democracies, scholarly interest in people's democratic process preferences has soared the past decade. Stealth democracy - the idea that the people do not really want active democratic participation and prefer politics to be efficient, including non-elected experts and business men - was introduced to capture what seem to be a participation-inclusion fatigue in the people. Yet, we know little about how support for stealth democracy changes over time, including how its socio-demographic and regional composition changes in a longitudinal perspective. Utilizing data from Denmark (2011 and 2019), I conclude that preferences for stealth democracy has significantly decreased over time. Yet, simultaneously, preferences for stealth democracy has become more polarized with stronger gender, educational, and regional divisions over time. Furthermore, we see support for new emerging parties vis-a-vis older and established parties are associated with stealth democracy preferences. The results are discussed in a future light, evaluating current democratic decision-making institutions in the light of individual preferences for stealth democracy.	NA
2023	344	BO07	Deaths of democracy? Electoral turnovers and excess mortality	The transfer of power via elections is an essential feature of democracies. We investigate the effect of such electoral turnovers on a crucial health measure, excess mortality. Our data comes from France, where local elections were held at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in mid-2020. Using regression, matching, and regression discontinuity designs to analyze 5,000 electoral decisions, we demonstrate substantial negative side-effects of electoral turnovers. Municipalities where the incumbent mayor was defeated experienced between 7 and 11 percentage points higher excess mortality as compared to municipalities were the incumbent held on to their office. Theoretical considerations and data on mask-wearing mandates suggest that electoral turnovers cause frictions, which can delay the implementation of effective disease-control measures. While crucial for the functioning of democracy, holding elections comes at a cost.	NA
2023	634	BO07	Who do citizens want to govern? Identifying preferences for combinations of actors in government across nine European democracies.	Research on citizens’ attitudes towards alternative actors in government is expanding, but limited in two respects: most studies have focused only on preferences for “ordinary citizens” and “independent experts” as decision-makers and most studies do not show preferences for combinations of actors. To address these shortcomings, we analyzed how citizens from nine European countries scored on 21 survey items recently developed by Hibbing and colleagues (2022) to capture preferences for a variety of actors and governing styles. The data were analysed through multi-group latent classes analysis, a method that is well-suited to identifying discrete clusters of individuals with similar patterns of response across multiple indicators. Our results point to seven different groups: 32% of citizens prefer being governed by a mix of actors; 16% are favourable towards expert-informed politicians; 14% demand a greater role for ordinary citizens; 12% are open to anything but politicians; 11% want expert-informed referenda; 10% support a combination of politicians and ordinary citizens; and 5% are only willing to be governed by experienced politicians. However, the size and socio-demographic characteristics of these groups differ across countries.	NA
2023	1691	PC23	Selective Negative Exposure? How Negative Partisanship Shapes Media Consumption Habits	A vast literature on the concept of selective exposure suggests that individuals tend to consume information that is congruent with their pre-existing dispositions, such as their preferred party. However, we still know little about the effects of negative partisanship, individuals' rejection of a particular party, on media consumption habits. Do negative partisans seek or avoid news about their disliked party? I attempt to answer this question through the combination of a three-wave panel survey (N = 2,200) and web-tracking data collected before and after the 2021 German federal election. I classify each news article read by respondents based on what party they refer to and its general tone (positive/negative). I then explore whether negative partisans consume disproportionately more or less news about their disliked party, and whether this is conditional on the polarity of the article. Results indicate that negative partisans avoid positive content about their disliked party, but do not seek negative content in order to 'validate' their aversion.	NA
2023	1802	PC23	The Friend of my Friend is my Enemy? Targeted Attacks and Coalition Logic on Negative Campaigning in Multiparty Systems	Negative campaigning, mostly a phenomenon of a two-party system like the U.S., is more actively used in multiparty systems. Here, the logic of attack is much more nuanced, as parties need to choose their targets based on coalition options and ideological compatibility. The question remains if parties are office-seeking or policy-seeking in these attacks. We test the effect of the feasibility of each coalition option and ideological proximity to each other party, on the target choice of political parties. We use data from 9 German state and federal elections between 2020 and 2022, where coalition options and probabilities vary both between elections and over time. We combine published polling results that lead to the mathematical possibility of coalitions, as well as the ideological distance between the respective parties. For negative campaigning, we classify attacks and targets from 3,600,000 social media posts using a transformer model trained on 50,000 manually annotated posts. We find that parties are strongly driven by their policy preferences - they will rather dampen attacks in general rather than attack their potential partners, even though coalitions are unlikely.	NA
2023	2012	PC05	How do politicians justify European integration? The link between party positions and their political discourses.	Do political parties use justifications in their speeches that support their positions on European integration? This paper explores this question by linking studies of political communication to the literature on political competition over European integration. We argue that parties in favour of integration are more likely to justify their views by appealing to normative integration values and the quality of policy outputs. Eurosceptic parties should focus on procedural rules, and they should deliver more emotionally negative messages. The empirical analysis focuses on four key debates over European integration: the Constitutional Convention, the debates about Sixpack and European Stability Mechanism, and Schengen. Using computational text analysis (seeded topic models and sentiment analysis), we find that communication strategies by and large follow partisan positions on the EU in support of positional strategies. Pro-integration parties are more likely to talk about democratic values, economic performance, social conditions, solidarity and human rights, whereas anti-integration parties focus on institutional procedures and invoke (less relevant) goals from other issue domains. When they refer to normative values, they tend to use negative framings.	NA
2023	511	PC23	Give the media what they want: Negativity as a media-access tool for politicians	Recent studies show that politicians' usage of negativity does not lead to higher approval among the public, yet politicians regularly use it. This begs the following question: why are politicians so negative if this strategy does not increase their re-election chances? In this paper, I argue that negativity usage by politicians is affected by the mediatization of politics: politicians use negativity because, due to the negativity bias in the news, it increases their chances of gaining media attention. I test this hypothesis using individual-level data on Belgian politicians’ negativity usage in the parliament and their presence in the prime-time TV news (2010-2020). The results show that going negative in the parliament significantly increases politicians' chances of appearing in the TV news later that day, despite controlling for relevant predictors such as politicians’ rank, gender, and ideology. In turn, once politicians get media attention due to negativity, their chance of going negative again in the future increases significantly.	NA
2023	756	PC23	Are highly tailored advertisements more successful in election campaigns? An empirical analysis of the content and impressions of parties’ Instagram and Facebook Ads in the 2021 German election campaign.	While it has been argued that parties adapt their messages to target groups to maximise electoral support, we know little about the content of these ads. How do parties tailor the content of these targeted messages and how is this tailoring influencing their success? Based on theoretical expectations derived from the literature about group appeals and party competition, we will provide empirical answers to these questions. We first show how parties tailor the content of their targeted campaign messages. Second, we investigate if the tailoring of campaign content leads to greater success. We tackle these questions using a manual content analysis of the Facebook and Instagram Ads by German parties (n=4200) during the 2021 general election and merging it with the novel Meta Ad Targeting Dataset. This gives us the opportunity to explore which target groups the parties selected to reach, and how they adapted the message content to these target groups. Lastly, we make use of the impressions of these ads as a measurement of success. The findings will provide original insights about the effects of modern election campaigns.	NA
2023	1535	BO10	Decentralizing States, Decentralizing Protests?	While the relationship between centralization and contention is well-documented, little work exists on the relationship between contention and decentralization. Leveraging insights from multilevel governance, community formation, and political behavior, we argue that state decentralization changes the structure and quantity of protest through three mechanisms. First, decentralization creates more arenas for contention where the chances for success are higher. Second, decentralization shifts the nucleus of political and economic power downwards, making localized social networks more important for mobilization. These networks are denser in the weak ties essential for political mobilization. Finally, these dynamics are self-reinforcing over time. We hypothesize that 1) higher levels of decentralization are associated with higher rates of protest throughout the country, 2) higher levels of regional authority are associated with higher rates of protest within that region, and 3) higher levels of decentralization are associated with less country-level synchronicity in protest rates because of decreased importance of national-level factors. We test our hypotheses using a novel dataset merging the Regional Authority Index, automated event counts, and regional and national-level socio-economic controls in 34 developed democracies from 2000-2018.

2023	1719	BO10	Role Perceptions of Subnational Representatives in Unitary Countries	Elected representatives have different role perceptions and they may privilege representing their constituents over representing their party, or vice versa. But which factors are driving representatives to lean towards one or the other? We develop two sets of hypotheses. First, representatives who have strong subnational attachments and who come from peripheral jurisdictions are more likely to find it important to represent their constituents. Second, the extent to which elected representatives are inclined to follow their voters instead of their party depends on the identarian and distributional consequences of the policy at hand. These hypotheses are tested through a survey experiment fielded to around 2,000 elected municipal and county representatives in Norway in February 2022. The results support our hypotheses: representatives –and especially those with strong subnational attachments—are more inclined to deviate from their party when the policy decision is related to the identity or welfare of the subnational jurisdiction. In addition, representatives –and especially those from rural and peripheral jurisdictions—are more inclined to deviate from their party when the costs are largely borne by the subnational jurisdiction.

2023	1927	BO10	Citizens under shock. The effect of crises upon preferences for power allocation.	The centralization of power is a predictable organizational pattern of crisis response. Following the emergence of unexpected shocks such as natural disasters, pandemics or economic recessions may lead to more centralized decision-making. Yet little is known on the extent to which citizens’ exposure to different types of crises may shape their attitudes towards the (de)centralization of power, on whether their attitudes actually correspond to a centripetal drift in power allocation or the duration of the effect. This paper explores these questions by theorizing on how various types of crises - namely short-term shocks such as sanitary crises or long-term threats such as climate change - may differently shape individuals’ preferences for the (de)centralization of power across supranational, national, regional or local authorities. Hypotheses are tested using both observational (panel) data and experimental studies in Spain. Empirical evidence shows that the covid-19 sanitary crisis prompted a centralizing drift in citizens’ preferences. Subject to further investigation, preliminary evidence regarding the impact of climate change shows that this type of crisis causes a centralizing drift towards supranational (European) institutions.

2023	752	BO10	Spatial social mobility, the social contract, and political consequences	The UK is a country divided by opportunity, some regions have a much higher proportion of upwardly mobile individuals and are more socially fluid than others. We argue that there has been a social contract implemented by the mainstream parties over the past 40 years, its foundation was that one ‘succeeded’ through upward mobility. We hypothesise that individuals’ (dis)contentment with the implicit social contract affects their political behaviour. Over and above one’s own mobility, individuals, through lived experience, see how neighbours, colleagues, family members, and friends, who tend to live in close vicinity, fare according to this social contract. We use multi-level models, and combine individual level data from Understanding Society with the most granular spatial mobility estimates available for the UK (Buscha et al., 2021). We show that living in a high absolute mobility Local Authority District increases the probability of turning out to vote in the 2010 General Election and voting ‘Remain’ in the 2016 European Union Referendum. The effect is for all individuals, irrespective of whether immobile, upwardly mobile, or downwardly mobile.	NA
2023	1389	BO11	Deliberative Mini-Publics and Legitimacy Perceptions: The Pernicious Consequences of Representative Bias	Deliberative mini-publics are increasingly catching the interest of policy-makers and democracy activists. An important hope associated with mini-publics is that they will help to alleviate public discontent with politics and contribute to perceptions of legitimate decision-making. I argue that the effects of mini-publics on legitimacy perceptions depend crucially on the extent to which they live up to the ideal of random selection and, more specifically, their composition reflects the broader citizenry. To test my expectations, I ran a pre-registered survey experiment in the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,200). I find that the involvement of mini-publics in political decision-making can increase legitimacy perceptions if its composition fully reflects the citizenry; however, even small deviations from representativity decrease these beneficial effects substantially while larger deviations can wipe them out entirely. Overall, these results constitute a challenge for hopes that mini-publics constitute an effective response to perceptions of political illegitimacy.	NA
2023	207	BO11	Investigating the Democratic Legitimacy of Citizens Climate Assemblies	Despite the scientific consensus on climate change and the need for major policy intervention, government action has been politically controversial and limited in scope. One potential solution is to give citizens direct influence over environmental policies through “Citizens’ Climate Assemblies,” thereby bypassing political gridlock. These deliberative mini-publics have been a key demand of many environmental groups, and the United Kingdom (among other countries) has taken modest steps in this direction. Yet if climate assemblies are to be effective, their decisions must cease to be mere recommendations. We present the results of two experiments fielded via a UK survey to investigate this central question: under what circumstances is the public more likely to support the use of binding citizens’ climate assemblies? The first experiment focuses on how the public reasons about granting extra influence to social groups that would be especially affected by climate change and climate change legislation. The second experiment examines how public support is shaped by elite partisan conflict and whether the climate assembly is promoted by politicians or the general public.	NA
2023	1825	BO15	Public opinion, consultation type & citizen assessments of unequal interest representation	The public image of interest groups is often bleak with concerns that decision-makers typically consult a biased set of interest groups. Our aim is to examine whether adapting the form of consultation and drawing attention to public opinion can be effective tools for decision-makers to lower concerns about inequality in interest representation. We test whether the use of open consultations reduces the negative impact of these inequalities on citizens’ legitimacy assessments of policy-making. Moreover, we examine whether adopting policy decisions that go against public opinion on an issue increases the negative consequences of inequalities in group involvement while acting in line with public opinion lowers them. Our expectations are tested through a survey experiment with a conjoint design. Attributes such as the type of consultation, interest group representation, and public opinion are randomly varied. The findings have important implications not only for understanding how different types of inequalities in interest group participation affect the legitimacy of policy making but for teasing out whether decision-makers can affect these assessments by their choice of consultation mechanisms and use of public opinion data.

2023	1843	BO15	Human after all? Public perceptions, politicians' lived experiences and interest representation	Past research suggests that institutions, which are descriptively more diverse are also more representative of a variety of societal sub-groups. However, most of this research has focused almost exclusively on (visible) demographic characteristics. We argue that there are compelling arguments for going beyond visible characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. In particular, we contend that shared lived experiences could help politicians ‘react more or less the way the voter would have done, on the basis of descriptive similarity’ (Mansbridge 1999: 644), particularly under unprecedented circumstances or in the context of unarticulated interests. With this paper, we go beyond descriptive similarities between representatives and represented by focusing on politicians’ reported non-professional interests, life-style choices and family status that lead to unique underlying experiences. By using conjoint design survey experiment, we will examine how knowledge of politicians’ lived experiences influences citizens’ evaluation of politicians' and parties' likability and policy-making competence on specific issues. We expect that information on politicians’ interests and backgrounds provides citizens with informational shortcuts that influence who voters perceive as most likeable and most able to develop meaningful policies.

2023	384	BO15	Aligning with your candidate: The effect of candidate-voter distance on electoral turnout	The degree of alignment of parties with their voters is the subject of extensive research. Recent evidence suggests that better party-voter matching reduces abstention rates. However, whether the same applies when considering the relationship between party candidates and voters has not yet been examined. Parties are dynamic political actors that internally conflate differing views, which are presented to voters through the different party candidates. The alignment of voters with certain party candidates may be sufficient to satisfy their representational demands. This paper argues that the relationship between candidate-voter congruence and turnout is stronger when the parties feature candidates who overlap with the ideological positioning of their voters. Conversely, an increase in abstention is anticipated if voters fail to relate to their potential representatives, and, as a result, distrust towards parties and elections intensifies. Using data from 72 elections (2005-2020), I estimate the overall level of ideological congruence and its effects on voter turnout for the first time with a many-to-many approach. The results highlight important oversights in how we conceptualise political representation, its quality and its impact on electoral participation.	NA
2023	552	BO15	How winning and losing affect citizens’ understanding of political representation	Does winning or losing an election influence citizens' understanding of whom a politician should represent? Generations of scholars have debated whether a representative should represent their voters or all citizens - however, insights into how and why citizens think about this have remained rare despite its democratic-theoretical relevance. I argue that winning causes citizens to perceive their interests as more important than the common good, whereas electoral losers expect their representatives to consider all interests equally. Relying on a regression discontinuity design in close German district elections, I demonstrate that winning induces citizens to expect their MP to represent their voters instead of the whole constituency. I present suggestive evidence that citizens' self-interested considerations rather than a reinforced group identity explain this winner-loser gap. My findings indicate that citizens understand democracy in a self-serving way and that winners are more willing to exclude political opponents from the democratic process.	NA
2023	1416	BO12	Political Gains or Democratic Principles? Issue Trade-offs and Democratic Backsliding	Recent studies have shown that citizens in established democracies are willing to make significant trade-offs between valued political goals and democratic principles. While the role of co-partisanship has been much studied in relation to democratic backsliding, we know less about the particular types of policy issues that are more likely to make citizens prioritize them over democratic norms. Yet, these questions are particularly salient in the context of European multiparty systems that have experienced significant party system realignments in recent years. Drawing on the literature on issue evolution and issue salience we hypothesize that identity-related issues which do not fit into the traditional left-right issue dimension are more likely to generate trade-offs between issue congruence and democratic principles. Our theoretical expectations are tested with evidence from a pre-registered conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey conducted in Finland (n=2406).	NA
2023	1589	BO12	Seeing the political climate change: Citizens' evaluation of democracy in contexts of backsliding	In the past decade, scholars have increasingly used citizens' evaluations of democracy as a benchmark for democratic performance. As 'microscope with a quality seal', surveys are considered alongside expert assessments. Contrasting with this optimistic perspective, literature on citizens' tolerance for democratic backsliding has questioned to which extent citizens are able to even recognize democratic backsliding and highlighted factors that may cloud citizens' judgement. In this paper, I bridge these two literatures to study whether citizens recognize democratic backsliding in contemporary Europe. Departing from the former literature, I look at changes over time which holds citizens to a higher standard than aggregate assessments. Departing from the latter, I look at large-scale trajectories of democratization and autocratization instead of assessing individual reforms via survey experiments. Building on the European Social Survey as well as original survey data, I show that while citizens' assessments show aggregate correlations with other indicators of democratic quality, they are not sensitive to democratic backsliding even in cases of protracted autocratization. Moreover, I show how party identification, political interest and education impact citizens' sensitivity to recognizing democratic backsliding.	NA
2023	343	PE27	Who Gave Up Democracy? Interest Groups and the Behavior of Connected Parliamentarians during the Democratic Backsliding in Japan 1928-1942.	Who vote to limit their own power during democratic backsliding? I examine the voting record, biography, electoral returns, interest group membership, and parliamentary group membership of the members of the House of Representatives in pre-war/wartime Japan (Election year: 1928, 1930, 1932, 1936, 1937, 1942), then run several difference-in-differences analyses taking advantage of exogenous shocks. I find that the parliamentarians backed by business or agricultural interest groups mostly resisted the power grab by the army after the Great Depression, but since the start of the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937), most of them flipped the positions and started to support the military rule. Interestingly, however, those industries that were irrelevant to the war effort (Silk, Banking, Brewery etc.) fervently supported the military cabinet, and those that were essential for the mobilization (Shipping, Railroads, Warehouses etc.) tended to oppose the war and military government. It appears that those sectors that were badly hurt by the war and sanctions desperately needed quid pro quo to receive governmental support, while those retained some bargaining power vis-à-vis the military struggle to defend democratic institutions.

2023	438	BO12	Coiled Preferences	Recently, surprising political events like Donald Trump’s election and Brexit have shaken the world. Their aftermath brought temporary spikes in behavior at odds with democratic norms, like hate crimes. What explains these spikes? We argue that the explanation is to be found in a process that we term coiled preferences. When individuals have views that are counternormative, they have an incentive to falsify them. We contend that, when there is a norm changing event and previously stigmatized behavior becomes more acceptable, individuals who had previously falsified their preferences engage in the previously stigmatized behavior at a rate that is higher than it would be if there had never been a norm against that behavior. We test this expectation with a lab experiment, where we manipulate the cost of acting on someone’s private preference, and compare how individuals behave in a private (non-observable) and public (observable) condition. After some rounds, we remove that cost. We this removal will make individuals in the public condition become more likely to act on their private preference than those in the private condition.	NA
2023	878	BO12	Winners’ Restraint in Established Democracies: How far do winners’ have to go before rejecting political outcomes when democratic norm violations accumulate?	Recent concerns about democratic backsliding in established democracies have raised the question: Will citizens notice violations of democratic norms and reject political decisions that lead to their desired outcome? Existing studies paint a pessimistic picture, suggesting that citizens are unable to restrain themselves when on the winning side of political competition and to call out undemocratic behaviour for what it is. This paper investigates winners’ restraint in the UK. It adds to the literature on citizens’ ability to resist undemocratic practices by examining winners’ reaction to accumulating violations of democratic norms. Just as in the real world democratic erosion happens gradualy, we test whether citizens are responsive or become immune to repeated violations of democratic norms. Results show that, while double standards exist and winning is the main predictor for peoples’ perceived legitimacy of political decisions, citizens are sensitive to repeated norm violations. In two experimental studies, we investigate how far winners are willing to go before rejecting flawed processes, and find that a majority of winners change their perceptions of fairness and legitimacy when exposed to multiple flaws.

2023	1016	BO13	Does Polarization Engage or Disenchant Citizen?: Repeated Cross-Sectional Evidence from thirty Democracies	Democratic governance is eroding, while elite polarization is rising. However, it is unclear whether polarization is as detrimental to democratic governance as this trend implies or whether it is actually beneficial and engaging. Several studies have found that polarization increases turnout and overall political engagement, but elite polarization is also associated with the rise of extreme parties. This contribution argues that these disparaging observations are a result of the different ways in which attitude formation and political behaviour respond respond to elite polarization. I present a new mechanism and measure to understand the individual level effect of polarization on voter satisfaction with democracy and voting intentions. I test this relationship across 30 democracies using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. I consistently find a negative effect of polarization on democratic satisfaction across all data sources, policy, and ideological dimensions. At the same time I find a consistent positive effect on turnout. Consequently, polarization can be both a boon for engaging the electorate and increasing turnout and a bane for decreasing satisfaction with democracy.	NA
2023	1505	BO13	When Losers Dissent: The Effect of Electoral Defeat on Party Preferences	How do partisan preferences develop in the aftermath of an election? An establishedliterature studies the stability of individual attitudes over time, and researchers often assume that partisanship is fixed during electoral periods. Against these assumptions, we demonstrate that elections cause large partisan shifts among voters. We argue that after elections losers might distance themselves from previously voted parties, while winners remain safely attached to the bandwagon. We demonstrate this phenomenon both at the level of parties and of individual voters. First, we leverage monthly opinion polls to show that defeated parties lose support among the electorate in the aftermath of national elections. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest lasting negative effects on party support. Second, we use household panel surveys to establish that voters who supported declining parties are more likely to change in favor of gaining parties. This paper contributes to the literature on post-electoral politics by highlighting a new dimension along which democratic winners and losers diverge. Moreover, the existence and magnitude of post-electoral partisan shifts suggest caution about the assumption of stable preferences common in much applied work.	NA
2023	1533	BO13	Why does Radical Party Entry Reduce Satisfaction with Democracy? The Role of Affective Polarization	Elections generally boost satisfaction with democracy (SWD) but not among radical and populist party voters. These two findings are hardly compatible with the single in-group logic that takes SWD changes as a function of the own party results. Instead, this paper proposes that affectively polarized radical voters will also react to the out-group party outcomes. When facing a defeat, a negative response to the out-group win will outweigh the positive impact of the relative in-group success. We test this argument by leveraging the uncertainty between rounds of the 2022 French presidential election. First, we prime voters of the new radical candidate Éric Zemmour with their party's relative success or their primary opponent's victory (Macron). Consistently with the expectations, priming Zemmour's voters with Macron's victory substantially decreases SWD, but none of the in-group conditions has any significant effect. Second, a qualitative analysis of an open-ended question supports an affective mechanism. These findings shed light on the relationship between SWD and affective polarization. Contrary to representation theories, the institutional inclusion of marginalized groups may only exacerbate dissatisfaction in highly polarized electoral contexts.	NA
2023	348	BO13	Electoral Outcomes and Satisfaction with Democracy: A Comparison of Regional and National Elections	Subnational governments have become more numerous and more powerful around the world, increasing the importance of subnational elections. However, we still know little about the impact of electoral outcomes on citizens’ political support, and there is no systematic comparison of the impact of election outcomes on citizens’ satisfaction with democracy. In this research, we provide such a comparison by investigating how the winner-loser gap in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy differs at different levels of election, that is, regional and national ones. Using the Making Electoral Democracy Work dataset, the largest comparative database that comprises elections held at different levels of governance, we first show that there is a winner-loser gap in satisfaction with democracy at the regional level following regional elections in Canada, Germany and Spain. However, this gap is substantially smaller than the gap generated by national election outcomes. Finally, we find some heterogenous effects for voters who believe that the regional government strongly influences their quality of life. We conclude by discussing the implications for public opinion research as well as electoral and regional studies.	NA

Analyzing the Impact of Elections on Individuals’ Support for Democracy	Winning and losing elections affects individuals' support for core principles of democracy. However, most previous studies on the subject have been unable to isolate the impact of winning/losing from the correlates of party choice. This paper quasi-experimentally studies how winning and losing elections affects individuals’ support for democracy and checks and balances, and how differences between winners/losers change as elections lose salience (as time passes, after elections have taken place). We exploit the coincidence of the fieldwork of the EVS and ESS with national elections, as well as variation in the timing of survey interviews with respect to the election day in the CSES. This identification strategy provides exogenous variation in winner/loser status and election salience. This allows us to causally assess whether winners are willing to exercise restraint without abusing their position as winners, and losers are willing to accept their defeat without questioning the democratic system. Crucially, our design also allows us to study whether the potential lack of restraint and consent that immediately follows elections dissipates as time goes by and elections lose salience.	NA
2023	1390	BO053	Technopols, technocrats, technopopulists: Which attitudes drive support for technocratic ministers? A conjoint experiment in 15 countries.	The appointment of technocratic ministers is becoming more popular among parties in Parliament and the public opinion in general. In line with this trend, the literature on technocracy has burgeoned in the last years: while technocratic attitudes have been extensively explored, we still lack a thorough understanding of the relationship between the support for technocracy and other attitudes which theoretically have been associated with it. Building on a recent paper, which explored the drivers for technocratic minister selection, we first explore the extent to which technocratic attitudes among citizens are positively related to support for technocratic profiles in government. Secondly, as suggested by recent works, we test whether there is an elective affinity between populist attitudes and technocracy. Thirdly, we investigate whether there is a negative relationship between support for parliamentarism and technocracy. To do so, we rely on a novel conjoint experiment in 15 countries and about 25.000 respondents.	NA
2023	1705	BO14	Rose-colored glasses or suspicion? Effects of party cues on evaluations of checks and balances reforms	Reforms of checks and balances are often used to reshape and undermine existing democratic institutions. How do citizens respond to such reforms? This paper studies the effects of party cues on (a) support for reforms and (b) motivations assigned to the reformers who propose to reform checks and balances. In addition, it investigates whether citizens evaluate such reform proposals differently than other proposals. It compares the checks and balances reforms to an inconsequential administrative reform without differential effects on citizens depending on their position vis-à-vis the government. Using a mixed-design survey experiment with a large sample (N = 1040) of Polish citizens, the study shows that (1) the supporters of the ruling party evaluate all reforms through rose-colored glasses, whereas the opponents are more suspicious of potential violations of democratic rules; (2) the administrative reform was evaluated more positively and not seen as ill-intended, by contrast with the checks and balances reforms. All in all, citizens see reforms of checks and balances differently depending on who proposes them. However, overall, these reforms are not received with great enthusiasm.	NA
2023	1754	BO14	Tolerance towards Minority Groups, Affective Polarization and Support for Democratic Norms: The cases of Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain	Affective polarization is rising in most contemporary democracies, where support for democratic norms is suffering significant erosion along with levels of tolerance towards different political, cultural and social minorities. Despite some contributions, the relationship among these three factors is little studied, especially from a comparative perspective. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between tolerance towards minority groups, affective polarization and citizen commitment to democratic norms in five countries of southern Europe and Latin America. Our argument is that intolerance towards those groups fuels both partisan affective polarization and rejection of democratic and liberal norms; and that affective polarization in turn reinforces anti-democratic attitudes (especially those related to the possibility of banning parties), partially mediating the impact of social intolerance. To test these expectations, the paper uses an original panel survey (TRI-POL) which was carried out between September 2021 and April 2022 in Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This dataset contains thermometer feelings towards different social groups (e.g. immigrants, homosexuals, territorial/ethnic groups) and voters of parties in each country, attitudes towards democratic norms and other information from respondents.

2023	331	BO14	The Limits of Party Loyalty: How Election Cheating Affectively (De)Polarizes Voters	Recent research suggests that increased partisan polarization and animosity have driven voters to tolerate - or even endorse - violations of democratic rules and norms, raising concerns about the stability of American democracy. This study examines whether partisans' tolerance of undemocratic behavior extends to election cheating. Using three novel, preregistered survey experiments, the study demonstrates that partisans do not display a partisan double standard, disapproving disproportionately of cheating by opponents. The findings show that even relatively subtle forms of election cheating by an in-partisan candidate affectively depolarizes voters, whereas similar cheating by an out-partisan candidate polarizes. Exposure to in-partisan election cheating causes voters to reduce in-party affect and simultaneously increase out-party affect. However, these backlash effects depend on the information source. When out-partisan media provides the information, partisans tend to dismiss the information as incredible cries of foul play. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democracy's viability and provide some counterbalance to the current narrative that partisan tribalism undermines voters' commitment to democracy. The findings also speak to the role of partisan identification as an unmoved mover.	NA
2023	405	BO14	Democracy, group identity and political entrepreneurs: Why people trade-off democracy for group interests	In many countries around the world the majority of citizens find democracy the best form of government – and yet they vote for political actors who subvert it. Using a candidate-choice conjoint experiment we established that voters in seven European countries (Serbia, Poland, Germany, Ukraine, Spain, Sweden, and Estonia) tend to trade off democratic principles for interests that are related to the group they belong to. We also measured polarization, which often served as an explanation for voters’ willingness to tolerate undemocratic behavior, but could not identify an increased polarization for many of the interests for which voters would trade off democracy. Drawing on empirical evidence from two countries from the survey sample (Poland and Serbia) in which substantial democratic backsliding recently occurred, this paper offers additional explanation of voters’ increased tolerance for undemocratic behavior. Using the process tracing, and building on the findings from social psychology, the paper demonstrates that in Poland and Serbia, political entrepreneurs (Jaroslaw Kaczynski and PiS; Aleksandar Vucic and SNS) managed to subvert democracy by politicizing in-group identity and weaponizing it against democracy, regardless of polarization.

2023	1141	BO16	Which economic and cultural issues drive affective polarization?	Comparative research identifies strong correlations between competing parties’ differences on cultural and economic issues, on the one hand, and citizens’ cross-party hostility, i.e., affective polarization, on the other. Yet we do not know which specific cultural or economic issues drive affective polarization. We analyze this question with a priming experiment with 11,000 individuals across 10 western publics, which prompts respondents to provide open-ended answers to a prompt inviting them to discuss how political parties compete either on cultural or economic issues. We find that respondents who discuss immigration, as either a cultural or an economic issue, express significantly more resentment and distrust towards political opponents. We conclude that immigration debates significantly drive affective polarization, regardless of whether citizens view these debates through a cultural or an economic frame.	NA
2023	1736	BO16	Do Masses Become More Affectively Polarized When Elite Ideological Polarization Increases? A Quasi-Experimental Analysis	Does elite polarization increase affective polarization? I study this question with a real-world a sudden increase in elite polarization in the United Kingdom when the Labour Party suddenly adopted a more extreme ideological stance in 2015. Using British Election Study Internet Panel data, I find that higher ideological elite polarization leads to higher affective polarization. Moreover, the effect of elite polarization is not only limited to in-partisans (i.e., Labour identifiers) but it also extends to out-partisans (i.e., Conservative identifiers). Importantly, in-party feelings drive the increase in affective polarization more than out-party feelings. Affective polarization is not necessarily a reflection of out-party animosity but can fluctuate due to changes in in-party enthusiasm, which cautions against a bipolar conceptualization of in- and out-party feelings. Lastly, I show that the causal direction between how citizens perceive elite ideological polarization and how affectively polarized they are is bidirectional, which means that affective polarization is rooted both in identity and policy. While some levels of affective polarization are inherent in democracies, affective polarization can, to a certain extent, be tamed by moderate position-taking by parties.	NA
2023	1743	BO16	Partisan Identity and Affective Polarization in France	This paper analyses to what extent affective polarization (AP) leads citizens to discriminate against members of a political out-group in a non-political setting. We rely on data from a conjoint experiment that was conducted as part of the 2022 French election study, in which participants choose a potential lodger between two individual profiles, characterised among others by their partisan preference. This allows determining to what extent respondents’ choices are influenced by the partisan leaning of the potential lodgers, and whether this effect is stronger among affectively polarised citizens. Such effects of AP have been observed in other settings. We extend this approach in two ways. First, we include partisan social identity (Huddy et al. 2018) as a moderator. We expect negative effects of AP to be more pronounced when citizens’ partisanship is a more central part of their social identity. Second, we measure AP in two distinct ways: based on affect towards political parties or towards the supporters of these parties. This makes it possible to assess which form of AP is more likely to lead to discrimination against out-groups.	NA
2023	333	BO16	Winners' Loathing: The Role of Affective Polarization on Democratic Dissatisfaction after Elections	This article examines how certain partisan dynamics during elections, aimed at capitalizing on the votes of party sympathizers and weakening political opponents, also influence affective polarization and citizens' perceptions of the functioning of democracies. More specifically, the contribution of this article lies in examining the mechanisms through which affective polarization reduces post-election satisfaction with democracy after elections, particularly among winners, thus narrowing the winner-loser gap. To this end, the article is divided into two sections. First, the article examines the main triggers of affective polarization in electoral campaigns, focusing on two phenomena: party/ideological polarization and negative campaigning. Second, this paper examines the relationship between affective polarization and the winner-loser gap. The findings show party polarization increases the level of affective polarization, while the empirical evidence on the effects of negative campaigning on this phenomenon is not entirely robust. Moreover, the results show that the winner-loser gap decreases significantly due to the decline in satisfaction with democracy among affective polarized winners.	NA
2023	1722	BO17	Environmental Attitude Politicisation in Britain, 1990-2022	Major reforms are required to address climate change. These become more difficult to implement when public opinion on environmental issues becomes politicised, whereby disagreements on these issues become aligned with party support and with broader cultural ideological divides. There is considerable evidence that such environmental politicisation has occurred in the US since the 1990s. Outside of the US, our ability to assess the evolution of environmental politicisation is limited because most studies rely on either cross-sectional evidence or trends in single opinion measures. We use multilevel modelling to study the politicisation of environment opinion in Britain across 47 environment items over a three-decade period. We find that Britons’ environmental attitudes have become increasingly aligned with partisanship and cultural ideology. Studying multiple environment items allows us to show that this pattern is not restricted to beliefs about climate change, but also applies to attitudes concerning environmental policy and behaviours. However, we also find that levels of environmental politicisation in Britain remain limited relative to that found in the US. Evidence for the impact of elite cues on environmental politicisation is mixed.	NA
2023	525	BO17	Do right-wing populist messages affect public support for climate policy? Exploring socio-cultural and economic inequality mechanisms	Right-wing populist (RWP) parties are gaining popularity at the same time as the climate crisis is escalating. Scholars have studied RWP parties’ positions on climate change and RWP supporters’ opposition to climate policy. Yet, little is known about the effect of RWP rhetoric about climate change on individual opposition to climate policy. Individuals can reject climate policy if the latter puts a strain on individuals’ economic conditions via threat to employment with the closure of carbon intensive or increased living costs with carbon tax (e.g. the economic dimension) and/or if they see the climate agenda as being espoused by a liberal, cosmopolitan elite (e.g. the cultural dimension). This paper investigates these two dimensions using a survey experiment conducted in the United Kingdom (UK). We draw on framings actually used by real right-wing figures prominent in the UK debate, either blaming climate policy for the cost-of-living crisis or casting climate policy as the ideological project of progressive urbanites. This experiment would help us make causal inferences about what drives individuals to oppose climate policies, and how they express that opposition.	NA
2023	584	BO17	Can fiction make the climate crisis real?	Can fiction make the climate crisis real? Globally, low levels of climate awareness, belief, and concern suggests that existing strategies to change opinions and behavior around climate change remain relatively ineffective (Leiserowitz et al. 2022). In this paper, we examine a new strategy for inducing climate awareness building on work in psychology and political science that uses narrative strategies to shape attitudes and behavior. This approach, called perspective-getting, can change opinions on a range of subjects from immigration and refugee acceptance to LGBTQ rights (Eyal et al 2018, Kalla and Broockman 2021, Adida et al 2022). We design a narrative treatment that goes beyond the standard perspective-getting approach, using fictional narratives to both convey information and evoke emotion, which can affect information processing and information-seeking behavior. In a large cross-country online experiment, we randomly expose respondents to a purse control condition, to a factual scientific framing of climate information, and to a fictional narrative containing the same information to test the effectiveness of fictional climate narratives in improving climate literacy.

2023	657	BO17	Are All Cyclists Green? The Link between Political and Non-Political Environmentally-Friendly Behaviour	How are political and non-political behaviour on the environment linked? Discussions on how to tackle climate change often focus on individual actions of sustainable consumption and more environmentally-friendly habits. As the environment becomes more politicised, to what extent do voters separate political behaviour from other types of behaviour? How can these behaviours be influenced? We argue that political cues and policies can be an important way to shape voters’ behaviour. We test these questions using geocoded data on voting and bike commuting behaviour in France from 2007-2020. We first explore the association between these two behaviours. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we test how political elites can influence voters’ environmentally-friendly behaviour: If they do so through cueing mechanisms or through policies such as building new bike lanes. In additional analyses, we explore the individual level mechanisms of the link between environmentally-friendly and voting behaviours. Overall, these results are important for our understanding of the relationship between the individual-level behaviours of citizens and climate policy-making.	NA
2023	1280	BO18	Economic foundations of socio-cultural politics: how new left and radical right voters think about inequality	The shift to the modern knowledge economy has pitted highly educated winners against less educated losers and given rise to the political divide between the new left and the radical right. While we can observe the political repercussions of this transformation, it remains unclear whether this political divide is underpinned by individual perceptions of economic and social inequalities. Do new left and radical right voters indeed evaluate social inequalities as most important and politicized? Or do they link economic and social concerns more closely than the socio-cultural polarization of this divide may suggest at first glance? Which inequalities are central to these groups and which are perceived as neglected by politics? Drawing on an original survey fielded in Germany in 2022, we show that both highly and less educated voters place strong emphasis on both economic and social inequalities. Low educated voters, in particular, place more emphasis on the importance of socioeconomic differences, but feel that politics is not sufficiently addressing them. Understanding how voters link economic and social inequalities is relevant to better understand policy demands and responsiveness.	NA
2023	1429	BO18	Cheering for a rigged system? Explaining working-class votes for the meritocracy	Meritocratic beliefs are consequential in explaining support for redistribution, yet we still know little of why working-class individuals buy into the rhetoric of meritocracy despite low levels of upward mobility. To differentiate among competing explanations related to a lack of alternatives, aspirational beliefs, or a psychological benefit, I complement cross-sectional time series with a survey experiment. The design makes participants choose between class and merit-based political rhetoric. By asking participants to state their preference, associating the rhetoric with policy content, and measuring the effect on social identity, the experiment will show if working-class participants prefer a merit-based discourse to a class-based one when given an alternative, and clarify the mechanism through which this happens.	NA
2023	519	BO18	Economic Inequality and Affective Polarization Between the Rich and the Poor - Experimental Evidence from Three Countries	Does economic inequality lead to higher levels of affective polarization between the rich and the poor? We advance two competing theoretical arguments: On the one hand, psychological theories of class conflict assume that inequality accentuates perceptions of individual economic positions, leading to more pronounced class identifications among both low- and high-income people. Consequently, resentment and animosity towards the out-group will increase and affective polarization between the rich and the poor intensifies. On the other hand, since inequality diminishes the material status of the lower socioeconomic classes, political economists hypothesize that rising levels of economic inequality will decrease the class identity among the poor. Consequently, affective polarization should be reduced. To test these expectations empirically, we conduct survey experiments in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Respondents are treated with different information on the countries overall level of economic inequality as well as their own position in the income distribution. The results will show to what extent inequality affects hostility between low- and high-income people, thereby undermining mutual respect and dialogue, which are some of the cornerstones of well-functioning democracies.

2023	671	BO18	Do opinion-based or social group identities (or both) divide society? Evidence from a survey experiment in Britiain	Do people like social groups because of their political opinions, or do people like political opinion-based camps due to the social group associated with that opinion? Answering this question is important for understanding the sources of political and social conflicts. We build a theoretical model of why opinion-based and social group-based polarization are connected. We test our theoretical assumptions with a survey experiment in Britain. The opinion-based identities we address are rooted in the universalist-nationalist cleavage, namely immigration and the environment. The social group we focus on is the working class, a group of considerable salience in the British context. When self-identifying working class members are informed that the working class is the majority in one of the opinion-based camps, working class respondents feel closer towards the camp for which the working class was shown to be the majority supporter. However, respondents feel more distant from the working class when they perceive that the working class is the majority in their opposing opinion-based camp. Our results offer a novel perspective on how socio-structural identities are linked to post-materialist opinion-based camps.	NA
2023	1553	BO19	Cost of Ruling Above All Else: Explaining Presidential Popularity in France	This chapter examines the drivers of presidential popularity in the context of the French Fifth Republic. French presidents over time have strikingly similar experiences in terms of popularity: a peak after the election soon followed by a process of erosion. This “cost of ruling” pattern is particularly strong in the Fifth Republic, facilitated by the concentration of power in the hands of presidents, making them the person to blame. Cost of ruling tends to dominate other possible drivers of popularity and hinders the president’s capacity to benefit from good economic conditions. This changes only during cohabitations, when presidents and prime ministers are of different parties or coalitions: power sharing makes the president more popular and better able to gain from good economic performance. Our analyses also reveal that this cost of ruling has increased over time: in the early years of the Fifth Republic presidents enjoyed consistently higher levels of popularity, but this is no longer the case.

2023	1563	BO19	Moving beyond the Economy: Executive Approval in Spain	This chapter revisits the effects of economic performance on executive approval in Spain and identifies new non-economic factors that provide a more comprehensive account of approval dynamics. As regards the role of the economy, we show that it still is a crucial predictor of approval ratings in Spain, but also provide evidence that its influence has fluctuated over time. As regards non-economic factors, we find that the salience of terrorism is strongly associated with positive approval ratings in Spain. Similarly, congruence between mass preferences and government ideology results in higher approval ratings. By contrast, when mass preferences deviate from the incumbent’s ideology, the popularity of the latter deteriorates, which might ultimately result in electoral turnover. Our study suggests that the economy continues to be a crucial factor behind government popularity in Spain, but also uncovers the role of other contextual factors like issue salience and mass preferences, which have received much less attention so far.

2023	1585	BO19	Weakened ties: the economy and presidential approval in the 21st Century United States	Presidential approval in the United States has been the most consistently watched variable in American politics for decades. Not surprisingly, political scientists have also followed the measure closely and developed a long and deep literature about both its causes and effects. We review the historical development of those literatures and examine approval over the 1953–2020 period. The economy and approval were once inextricably related, and that connection was a linchpin of the literature on economic voting. But, with increased partisan polarization, presidential approval seems to have been detached from economic measures and, perhaps, from everything except partisanship.	NA
2023	1595	BO19	Economics, Politics, and the Popularity Function: Past, Present and Future	What role does the economy play in shaping executive approval? And what factors explain why this economy-approval relationship varies across time and countries? We begin with a review of cross-national studies with an eye toward how contextual features affect the strength of the economy in vote and popularity functions. In doing so, we attempt to assess a question that Paldam (1991) asked: How large is the e-fraction (the economy) compared to the p-fraction (politics)? Then we turn to the country case study chapters in this volume, characterizing them according to Lijphart’s (1971) case study typology: theory-confirming, theory-infirming, hypothesis-generating, and deviant case studies. Ten of the 11 case studies are categorized as fully or partially confirming. Additionally, a few of these can also be considered hypothesis-generating or deviant in that they provide new insights regarding the role of inequality, government responsiveness, and economic measures, topics that deserve further study. In the closing section, we discuss additional avenues for further research such as how the pandemic, climate change, migration, and threats to democracy may impact executive approval ratings in the future.

2023	1599	BO19	Executive Approval from the 1990s to the 2010s: A Pooled Analysis of Twenty Countries	Single-country analyses reported in this volume show that while the economy often drives popularity, its effect is not consistent across countries nor over time within them. This chapter re-examines the economics-politics relationship in cross-national perspective. Returning to Paldam’s instability dilemma, we address two questions. First, are the factors identified as drivers of approval in individual country studies replicated in a pooled popularity function? Second, do cross-country differences in political context, issue salience, and political dispositions interfere, facilitate, or otherwise condition the economics-politics connection? Multivariate analyses of approval across 20 countries from the 1990s through 2019 show that the economy-popularity relationship varies across both time and space. While the magnitude of the economy’s effect has on average diminished since the turn of the 21st Century, the change is much more pronounced in some countries than in others, and in some nations, its effect has even increased.

2023	1381	BO040	The Mediating Role of Societal Recognition for Radical Right Voting in Left Behind Places	Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior is rooted in geographic inequalities. Citizens living in relatively deprived places are assumed to feel left behind by globalization and politics, which, in turn, decreases their feeling of societal recognition and makes them more susceptible to radical-right parties. However, this two-step mechanism has rarely been tested directly since previous studies often focused either on the attitudinal level or on aggregate-level effects. This paper examines whether the individuals’ living place affects the feeling of lacking societal recognition and hence, contributes to radical-right voting. The study focuses on Germany as a particularly interesting case because of previous inconclusive empirical evidence regarding the effects of regional inequalities. Geocoded survey data is used to analyze the relationship between living in a ‘left behind place’ and the subjective ‘feeling of being left behind’ by relying on fine-grained measures of living conditions and an original measurement of perceived societal recognition. Subsequently, the analyses focus on the relation of lacking societal recognition and voting behavior as well as the underlying mediation model.	NA
2023	1732	BO040	Demand for place-based representation across the urban-rural divide: insights from a conjoint experiment	Recent literature highlights the role of place-based identities, grievances, and resentments in contemporary politics, particularly ‘rural consciousness’ (Cramer, 2016). It is argued that this involves demand for more political representation, but there are many ways that political actors can represent rural and urban places, descriptively, symbolically and substantively. We investigate evidence of demand for elected members of Parliament to represent rural and urban areas in specific ways. We employ a paired candidate choice conjoint experiment, with nearly 2,000 respondents in urban areas and 2,000 in rural areas of the UK. Profiles vary the residential history of politicians, their interest group engagement, their affective stance towards urban and rural areas, and their surrogacy on behalf of urban or rural areas more generally. Our analysis compares effects for rural and urban residents, by level of place identity, local pride and in-group/out-group attitudes. Our results help understand why place-based appeals remain prevalent (Jacobs and Munis, 2019) and whether politicians gain or lose from polarising anti-urban rhetoric (Costa, 2021).	NA
2023	237	BO040	The influence of place-based consciousness on rural and urban candidate choice in Germany	This study tests rural and urban consciousness as defining factors of candidate choice in a least likely setting – Germany. Place-based consciousness is defined as a strong identification with one’s place of living plus feelings of hostility towards out-groups who are perceived to look down on the in-group and keep the in-group from receiving its fair share of public resources. I argue that place-based consciousness determines how candidates from different political parties and backgrounds are perceived, and subsequently, which candidate is chosen by the citizen. By using experimental data from a conjoint experiment together with an extensive measure of place-based consciousness, I can show that it does influence candidate choices of German voters. The results suggest that place-based identities and grievances not only exist in Germany, but can also play a pivotal role in voting behaviour.	NA
2023	712	BO040	Confidence across cleavages: the Swiss rural-urban divide in political trust	Since political trust is crucial to the survival of political systems, securing its high levels is essential. While Switzerland exhibits a large rural-urban divide in the quarterly votes, it has not yet been researched whether there exists also a divide in political trust. Evidence from the European context points to a geographical component of political trust with rural residents being less trusting, as they feel left behind their urban counterparts. On the other hand, the design of the Swiss political system and the country's small-scale nature suggest no divide. I investigate the Swiss rural-urban divide in trust in the government, the parliament, the justice system and politicians using an original data set from September 2022. Results reveal a significant but irrelevantly small divide. The key to the absence of such a divide might lie in place-based identity. When interacting place-based identity with place of living, it reveals that rural residents exhibit higher levels of political trust than urban residents when place-based identity is low, while trust is higher in urban than in rural places for high levels of identity.

2023	75	BO040	Mapping Stereotypes Along the Urban-Rural Divide: Comparative Evidence from Europe	In recent years, political scientists have documented a re-emergence of the urban-rural divide in Europe’s political landscape. After several decades at the margins of cleavage politics, a growing body of literature has diagnosed a return of geography, pointing towards an increasingly polarized conflict between cities and the countryside. While existing studies have highlighted important differences in political behavior between urban and rural dwellers, how this conflict actually manifests itself in peoples’ minds remains largely unexplored. Crucially, this leaves the precise mechanisms that make place politically divisive unclear. Combining open-ended survey questions with a conjoint experiment fielded in nine European countries, this paper sheds light on the prevalent stereotypes individuals associate with people living in urban and rural areas. Expecting that individuals particularly stereotype ruralites as nationalists and urbanites as cosmopolitans, the results of this analysis have important implications for our understanding of how geography underpins existing political conflicts.

2023	1325	BO21	When voters follow the issue, not the leader: Evidence from referendum campaigns	How do voters reconcile a conflict between their issue preferences and their favourite parties’ positions? Recent studies highlight that voters often “follow the leader”, by aligning their opinions with those of their favourite political leaders. Yet, even in polarized societies, there are instances in which voters take positions that contrast with party positions, such as in referendum campaigns. In this study, I argue that after voting in a referendum, a relevant share voters “follow the issue” and change party preferences to accommodate issue preferences. I test this argument with cross-sectional and panel data related to four referendums in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Results show that support for parties changes substantially following referendum results in each country, with some voters “switching” to the parties that are aligned with their own position on the referendum proposals, although ideological distance between voters and parties moderates vote switching. Additional evidence from a survey experiment addresses potential issues of reverse causality and confirms that voters increase support for parties that share their own issue preferences.	NA
2023	457	BO21	Political Campaigns and Attitudinal Consistency: How the Use of Direct Democracy Affects Attitudes	We argue that single-issue political campaigns leading up to a ballot vote affect voters' attitudes on a broad set of issues. We show that these effects depend on whether the debated issue aligns well with the main dimension of political conflict or not. These effects are long-lasting and their strength varies across individuals in a predictable manner. We exploit issue-specific campaigns before direct democratic votes at the ballot box which occur frequently in Switzerland. The estimation results show that direct democratic ballot votes have an effect on the attitudinal consistency of citizens, both in the short- and in the long-term: ballot votes more aligned with main dimension of conflict are associated with more consistent attitudes and this association persists across time. These findings have implications for normative and empirical research.	NA

2023	963	BO21	Leadership on the campaign trail: How main candidates shape voters’ views on party unity during election campaigns	Politicians on the campaign trail need to keep their parties united because internal strife is a major electoral disadvantage. Drawing on theories of political leadership, we investigate the dynamic relationship between voters’ candidate images and their perceptions of party unity. Over the course of the campaign, voters’ assessments depend on the actions of main candidates – especially when “scandals” surface and opponents attack – and the capacity of such actions in reinforcing a united appearance of the party. We examine these relationships and dynamics in the run-up to the German election of 2021. This is a particularly fruitful case because there was no incumbent chancellor to anchor candidate images. Specifically, we bring together a unique rolling cross-section panel survey spanning five months before election day with data on media portrayals of intra-party strife. This allows us to trace over-time changes in voters’ perceptions of candidate image and party unity in an exceptionally fine-grained manner. Our analysis contributes a novel, agentic perspective to the literature on campaigning and provides new insights as to how elections are personalized in the minds of the voters.	NA
2023	1613	BO22	Face to Face With the Candidates: Donors at Political Fundraising Events	Campaign donations of individual donors in the US have been linked to reduced responsiveness by politicians to their constituents as well as increases in partisan polarization. In this paper, we examine to what extent the mode of fundraising, i.e., whether or not donations are made via fundraising events that facilitate personal contact between donors and politicians, may be driving these trends. We leverage novel data based on state-level campaign finance disclosures and individual-level Census data, as well as multiple nationally representative surveys to examine event- or non-event donors along a number of dimensions relevant for responsiveness and polarization. Preliminary results suggest that event donors are wealthier and donate more frequently than other donors. Moreover, they exhibit relatively centrist policy preferences. Further, event donors are better represented on an issue-by-issue basis by their members of Congress than either non-event donors or non-donors. The results speak to the effects of campaign finance on polarization and responsiveness. The results are consistent with event donors playing an important role in how campaign finance affects political outcomes.	NA

In particular, I study the effect of the Smart Voting campaign; the latter was launched by Alexi Navalny with the aim to coordinate voting for the strongest opponents of the United Russia in single-member districts. I concentrate on two factors that influence opposition voters’ behavior: the image of incumbent party invincibility and the ideological distance between a voter and the main contender of the dominant party on a ballot. To test my hypotheses, I run a conjoint survey experiment (n = 481) in the second-largest Russian city - Saint-Petersburg - in the run-up to the 2021 State Duma election in September 2021. The results strongly support the hypothesis about ideological distance, while evidence for the effect of the image of invincibility is very weak: respondents presented with information emphasizing the challenges the United Russia faced in the election do not seem to vote more strategically than those from the control group.

2023	1935	1935	Constituency Service and Personalism in Congress from the Gilded Age to the Depression Era	The paper proposed here—a chapter from an book-length project on the rise of personalism in the U.S. Congress from roughly 1880 to 1930—exploits new data from multiple sources. One is an original data set created from collections at the National Archives involving the Congressional Seed Distribution, a Department of Agriculture program that allowed MCs to send packets of plant seed to constituents at taxpayer expense, serving primarily advertising purposes. The other is a dataset drawn from the pension records of Civil War veterans. I employ these data to directly identify and analyze MC interactions with and actions on behalf of constituents. Additionally, the chapter traces macro-level changes in constituency service, linking them to the broader system-level changes that lie at the heart of the theoretical account advanced in the book. I show the effect that developments such as the professionalization of the bureaucracy and the electoral reforms that tied MCs more directly to voters rather than local party leaders had on the internal organization of Congress and the activities of its members.

2023	550	BO22	The Effect of Incumbents‘ Partisanship on the Formation of Party Identification	Party identification (PID) is a central concept for the explanation and prediction not only of electoral choices but also of issue attitudes and political perception. The traditional conception of PID attributes its formation mostly to citizens' primary socialisation by family and primary social groups. While it has often been debated in the literature whether PID really is an 'unmoved mover' or subject to feedback effects from the political performance of party candidates or their issue positions, this discussion has usually focussed on the national level. We complement this perspective in two ways: first, by looking at feedback effects that originate at the level of individual US states, and second, by looking at the socialisation effects of the partisanship of presidents and state governors. Using multilevel ordinal logit modelling applied to cumulated American Election Study data from 1958 to 1992, we show that even after controlling for parental PID and other predictors, the party not only of the US president but also of the state governor experienced during adolescence and early adulthood affects the formation of PID.

Values based and feminist approaches to tackling foreign policy problems such as immigration, conflict, and global poverty about in the Scottish Government’s policy statements. Overlooked is the public’s buy-in to a programme that proposes Scotland moving in a radically different direction in its conduct of international affairs should independence be attained. This paper analyses data from a unique survey designed to compare the foreign policy attitudes of Scottish and English respondents, with a purposively designed survey with a Scottish oversample to tap the authors’ longstanding core policy posture items with newer items to tap citizen attitudes towards the tenants of feminist foreign policy approaches. The paper will analyse whether the structure and distributions of foreign policy attitudes show cross-border differences, while determining the extent of public buy in towards feminist foreign policy approaches on both sides of Hadrian’s Wall.

2023	1254	BO23	Feminism as a cue	This paper analyzes whether feminism works as a cue that affects where people stand on gender issues. As feminism gains visibility in political and media agendas, it could be expected to work as a source cue similar to ideological or party identities. We use three experimental studies to test whether providing people with a feminist cue (information about feminists endorsing policy positions) affects where people stand on those issues, contingent on people’s attitudes towards feminism. Experiments are run in different countries (UK and Spain), deal with different issues (gender violence, surrogate pregnancies, gender quotas, and the use of niqabs and burkas) and vary on whether or not they offer frames and party cues together with feminist cues. We find that there are no significant cue effects for feminism. The paper discusses the reasons why, although feminism may refer to a bunch of highly salient gender issues, it does not work as a social identity that conditions where people position themselves in terms of policy options.

2023	1258	BO23	Why do women feel threatened by feminism?	Far right voting is often explained as a counter-reaction to cultural change, including to feminism. Given the aims of feminism, men should feel more threatened by feminism than women, which could explain their higher likelihood to vote for an anti-feminist far right party. However, individuals’ perceptions of feminism as a threat have seldom been measured in their own right. Using novel survey data on the case of Spain, we find that, contrary to expectations, women feel more threatened by feminism than men. The effect holds for material, symbolic, egotropic and sociotropic threat perceptions. We develop and test two mediation hypotheses to explain this finding. First, women generally have higher levels of threat perceptions and anxiety than men regarding various issues, including feminism. Second, women spend more time on house and care work, which they may not consider as adequately valued by feminism. Our results support these hypotheses, controlling for various factors, including party identification and feminist self-identification. The study confirms the ambivalent nature of social perceptions of feminism and highlights the difficulties of feminism in achieving large support among women.	NA
2023	1478	BO23	We did it: The legacies of female enfranchisement	The research on suffrage extension is incomplete because it does not include the process of women’s enfranchisement. Little is known about what this constitutive change has triggered regarding women’s attitudes, this research aims at filling this gap. I aim to capture the effect of female enfranchisement on women’s political and feminist attitudes at the individual level by drawing on research that focuses on the influence of impressionable years and research that contends that political opinions form throughout youth. This goal is challenging since, once women's voting rights are assured, the entire female population is treated, making it challenging to identify an appropriate counterfactual. Furthermore, it is challenging to disentangle between different causal paths. I attempt to overcome this issue using the case of the Spanish Second Republic. This case allows identifying and analysing those women who voted up until two times, lost their suffrage during the Franco regime, and regained it after democratisation. Hence, it captures not only the legacies of acquiring suffrage but also the consequences of losing it and living under a gender-based authoritarian regime.	NA
2023	1878	BO03	We march, she runs: Feminist movements and women's political representation	What is the effect of feminist grassroots mobilizations for women’s political representation? New research explores the impact of the U.S. Women’s March on women's descriptive representation. Yet, for a worldwide phenomenon, we ignore how the effect of feminist mobilizations on political representation travels to multiparty systems. This paper sheds light on this by focusing on the 2018 and 2019 Women’s Day protests in Spain, which gathered around five million people and witnessed unprecedented female mobilizations. Combining geographical data on protests and administrative data on candidate lists at the municipal level, we explore the effects of Women’s Day mobilizations on the selection of female politicians. Taking advantage of the intensity and geographic variation, we use a difference-in-differences design to examine protests' effects on party nominations of female candidates, their positioning on the lists - either as a front-runner or a second – and the mechanisms behind this. This paper contributes to the literature on social movements and political representation by presenting novel evidence on the different strategies that parties may incur when facing the salience of feminist movements.

2023	1067	BO24	Coeducation and Gender Norms	In recent years, we have seen a reduction of purely male and purely female spaces in advanced industrial societies. As mixed gender environments increase, how can we expect them to affect gender norms? To answer this question, we focus on the effects of the introduction of mixed gender education. We collect data on education reforms in European countries that enabled male and female coeducation. We then merge these data with individual-level data from the European Social Survey. To estimate the effect of coeducation on gender norms, we run regression discontinuity designs that compare cohorts nearly affected and nearly not affected by the reforms. Our findings suggest that coeducation had no effect on men’s views of gender equality, but it made women more conservative when it comes to female labor participation. Our results have implications for the set of policies that work, and do not work, for female empowerment and gender equality in advanced industrial democracies.	NA
2023	1616	BO24	The female losers of technological change and far-right voting. Resilient or simply unaddressed by far-right parties?	Being considered the losers of technological change, male industrial workers have turned to support far-right parties. Yet, although “female” routine occupations such as office clerks have shrunk similarly, female routine workers have not voted for the far-right as frequently as their male counterparts. The dominating explanation for this gendered voting pattern is a greater societal status loss among male routine workers. Our paper tests an alternative explanation, namely that male and female routine workers have been unequally addressed by far-right parties. Therefore, we ask the following question: Is the effect of technological change on far-right voting for female workers moderated by far-right parties? While most studies analyze national dynamics of party competition, research suggests that parties adjust their political campaigns to the local context. We test our theoretical arguments with a measure of local party strategy which is constructed from politicians’ social media data in Germany. These data are combined with GSOEP data and the established routine task intensity index and EU KLEMS data on ICT usage within industries as measures of technological change.	NA
2023	1975	BO24	Female Labour Market Participation and Gender Conservatism in Europe	This study examines how increased participation of women in the labor market affects the distribution of egalitarian gender attitudes in society. We argue that increased female labor market participation might foster conservative gender attitudes, because it triggers grievances for certain men and women. For men, increased female labor force participation intensifies competition in the labor market, especially among men who are already economically vulnerable (labor market competition channel). For women, increased female labor force participation might be also be threatening when women are financially dependent on men in their household and thus worry about the female labor market competition for men in their household household economics channel). We test these conjectures in two studies. The first study uses European Social Survey. The second study relies on panel data from Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany to better identify the mechanisms. We conclude that increased labor market competition of women generated a more conservative gender attitudes in Europe among men and women who are financially dependent on men.	NA
2023	367	BO24	Do Citizens Discriminate Against Women Political Leaders? Evidence From a 20-Country Conjoint Study	Due to the persistent underrepresentation of women in politics around the world, it would be logical to conclude that citizens discriminate against women running for office. However, the empirical evidence of gender bias is mixed. Whereas early research suggested that men do outperform women in the electoral sphere more recent work suggests that women and men perform equally well once party and incumbency are controlled for. Furthermore, most existing work is conducted in the United States or a select few other Western nations. To evaluate whether citizens prefer male leaders, we conducted a 20-country comparative study, employing a conjoint design asking participants to choose between political candidates varying on characteristics such as gender, occupational background, age, number of children etc. The design allows us to estimate the average effect of gender on candidate preference, while simultaneously measuring effects of other relevant candidate attributes. Additionally, we test the potential moderating effect of macro-level variables like current levels of women’s representation in parliament, as well as the moderating effect of respondent-level variables such as sexist attitudes and political ideology.

2023	456	BO24	Home economics courses and gendered domestic labor	There is a persistent gender gap in domestic labor. One driver of this gap is that children’s experiences with domestic labor might be gendered. This raises the question whether interventions that familiarize both young men and women with some of the basics of housework, such as home economics classes in school, can increase their contribution to housework later in their lives and thereby reduce the domestic labor gender gap. We shed new light on this question by leveraging the quasi-random variation in home economics classes across Swiss gymnasiums. Due to budget cuts, home economics classes were cut in some schools in 2004, and reintroduced after a popular initiative a few years later. Drawing on a survey and student registry information about where and when respondents graduated from gymnasium, we compare self-reported housework time of students who went to gymnasium between 1999 and 2018 with and without home economics. Initial findings indicate that home economics classes reduce the domestic labor gender gap. These causal effects underscore the importance of this educational intervention for gender equality.	NA
2023	1617	BO25	Vox and Frente Nacional: Examining historical patterns of support for the right and far-right in Spain	The far-right vote has already been studied from various angles. One is the effect of geographic circumstances on voters. Through the rural-urban divide, researchers try to understand the factors that make rural voters more likely to vote for the far-right, linking them in most cases, to the consequences of globalization. However, little attention has been paid to cultural circumstances that are stable for generations in these areas. This paper fills this gap by using an innovative perspective: the effect of historical legacies in an unexplored case like Spain. The lack of industrialization and the support for Frente Nacional during the Second Republic in agrarian rural areas helped maintain traditional values that explain the vote for VOX nowadays. The mixed-methods approach of this paper, using both new municipal-level historical data and qualitative interviews, allows us to understand how the transmission of values has been made through generations. Results support the main hypothesis of the paper: Rural-agrarian voters who live in a municipality that supported FN during the Second Republic have a higher probability to support VOX nowadays.	NA
2023	554	BO25	Commemorating Victims of Past Atrocities in Neighborhoods Decreases Far-Right Support Over Time	Does public remembrance of past atrocities lead to decreased support for far-right parties today? Initiatives commemorating past atrocities often aim to affect political behavior in support of democracy and pluralism in the present. Yet, little empirical evidence exists whether that happens. In this study, we examine if exposure to local memorials that commemorate victims of atrocities reduces support for far-right parties. Our empirical case is the Stolpersteine counter-memorial in Berlin, Germany. It commemorates victims and survivors of Nazi persecution in front of their last freely chosen place of residence. We employ various analytical strategies from time-series cross-sectional analyses to a discontinuity design using a novel panel dataset that matches the location and date of placement of new Stolpersteine with election results from seven elections (2013-2021) at the level of polling station areas. We find that, on average, the presence of Stolpersteine is associated with a 0.96%-point decrease in the far-right vote share in the following election. Our study suggests that counter-memorials reduce local far-right support. The finding demonstrates how social representations of history can impact political behavior in the present.	NA
2023	814	PE19	Remnants of Fascism: Transitional Justice in postwar Germany	What are the effects of mass transitional justice programs on new democracies? After the Second World War, millions of Germans were questioned about their political past by courts. I document how denazification shaped the emerging political landscape in postwar Germany. Using three sources of plausibly exogenous variation in the extent of denazification, I find that denazification reduced the demand for nationalist politics. This difference is observed in neighboring and otherwise similar municipalities (i) across Allied occupation zones, (ii) across court-districts, and (iii) within districts. Tracing the effect over time, support for nationalist politics moves as party platforms evolve.	NA
2023	990	BO25	The Holocaust, Culture of Memory, and the Radical Right in Germany	How does the Holocaust as a unique act of genocide and the contestation of culture of memory continue to interact with current electoral politics in Germany? This paper aims to improve our understanding of how different framings of historical guilt and continued responsibility influence citizens’ views of the past, attitudes to outgroups, and voting decisions. It relies on a survey experiment based on a nationally representative sample in which respondents are exposed to vignettes outlining different framings of guilt and continued responsibility for the Holocaust. The vignette texts are adapted from excerpts of speeches by Holocaust survivors and politicians from across the political spectrum on Germany’s culture of memory and the need to remember. Exploring how citizens react to these different narratives will help us to analyse how different societal narratives, policies, and political contexts interact with individual characteristics in shaping reactions to different framings of historical guilt and continued responsibility and make citizens susceptibly to revisionist accounts relativizing the past, for example by radical right parties.

2023	1823	BO26	The legacies of historical events on political engagement: Comparative Quantitative Evidence from Western Europe, 1973–2002	Historical events are regarded as moments that exert lasting legacies on sustained political engagement, but this assertion awaits empirical verification. Previous studies use case-study designs of limited generalizability and have not directly studied how events affect everyday political engagement. This investigation tackles these issues by conducting a quantitative comparative investigation on event’s impacts on everyday political engagement. Through exhaustive historiographical analysis, I identify 43 eventful periods for 5 West European countries across the twentieth-century. Using the results of 360 statistical models analyzing 30 years of survey data, I assess the empirical association between cohort-level variables of historical exposure to each of these events and interpersonal political discussion, a behavioral measure of daily political engagement. I find that most events are significant predictors of political discussion, but they are heterogeneous in the magnitude and direction of the impacts they exert. Using an original database on events characteristics, I identify associations between these heterogeneities and the recency, transformative nature, and rallying capacity of an event, and introduce theoretical propositions aimed at understanding these previously uncharted associations.

2023	1874	BO26	The impact of historical events on everyday political engagement: difference-in-difference quasi experimental evidence from the German Reunification period	Previous studies have shown that historical events have political attitudinal impacts, we don’t know if they also can reshape how the levels and social distribution of political engagement. This investigation seeks to shed light on this issue. I argue that due to age and socioeconomic differences in political interest and the degree to which people use environmental cues for political inference making, historical events produce effects on political engagement that are segmented across the life cycle: they are large and socioeconomically equalizing for young adults, and moderate and unequalizing for other ages. I find empirical support for this hypothesis by analyzing variations between West Germany and France in how age and socioeconomic attributes performed as regressors of interpersonal political discussion, a behavioral indicator of daily political engagement, before and during German Reunification (Nov ’89-Dec-’90). I develop and use an original quantitative indicator of historical contingency to show this comparison approximates quasi-experimental conditions that tackle validity issues that remain pervasive in even-based research.

2023	1883	BO26	Remembering the Past, Taking Action, and Political Mobilization	Remembering past atrocities has been discussed as an effective way not to repeat past mistakes and improve current intergroup relations, for both groups that are related and unrelated to the past. However, research also highlights that when people are reminded of past and current atrocities, they feel helpless as what they can do is limited. In this well-powered field-in-the-lab experiment in Germany, we will examine the effects of real-world intervention where people contribute to building an online archive about the victims of Nazi persecution. Taking action related to the atrocities increases participative self-efficacy and intentions to mobilize for a society free of prejudice. In addition to a pure control condition, we also compare our treatment to an exposure to past atrocities condition. This way we can highlight the importance of giving people options to take actions related to atrocities in addition to reminding them about the atrocities so that intergroup relations are improved. This research has critical implications for the literature on political mobilization and prejudice reduction.	NA
2023	614	BO26	Communist legacies and socially conservative attitudes	How do communist legacies affect contemporary views about socio-cultural issues, like immigration and gender norms, in Central and Eastern Europe? While there is a burgeoning literature on the long-term impact of socialization under authoritarian regimes on a range of democratic, economic and left-right views, we know less about its impact on attitudes to socio-cultural issues. I theorize that exposure to communist regimes is likely to reinforce social conformity (particularly in contexts of high levels of past repression), which should in turn generate over the longer-term greater social conservatism, including more opposition to foreigners and less support for gender equality norms. I test this hypothesis using attitudinal data from the World Values Study and the European Social Survey, coupled with indicators from the V-DEM dataset and World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Preliminary results provide partial support for these theoretical claims. The findings from this study can contribute to our understanding of the long-term determinants of attitudes to socio-cultural issues in Europe.	NA
2023	1531	BO27	Party Competition and Unequal Participation in Europe	Traditionally, political science has deemed unequal electoral participation a serious sign of democratic malaise with negative consequences for political representation and system legitimacy. This paper contributes to this established research agenda by scrutinising the drivers behind the turnout gaps in different population strata in terms of education and income. It does so by leveraging data from the World Political Cleavages and Inequality Database (WPID) and the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP). The paper sheds light on the effects of party competition-related features in boosting education- and income-based turnout gaps, emphasising the role of party system polarisation and party salience on economic and cultural issues. Overall, the findings of the paper have important implications for both political research on unequal participation and party competition.	NA
2023	1933	BO27	Polarization and Cooperation: An experiment	This paper presents a conjoint experiment in Spain and United Kingdom that examines the effects of affective polarization on individuals' willingness to cooperate with an opponent partisan. In the experiment, participants were presented with a scenario in which they could either cooperate or not cooperate with individuals with different random characteristics, and a defined partisanship. Their choices were analyzed in relation to their level of affective polarization. The results of the experiment indicate that affective polarization can significantly decrease individuals' willingness to cooperate with an opponent partisan, even when doing so would be in their best interest. This finding adds to the growing body of research on the negative effects of affective polarization, and suggests that efforts to reduce affective polarization may be beneficial for fostering cooperation and collaboration in society.

2023	239	BO27	Taking the heat out of politics: How cross-partisan discussions improve political debate	As politics becomes increasingly polarized, there is mounting concern that people are less willing to talk and listen to each other across political divides. While evidence suggests that cross-party interactions can reduce polarization, we know much less about how such interactions influence the nature of political discussion. This paper examines the effect of cross-party contact on the content of political discussion using a lab-in-the-field experiment in Britain. Building on insights from social psychology, we argue that people discussing politics with likeminded partisans will be more emotive, whereas cross-partisan discussions will encourage greater use of perspective-taking and reason. We test these propositions by randomly assigning partisans to discuss a divisive political policy with either co-partisans or out-partisans in a non-deliberative discussion setting. Using supervised machine learning to analyse the discussion content, we find that people taking part in cross-party group discussions are less likely to use negative emotive rhetoric and more likely to engage with the evidence and argument. These findings demonstrate the ways in which cross-party discussion enable people to discuss even divisive political issues in a reasoned manner.	NA
2023	388	BO27	Does School Debating Reduce Vulnerability to Misinformation? A Randomized Control Trial in Poland	The idea that debating enhances political knowledge and critical thinking has beenentertained by scholars of democracy for a long time. Given recent concern about a crisisof misinformation, we explore the idea that by training analytical skills, debating makespeople less vulnerable to misinformation and conspiracy thinking. In a pre-registeredfield experiment, we recruited high-school students in 18 schools in Poland and randomly assigned them to either a debating workshop or a control condition. Beforeand after the workshop period, we asked students to indicate their belief in a set ofnews headlines (half of which were true, half false) and also measured their degree ofconspiratorial thinking. We find that debating increases the accuracy of beliefs regardingnews headlines, while reducing conspiracy thinking. These findings point to a greatpotential of school debating, which occurs naturally in many educational contexts and iseasily scalable.	NA
2023	846	BO27	Affective partisanship versus heterogeneous political networks	Can heterogeneous political networks contain outpartisan hostility? And to what extent does partisanship drive the formation of social relationships? These dynamics are intertwined: exposure to heterogeneous social networks may prevent outpartisan hate, however, especially in a highly polarized political climate, individuals may proactively avoid interactions with outparty members, thus reducing their exposure to alternative viewpoints. To answer these questions, we ran a two-wave survey coupled with several experiments in the US. The survey measures outpartisan hate and the amount of close and casual relationships individuals have with outpartisans. It also conducts three tests to measure network selection: a pairwise comparison, a conjoint experiment and a competence game. Exploiting the November 2022 House Elections as an exogenous source of partisanship, we compare the same participants’ answers between polarized and calm political times. Preliminary findings show that participants in both close and casual heterogeneous networks are indeed less polarized than those in homogeneous networks. They are also less driven by partisanship in their selection of social relationships. These findings suggest that interpartisan animosity can be contained when outpartisans interact and form relationships.	NA
2023	1289	BO28	Exogenous and Endogenous Identities and Political Preferences: Evidence from a Countrywide Natural Experiment in Thailand	Researchers from across the social sciences contend that identities critically shape political attitudes and behaviors. Despite decades of scholarship suggesting the critical influence of identities establishing the causal effect of identities on political preferences is extremely difficult because identities are -- either by choice or external force -- endogenous. We examine the causal relationship between identity and political preferences through a countrywide natural experiment in Thailand on the basis of Thailand's color identities, which are exogenously assigned at birth. We conducted two large-scale surveys in Thailand that allowed us to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous sources of color identification. We find a statistically significant effect of endogenous identities on political attachments and choices. However, we do not find a statistically significant effect of the same color identity when this is derived exogenously. This study serves as a clean test of exogenous identities on political preferences in a real-world political setting and sheds light on the theoretical and empirical relevance of distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous identities for politics.

2023	17	BO28	Why and when does descriptive representation matter?: Bringing in the effect of group identity	The representation of social groups in democratic institutions, also defined as descriptive representation, is crucial for people’s attitudes towards these institutions. By sending cues of improved deliberation in the interest of social groups within society, descriptive representation affects how well voters perceive themselves represented by these institutions and how fair they perceive the process of decision-making. For instance, the degree to which women are represented signals improved deliberation in the interest of women to voters (male and female). Previous studies have investigated the effect of descriptive representation on perceptions of representation and procedures. However, in sum, empirical findings remain inconclusive. They do not allow us to answer the question of when and why descriptive representation is relevant for evaluations of institutions. I answer these questions by connecting theories of representation and group identity theory. The degree to which voters feel subjective group belonging and status they perceive these groups to have within society predicts how they perceive and process collective descriptive representation. To test this, I collect original survey data, incl an online conjoint experiment, in Germany and UK.	NA
2023	1844	BO28	The Interaction of Authority Support and Intergroup Contact	Intergroup contact, that is bringing members of different groups together under certain conditions, is one of the most studied prejudice-reduction interventions. However, intergroup contact does not occur in a vacuum — even if that is rarely made explicit. Rather it is typically embedded in an institutional environment in which support of positive intergroup interactions is low, high or a mixture of both. Allport, the father of intergroup contact theory, postulated that “the effect of contact is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional support (i.e., by law, custom, or local atmosphere)”, and the few existing studies on the topic suggest that he was right. This study examines the role of authority support from various institutions in intergroup contact (i.e., government, business, and church) through a priming experiment and a conjoint experiment in the US. The results highlight the importance of authority support for participating in intergroup contact events and perceptions of the effectiveness of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice. This study contributes to the literature on the necessary conditions for intergroup contact to be effective.	NA
2023	674	BO28	Accumulating Differences Across the Political Life Cycle: Socialisation, Resources and the Mobilisation to Vote Among Immigrant-Origin and Native Voters	Why are immigrant-origin voter groups less likely to turnout in established democracies? Previous studies already demonstrated that the explanation models underlying individual voting participation are the same across immigrant-origin and native voters, but could not explain why the turnout gap between both groups persists. This paper integrates theoretical notions of explanations for turnout and identifies three central explanations for these group differences: (a) socialisation experiences (immigrant-origin voters are less socialised into political activity when their parents are less integrated politically), (b) resources (immigrant-origin voters have fewer resources that matter for voting, such as education, political knowledge) and (c) mobilisation (parties mobilise voters differently). Using a novel data set from the IMGES II, conducted in the city of Duisburg during the 2021 Bundestag election, we test a three-phase model of the political life cycle on random samples of immigrant-origin groups and natives. We find differences between voters for all three phases, during the time of politically coming of age, the period of cumulating relevant resources and, finally, during the run-up to the election through exposure to mobilizing efforts by parties.

2023	1	1	Life pension and parliamentarian effort	Many democracies grant their parliamentarians access to an exclusive pension system. While there has been much debate about the financial cost of such schemes, little attention has been paid to their effect on parliamentary effort. We propose a model that captures the two main features of life pension schemes: i) the pension amount increases with seniority, and ii) age determines parliamentarians' eligibility. Our model highlights heterogeneous incentives to exert parliamentarian effort: introducing a life pension decreases effort of eligible parliamentarians with high seniority and increases the effort of all other parliamentarians. We test this model using the introduction of the life pension in Italy in 1955 where the eligibility of parliamentarians depends on their age and the amount accumulated depends on their seniority. Our empirical results show that the prospects of accumulating a higher pension stimulates parliamentarians to exert more effort, especially when parliamentarians are not eligible. In contrast, eligible parliamentarians face a trade-off between accumulating further benefits or enjoying the life pension straight away. Senior eligible parliamentarians decrease their effort while all other parliamentarians maintain or increase their effort.	NA
2023	1000	BO29	Grandparenthood and solidarity with future generations	The generational contract is under pressure in ageing democracies where expectations that the next generation will be better off than their parents are declining. The family is the sphere where people most frequently interact across generations and personal experiences in this context can influence support for other - and future – generations. However, the role of family ties in fostering inter-generational solidarity has rarely been studied within public opinion research, especially not in causal-oriented studies. This paper investigate solidarity with future generations, specifically related to climate action and long-term sustainability of the welfare state, among middle-aged and old adults, and how family relations to grandchildren inform such opinions. It does so using a large-scale survey experiment priming familial roles to different degrees, fielded among a representative sample of people aged 55 or older in Denmark. The paper contributes with knowledge on the link between family ties and inter-generational solidarity and, most importantly, with causal evidence for whether family ties matter for willingness to prioritise solving long-term issues.

2023	1579	BO29	Regionalism as a Generational Process in the Post-Industrial Heartlands: a Focus on Wallonia	For the past six years, the Walloon regional government in Belgium has been conducting economic and green energy projects aimed at improving the region’s economic decline since the 1950s as a result of the transition of dependence on the industrial economy to the service sector. A transition to a more sustainable energy efficient region with the goal of creating more jobs to combat unemployment is depicted in the Regional Policy Direction, a five year plan from 2019-2024. Literature on regionalism is becoming more prevalent regarding the discussion of post-industrial regions and new economic projects with the goal of becoming more autonomous. Will economic advancement plans trigger a growing support for more regional autonomy in Wallonia? This discussion aims to address the less obvious and more compelling Walloon case of regionalism as Belgian regional conflict has been historically and currently centered around the region of Flanders with the dominant far-right party Vlaams Belang calling for Belgian succession and autonomy from Wallonia.

2023	211	BO29	Economic vs. Generational inequality: A survey experiment of intra- and intergenerational cleavages in support for climate change mitigation policies	Climate change policies often aim to change consumer behaviour by increasingthe price tag of certain goods and services. Although this is often touted as one ofthe more effective ways of combatting climate change, it is not withoutits disadvantages: they tend to carry a disproportionally higher burden (in termsof financial cost) to those with lower wages. These policies can either exasperateexisting income inequalities or contribute to generating new ones. Meanwhile,refraining from engaging with climate mitigation policies will incur other detrimentalsocietal costs: the financial burden and the struggles future generations will faceif nothing is done. We examine this trade-off between the immediate inequalitycitizens face from climate mitigation policies (in terms of carbon trading) vs. thelong-term generational inequalities future generations will face. We assess this trade-off using a between-subjects survey experiment, fielded among German citizens(N=6000).	NA

Proposed answers are far-reaching. Yet in recent years cautionary voices have become louder: not all relations between material circumstances and political attitudes can be interpreted as a direct consequence of these circumstances. This is because (1) pre-adult experiences with socio-economic disadvantage, (2) shocks early in individuals' labour market trajectories, as well as (3) exposure to economic risks throughout individuals' labour market trajectories can impact the attitudes of those who experience an economic shock, next to (4) the shock itself. This article highlights the need to disentangle these processes theoretically and empirically. In theoretical terms, these four processes differ regarding the underlying models of political socialization over the life-cycle. The analyses highlight the crucial role of labour market experiences early in life - process 2) - since only younger age groups adjust their redistributive attitudes in response to unemployment. These results stem from age group specific analyses of the Dutch LISS panel from 2008 to 2021 using traditional and more advanced fixed effects models that control for time-constant and dynamic unemployment risk factors.

2023	1152	BO30	Housing Wealth and Political Efficacy	Housing wealth plays a central role in accounting for levels of wealth inequality and wealth is associated with important outcomes net of other socioeconomic predictors. Yet, housing wealth has so far been neglected in analyses of political efficacy. We argue that housing wealth is associated with higher efficacy by providing insurance against negative life events and fostering local rootedness. Using data from the UKHLS and two original surveys conducted in England and Wales, we document a sizeable positive association of housing wealth with political efficacy. We show that this effect is driven by those who own their house outright, whereas homeowners with a mortgage are more similar to renters, reflecting the pressure of mortgage payments counteracting the insurance function. We furthermore investigate experimentally whether informing respondents about house price inequality or overall wealth inequality affects their efficacy. Our pre-registered hypotheses stipulate that learning about high inequality should reduce efficacy. However, the information treatments show no effect, suggesting that political efficacy is not easily manipulated with information about inequality. Overall, the paper illustrates the importance of wealth for political efficacy research.	NA
2023	1299	BO00	Mobility, Socialization and Redistribution	Beliefs in equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility are increasingly popular as an explanation for redistribution preferences. Some individuals (even if they are poor) may be more willing to accept inequality as a result of a fair meritocratic process and high mobility. Others (even when they are rich) may support redistribution if they believe inequality to be the result of an unfair system and low mobility. In this paper we focus on the role of socialisation. We conduct an original survey to explore several questions: Does the transmission of preferences through socialisation influence perceptions, attitudes, and preferences? Yo what extent relative to other predictors? And through which channels?	NA
2023	601	BO30	A life-course approach to political preference formation across social classes	Despite a recent resurgence of interest in social class in political science, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to political differences between classes. Implementing a longitudinal approach, we address how class conflict in political preferences crystallizes throughout individuals’ life course. In doing so, we distinguish two crucial stages of socialization: during post-secondary education and on the job, and we adjudicate when class differences in political preferences become more marked and consolidated. Are class preferences a direct consequence of individuals’ economic prospects and experiences on the job? Or are divergences in class preferences a mere consequence of citizens self-selecting into occupations? We elaborate on the conceptual differences between the processes of selection and socialization, and address these questions empirically using UK and Swiss panel data. Our first analyses focusing on socialization in the job and entrance into a class location provide little support for socialization at this stage, as class differences in issue positions are often at least as large prior to entering occupation. This research advances debates about social class as a relevant milieu of political socialization.	NA
2023	776	BO30	Upward mobility and gender in the knowledge economy	Scholars of political behavior have recently paid much attention to experiences of downward mobility in increasingly knowledge-based societies, especially among older, lower-educated voters. However, educational expansion and changing occupational structures have also created opportunities for upward mobility among younger professionals – unprecedentedly so for women. This paper studies how men and women make sense of upward mobility (in combination with societal trends around them) and how this influences their political attitudes and behavior. We explore the importance of different reference points for men and women (e.g. comparisons to mother’s versus father’s/parents’ status), whether they interpret labor market success differently, and how upward social mobility may differentially relate to political attitudes (including gender-related ones) for men and women. Empirically, we draw on multiple original surveys fielded in various European countries between 2021 and 2023, which include objective and subjective measures of social mobility as well as attitudinal and electoral outcomes. If upward mobility differentially shapes the politics of (younger, educated) men and women, this may be a key element to ongoing changes in the electoral dynamics across advanced democracies.	NA
2023	1048	BO31	Left behind and Voting Right: Residential Sorting and Populist Radical Right Support in Eastern Germany	Growing support for populist radical right parties in declining areas, particularly in post-communist societies, has often been blamed on the strain of economic decline, failure to instill democratic norms, and xenophobia. We put forward another explanation: Massive population losses in these areas imply that many voters who would have been least likely to support anti-system parties have left, leaving behind increasingly disaffected remainers. We exploit the natural experiment of German reunification, after which 16 million eastern Germans were suddenly free to move to wealthier western Germany, to show that large net outflows of population predict high levels of populist radical right support. Using unique administrative data as well as panel survey data, we estimate to what extent this pattern is due to those who left being politically different from those who stayed and those who stayed changing their political attitudes as a result. We conclude that if leavers had remained, the vote share obtained by the populist radical right in those regions would have been substantially lower.	NA
2023	1545	BO31	“Levelling up communities”: How place-based policies affect political attitudes and behaviour- The Case of Germany	Amid the rise of territorial inequalities and anti-mainstream support, politicians have increasingly called for place-based policies to revitalise deprived neighbourhoods through economic investment and social cohesion projects. Advocates of such policies argue that they are likely to reduce spatial disparities that caused radical right support in more economically deprived areas. However, little is known about whether, and if so how, such policies affect political attitudes and behaviour. This paper aims to assess the impact of urban regeneration policies on individuals’ political interest, sense of external efficacy, political participation and/or party identification. To do so, we focus on the ‘Social City Programme’ in Germany which is an urban regeneration policy that combines economic investment and social cohesion projects to boost local economies and increase civic and political engagement. The German panel data allows us to compare various political attitudes and behaviour of individuals that receive this programme with similar individuals that did not receive it since its implementation in 1999. This paper provides important insights into whether place-based policies are successful at promoting political participation and curbing anti-mainstream support.	NA
2023	156	BO31	Estimating the Geographic Scope of Electoral Responses to Refugees	What are the electoral consequences of refugee inflows to developed democracies? In this research note, we shed new light on this question by estimating the geographic scope at which the local presence of refugees affects voting behavior. Focusing on Germany in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis, we combine precinct-level electoral returns with the geocoded street addresses of refugee housing facilities. Using a difference-in-differences design within large cities, we show that refugee exposure sharply increased far-right voting among citizens living in close proximity to refugees. However, these effects are highly localized: on average, no substantive effect can be detected among voters living 300 meters or more from refugee accommodation. We further establish the generalizability of this pattern across German municipalities using census grid data. Our findings demonstrate how the substantive conclusions of quasi-experimental designs can be affected by the geographic level at which treatment exposure is measured.	NA
2023	1950	BO31	Left or Right? The Spatial Dynamics of Anti-Establishment Support	The strong and rising support for populist radical parties has caused upheavals across European political landscapes. Most studies to date, however, have focused on the ascendance of populist radical right (RR) parties, overlooking other expressions of mainstream party disaffection and abandonment, especially on the radical left (RL). Specifically, despite growing interest in geographic divides in support for radical anti-establishment parties, prior research has predominantly examined the local contexts under which voters turn to the RR. Our study deepens understanding of the conditions under which populist anti-establishment sentiments translate into support for the RR in some localities and the RL in others. We advance a structural economic argument to explain how space and place structure support for RR and RL parties. We posit that what distinguishes RR from RL strongholds and voters is their relative economic and labor market conditions and how they evolve over time. To make our case, we turn to France - a country with long-standing presence of radical parties - and examine the dynamics of electoral support for RR and RL candidates in French presidential elections between 1995 - 2022.

2023	123	BO32	It’s Not the Economy: Explaining the Effects of Media Coverage on Attitudes Towards Immigration	While previous research has linked media coverage and public concern about immigration, understanding of the reasons for this concern is limited. Utilizing group threat theory, this article examines the effects of increased media coverage on realistic and symbolic threat perceptions towards immigration, and whether effects may differ by socioeconomic status. I first evaluate the frequency of media coverage of migration using the MigPress corpus of German newspapers. Using mixed multilevel models, this data is linked with longitudinal information on the salience of the migration topic from the German Socio-Economic Panel and greater detail on perceptions of symbolic and realistic threat from the European Social Survey. Results demonstrate that while media salience increases concerns about immigration, these concerns are mainly due to symbolic rather than realistic threat perceptions, indicating that the relationship between economic concerns and anti-immigration attitudes may be overrated. Media coverage increases concerns most for the highest social classes, possibly because they consume more newspaper content. These findings bring us a step closer towards better understanding how media coverage can affect the attitudes of social groups in divergent ways.	NA
2023	1292	BO32	Information control and online engagement during the war in Ukraine	The war in Ukraine takes place both on the battlefields as well as the information space. A lot of attention has been given to “information warfare” in the form of production and distribution of propaganda and disinformation on social media. However, the struggle for “truth” also takes place through information control – both in Russia as well as liberal democracies. Using data from YouTube, one of the most popular social media in the world, we examine changes in commenting engagement following the Russian censorship laws as well as YouTube’s own effort to curb Russian state-affiliated propaganda. With the empirical results, we hope to contribute to the ongoing debate within the broader public as well as censorship scholarship on the effectiveness of online bans in the context of international conflict.

2023	1377	BO32	Ready or not. National Identity, Vote Choice, and Mass Media: Evidence from Germany.	National identity has been suspected to explain far-right vote choices. Paradoxically, while national identity is rather stable and latent, far-right voting is far more volatile. The `activation hypothesis’ offers an explanation for how identities become behaviorally relevant. It is assumed that right-wing political elites in particular exploit the increasing salience of migration-related public discourses in their campaigns and thus activate national identities for electoral decision-making. Arguably, the mere presence of migration-related news in the mass media may serve as a situational trigger for thinking about national in-group/out-group boundaries and thus increase the relevance of national identities for voting decisions. Drawing on Identity Theory and Social Identity Theory, I investigate whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through migration-related issue salience in mass media. In doing so, this paper is the first one to use panel survey data linked with media content to test this activation hypothesis for Germany.	NA
2023	1766	BO32	The Information Environment and Perceptions of Parties' Ideological Positions	While we know quite a bit about how individual-level factors affect citizens’ knowledge of party positions, less is known about the role the information environment plays for perceptions. In this paper, we argue that for citizens to learn about parties' issue positions, they have to be exposed to a sufficient amount of political information and information should be unbiased. The implication of our argument is that citizens are better informed about parties’ ideological positions in election time, but that this information effect is conditional on a free media environment. Using the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data and leveraging variation in the timing of interview-taking, we show that citizens are better informed about parties’ left-right positions close to election time. However, this effect only holds in high media freedom settings. Our findings draw attention to the important role that the information environment plays for voter perceptions.	NA

Research on militancy in other contexts demonstrates that the viability of extremist movements depends in part on the tolerance of the populations in which they operate. To assess conditions in the United States, we employ endorsement experiments to overcome reporting bias and find that respondents who credulously consume right-wing media are more tolerant of militant right-wing organizations. To evaluate changes over time, we fielded identical experiments in 2020 and 2022, finding that opposition to militant right-wing extremism declined, but with substantial regional variation. The implication is that the polarized media environment may reducing opposition to extremist organizations in ways that could contribute to future instability.	NA
2023	1204	BO33	How should politicians compensate citizens threatened by international trade?	Do people prefer protectionism or compensation when confronted with the distributional effects of trade? Central to the embedded liberalism thesis is that open economies will compensate citizens losing out as a consequence of competition from international trade. With political parties – particularly on the radical right – mobilising on protectionism, it is worth asking whether the compensation schemes of embedded liberalism can still work. This is particularly pressing because we know relatively little about the form citizens would prefer such compensation schemes to take. We expect people prefer protection over compensation if they personally lose from trade, but prefer compensation over protection if other people in society lose from trade. Our research design focuses on unique survey data from Germany, Ireland, Spain and Sweden in which we embed a pre-registered experiment that manipulates the scenarios surrounding increases in import flows and the steps politicians can take to address them. Our results illuminate the relative importance of education and region-specific import competition on preferences for political responses to international trade. This helps us to unpack the complexities beneath the trade protectionist/liberalization dichotomy.	NA
2023	398	BO33	Field of education and voting on the GALTAN divide	This paper investigates the causal connection between education, gender, and support for green and radical nationalist (or TAN) parties. It proposes a theory that places at its core the substantive field of education for conditioning a person’s partisanship on the GALTAN divide, which has as its extremes an opposition between green and TAN parties. It shows that the effect of level of education, occupation, and gender on voting can be informed by knowing a person’s field of education.	NA
2023	429	BO33	Educational Networks, Social Closure, and Political Divides	Education is widely recognized as structuring emerging political divides between the new left and the far right (Stubager 2009; Häusermann and Kriesi 2015; Hooghe and Marks 2018; Abou-Chadi and Hix 2021; Marks et al. 2022). However, there is ongoing uncertainty about the mechanism through which the education cleavage operates, particularly in the absence of mobilizing organizations. We fielded a survey in Germany in October 2022 (to be followed by Switzerland and the UK) to explore the hypothesis that patterns of social segregation by education create social networks which foster common identities, political attitudes, and voting behavior. Our preliminary evidence suggests the educational composition of social networks plays a role in consolidating key aspects of an emerging cleavage.	NA
2023	638	BO33	Without Roots: How Olive Grove Extermination Strengthened the Far Right in Italy	We examine the electoral consequences of a sudden economic disruption of traditional forms of agriculture. We specifically focus the outbreak of the bacterium Xylella Fastidiosa in the Southern Italian region of Apulia, one of Europe's leading olive oil-producing region, in 2014 which exterminated centuries-old olive groves. By exploiting geographic variation in the spread of the disease and georeferenced municipal-level data, we use a difference-in-differences design to quantify the economic disruption associated with the spread of Xylella Fastidiosa and its electoral consequences. The disease generated an average loss of 1 per cent of yearly post-tax income per capita in infected municipalities. This economic disruption had important political consequences: far right parties gained an excess vote share of 3.7 percentage points in affected areas due to increases in turnout and an electoral loss of left parties. The vote shares of the regional incumbent, a large left-wing coalition responsible for managing the disaster and administering relief, remained unaffected. We combine a machine-learning approach and qualitative fieldwork in purposefully selected municipalities to identify the community- and individual-level mechanisms that underlie our findings.	NA
2023	727	BO33	Electoral competition, public issue salience and far-right success in Western and Eastern Europe	Recent studies have shown that far-right parties’ success in Western Europe is associated with the high public salience of European integration. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, redistributive preferences are associated with support for Far-Right parties. Yet, little is known about the electoral implications of changes in public issue salience in Eastern versus Western Europe when multiple issues are juxtaposed simultaneously, including the overarching left-right dimension and three specific issue dimensions, economic redistribution, immigration, and EU integration. Based on the distribution of voters’ preferences in the multidimensional space, we argue theoretically and demonstrate empirically that (1) in Eastern Europe far-right parties gain votes when the salience of economic redistribution is high and the salience of EU integration is low, (2) in Western Europe Far-Right parties can gain votes when the salience of economic redistribution is low and the salience of EU integration and immigration are high. Our findings have important implications for the study of electoral competition, parties’ campaign strategies, and voting behavior.	NA
2023	1080	1080	Does Activating Moral Thinking Exacerbate Political Division?	Research has repeatedly shown that citizens tend to overestimate attitudinal divisions in society and between political camps. We propose that engaging in moral thinking—i.e., making judgments about whether other people are in the “right” or in the “wrong”—exacerbates misperceptions of division. This is so because the black-and-white logic of moral thinking leads individuals to experience diverging opinions as more fundamental and consequential. We study this hypothesis on the case of immigration; a topic considered to be highly polarizing. Embedding a survey experiment in countries with high and low levels of actual polarization around immigration, we randomly assign respondents to a question-as-treatment intended to trigger moral thinking about their attitudinal in- or out-group. We then examine whether the activation of moral thinking leads respondents to overestimate divisions around immigration in society. In addition, we examine whether activated moral thinking, through heightened (mis)perceptions of division, drives respondents to take more extreme immigration stances. The study contributes new knowledge on the consequences of moral judgments in politics and carries important implications for understanding the drivers of societal division.	NA
2023	1275	BO34	Political Polarization and the States of Moral Rhetoric	The recent surge in political polarization in the United States has coincided with increasingly moralized elite rhetoric that further differentiates party lines. However, little is known about the direction of this relationship: did polarization induce moral differentiation in political rhetoric or—vice versa—did changing moral rhetoric precede the growing partisan divide? We examine this question by leveraging a unique dataset containing all state-of-state speeches given by American governors on a yearly or bi-yearly basis since each given state entered the Union to explore the dynamic relationship between partisan polarization and elite moral rhetoric. Using these speeches has two advantages. First, covering a long time period enables us to explore temporal dynamics between polarization and moral rhetoric far beyond the scope of previous research. Secondly, they allow us to investigate how moral language itself has evolved in non-polarized contexts, which can provide important insights into potential scope conditions such as the role of economic development and inequality.

2023	1750	BO34	Trusting the Rich to ‘Tax the Rich’? Voter Inferences from Candidate Affluence	This paper investigates how information about candidate affluence shapes voters’ decision-making at the ballot box. Challenging existing arguments that voters prefer affluent to low-income candidates on competence grounds, I argue that voters use information on affluence to infer candidate self-interest and evaluate the credibility of candidates’ policy promises on redistribution. I hypothesize that populist voters are particularly likely to rely on perceived self-interest as a heuristic for credibility. Evidence from a candidate-choice conjoint experiment lends partial support to my argument. While voters dislike affluent candidates for office across the board, populist voters are particularly reluctant to support wealthy pro-redistribution candidates. My findings help explain why widespread public support for greater redistribution need not translate into election victories for left parties.	NA
2023	223	BO34	Priming Voters’ Moral and Partisan Identities in the Face of Politicians’ Moral Transgressions	Moral identity, i.e. self-schema organized around a set of specific moral traits (Aquino & Reed II, 2002), plays an important role in people's interpretation of and decision-making in moral situations, including their reactions to others. Remarkably, moral identity has not received much attention in the study of voters' heterogeneous responses to politicians' immoral behavior. The cognitive accessibility of moral identity differs across voters. First of all, moral identity is more accessible to voters’ whose moral identity is more central to their self-definition. Second, situations can make voters’ moral identity more accessible. We conducted a set of survey embedded experiments to better understand the causal link between voters' moral identity and voters’ emotional and attitudinal response to politicians' immoral behavior. In these experiments we primed the cognitive accessibility of voter’s moral identity (and competing partisan identity) before exposure to information about politicians’ immoral behavior. Respondents whose moral self-schema were primed experienced more condemning moral emotions, evaluated the transgressor and the moral violation more negatively and showed less ingroup favoritism than respondents who were part of the control group.

2023	228	BO34	Are Moral Values Uniquely Divisive?	Political scientists have long viewed values as a source of structure and constraint in political belief systems and, more recently, as a potential contributor to affective polarization. Some scholars have argued that moral values, in particular, have contributed to disagreement and hostility between partisan groups. Yet, there is little direct and systematic evidence as to which values are moralized. Using convenience samples of US-based respondents as well as a representative, probability-based sample of respondents from the AmeriSpeak panel at NORC, we examine the moralization levels of 21 values from three different value systems (moral foundations, Schwartz values, and political values). We show that there is meaningful overlap in value moralization between value systems and considerable variation in value moralization within value systems. Using conjoint experiments, we also show that these differences in value moralization matter, with more moralized values driving stronger social polarization. Our paper contributes to the literatures on values, morality, and polarization by comprehensively examining the relationship between values and morality and how they jointly shape polarization.	NA
2023	471	BO34	What Explains Country-Level Differences in Political Belief System Coherence?	Scholars have long tried to identify the factors leading citizens to form coherent political belief systems. While extensive research explores how distinct social groups differ in degree of attitude organization, relatively little attention has been given to the possibility that particularities of political systems may affect belief system coherence. Using network analysis to model political beliefs systems based on large, representative surveys conducted across 39 European countries (the European Social Surveys), I show that belief system coherence exhibits both substantial and systematic cross-national diversity. My second contribution stems from investigating why differences in belief system organization emerge at the country level in the first place. In particular, I examine hypotheses related to elite incentives to transmit ideologically coherent information and conditions that enhance citizen demand for such information. I find belief systems to be more coherent in countries with greater party-system institutionalization, stronger programmatic citizen-party linkages, and deeper party ideological polarization.	NA
2023	1264	BO35	What causes political trust? A theory and experimental evidence from five countries	What causes political trust? This question has been a staple of political science research, but an answer has alluded consensus. In this paper, we advance a theory of trust that separates trust judgements into two causal components: the propensity to trust (a feature of the individual) and government trustworthiness (a feature of the institution). Focusing on the latter, we argue that trustworthiness is determined largely by competence, benevolence and integrity - what we call the CBI model. We aim to address which of these has the largest effect on trust judgements. We do so through conjoint experiments in five countries, which indicates broad agreement that benevolence, followed equally by integrity and competence, are the primary determinants of trust judgements. In other words, trust in government is undermined to a greater extent by the belief that the government is not looking after citizen interests than it is that the government is incompetent or lacking integrity. We link these to determinants in existing literature and suggest mechanisms to (re)build trust given these findings.	NA
2023	1580	BO35	The polarizing effect of deindustrialization on trust in democratic institutions: evidence from 171 OECD countries and rounds	This paper investigates the impact of deindustrialization on European citizens' trust in their democratic institutions. The paper utilises utility theory to explain how deindustrialization affects the public's trust in democratic institutions. According to Utility Theory, those with lower incomes and education levels will not profit from deindustrialization, whereas those with higher incomes and education levels will. Using data from the European Value Studies and the World Value Studies, a Bayesian Multilevel Analysis is performed to determine the impact of deindustrialization on trust in democratic institutions among various income and educational groups. According to the findings, deindustrialization is associated with an increase in the polarisation of public trust in democratic institutions between higher- and lower-income groups. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect, case studies are proposed to establish different pathways through which deindustrialization can lead to an increase in political mistrust.

2023	1914	BO35	How do different national class identities effect political trust?	The great majority of recent studies on political inequality identify the ‘working class’ as the social group that governments are least responsive to and is lacking descriptive representation. These studies treat the ‘working class’ as one homogeneous group, although empirically it shows that this group became more heterogeneous over time (increasing shares of pink-collar workers and immigrants). When looking at the political attitudes and electoral behaviour of this group, empirical findings are contradicting. To shed light on this, Evans et al. (2022) look at Denmark and the United Kingdom to show that the empirical contradictions can be explained by national differences in class identity. This is reflected in distinct political attitudes on redistributive and immigration policies. Thus, one might wonder whether these differences may also be observed in political trust? To analyse this question, I draw on ISSP data comparing attitudes of British and Scandinavian respondents. I expect workers drawing on their current class positions to be more trusting in core political institutions than workers referring to their class origin.	NA
2023	491	BO35	Mobility, Reference Group Change, and the Spread of Political Norms: Summer Holidays and the Radical Right in Spain	The interconnectedness of contemporary societies has led to an unprecedented spread of individuals, goods, and ideas. How does it affect perceptions of what is acceptable in the political realm? We argue that spatial connectivity can change political norms by exposing individuals to reference groups that are different from those in the area of their primary residence. These new reference groups may have different views as to what is acceptable in politics, thus leading to the spread of different political norms. To test this hypothesis, we leverage data on mobility across Spanish regions. We focus on norms against public support for the radical right, one of the most well-established norms in the political realm. Taking advantage of two close elections (April and November 2019), we will test whether mobility in the summer between those elections led to more similar perceptions of the how appropriate it is to express support for the radical right. Our results will highlight how short-term mobility can lead to the spread of ideas in politics and significantly affect norms that regulate the political realm.	NA
2023	892	BO35	The Effects of Territorial Reforms on Political Disaffection	Public opinion scholars have recently shown a renewed interest in the effects of (changes in) local context on citizens' political attitudes and behavior. In this paper, we contribute to this literature and assess how local boundary reforms affect citizens' attitudes. We combine data on Swiss municipal mergers with individual-level panel data from the Swiss Household Panel to study how jurisdictional reforms impact citizens' political trust, satisfaction with democracy, political interest, and perceptions of political influence. This data allows to compare individuals living in merged municipalities with individuals living in non-merged municipalities and to assess the effects of local boundary reforms over a long time-period (1999-2019). While we find no effect of municipal mergers on citizens' political trust, satisfaction with democracy, and political interest, using a difference-in-differences design, we uncover a positive effect on individuals' perceptions of political influence -- a finding that goes decidedly against the established literature. We argue that this positive effect has to do with the specific participatory nature of municipal mergers in Switzerland.	NA
2023	1018	BO36	Citizens' Perceptions of Online Abuse of Politicians	Online abuse of politicians can have serious detrimental democratic consequences. While recent research has provided insights into how politicians react to and perceive online abuse, we know much less about citizens’ perceptions of negative and potentially abusive messages directed at politicians. This lack of knowledge is unfortunate for two reasons. First, citizens and politicians may disagree about what exactly constitute online abuse with some politicians labelling harsh criticism as abusive. Exclusively following the perspective of politicians could potentially exclude certain groups from the political discourse. Second, we need knowledge about what citizens consider as online abuse to design countermeasures. In this study, we therefore investigate how citizens perceive criticism, insults, threats and sexist remarks directed at politicians on social media. Based on a survey experiment with 2,000 Danish citizens, we show that citizens’ assessments of the abusiveness of such remarks are not only affected by the content of the messages, but also by partisanship, political ideology and gender. Our study thereby provides novel insights into what exactly citizens consider to be abusive behavior on social media.	NA
2023	1523	BO36	Does Political Polarization Harm Subjective Freedom of Speech?	Does political polarization harm citizens' subjective sense of free speech? Seminal accounts in political science such as the ‘spiral of silence’, conformity pressures in social networks, or online echo-chambers point to social in-group mechanisms that can restrict citizens' free expression. We offer a novel alternative argument that focuses on a different aspect of political polarization. We decompose polarization into two parts: in-group attachment and out-group aversion. Specifically, we argue that out-group aversion reduces normative constraints on citizens' expression and therefore has a liberating effect on subjective free speech. We test our argument using data from two original surveys fielded in Germany and including a new measure of out-group aversion. The results broadly support our argument and suggest that out-group aversion not only significantly increases subjective freedom of speech, but is of far greater relevance than contrasting in-group mechanisms. This finding has important implications for our understanding of political polarization, public opinion and democratic culture.	NA
2023	493	BO36	Exposure to Polarised Political Discussions Online and Generalised Trust	Social media has become an important site of political discourse where people are exposed to the political views of far more other ordinary people – non-elites – than ever before. However, political discussions online are polarised, plagued by hostility, ‘fake news’, trolls, and more. While much work has been done to understand the political consequences of this, the secondary social effects of having such a climate around online political discussions remain understudied. In this study, I address this by examining the link between exposure to polarised political discourse and generalised trust. I use a vignette survey experiment where I show respondents a series of tweets - the overall distribution of which varies in the degree of polarisation between treatment groups - in a 2x2 factorial design: non-polarised/neutral, pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal, and polarised (a mix of pro- and counter-attitudinal tweets). This is designed to manipulate respondents' levels of perceived polarisation through exposure to polarised discussions on social media. I then measure respondents' levels of generalised trust using survey-based measures, asking respondents directly about their attitudes, as well as using behavioural measures.	NA

How must our political communications be structured in order to stimulate opinion transformation? This crucial and perennial question has gained increasing prominence in recent times. In two preregistered population-based survey experiments on prioritizing health or civil liberties during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany (March 2021) and on vaccination duty in Austria (November 2021), we examined the influence of communication formats in connection with the degree of societal polarization on opinion formation (polarization and depolarization). Regarding communication formats, we focus on the effects of a 'contestatory', 'collaborative' and 'open' format. Our results display a high degree of contingency: we find that in the context of lower societal polarization, engaging with counterarguments in the contestatory or collaborative format can depolarize opinions, while the open discussion format fosters polarization. By contrast, under the context of high societal polarization, it is the contestatory or collaborative format which fosters polarization. Here, only the 'open' format helps to depolarize opinions.	NA
2023	1300	BO37	Sticking to the status quo: Explaining the lack of realignment among right-libertarian voters	Scholars of electoral politics in Western Europe have highlighted the development of a two-dimensional voter preference space in place of a left-right ideological super-dimension. While there is thus strong evidence of growing numbers of economically-right, culturally-libertarian (‘right-libertarian’) voters, I show that these voters do not support liberal parties that best share their positioning, instead favouring more distant alternatives. Using cross-national data supplemented with an analysis of the 2017 German federal election, I test the theory that right-libertarians’ stable socioeconomic circumstances lead to greater political satisfaction, disincentivizing them from ‘rocking the boat’ by switching parties. In line with theoretical expectations, regression analyses from the cross-national level find right-libertarians to display consistently high levels of political satisfaction. At the German level, right-libertarians were also least likely to switch parties between 2013 and 2017, causing the liberal FDP to miss out on large numbers of like-minded voters. These findings suggest that satisfaction can act as a check on the behaviour of voters who may otherwise be expected to follow a logic of proximity voting in switching parties as the two-dimensional space has developed.

2023	290	BO37	Overlooked Realignment?' Cohort differences in Consideration Set Models	This paper studies an 'overlooked stage' of electoral realignment with a generational perspective: the consideration stage of voting. Related to this, it focuses both on the size of different cohorts’ consideration sets as well as their composition over time. I expect more recent cohorts, socialized in a fragmented party space and less bound to structural determinants of voting, to be more likely to include more parties in their consideration set than less recent cohorts.Furthermore, they have different reasoning for which parties to include in their consideration set: Parties’ positions on the socioeconomic dimension matter less than spatial closeness on the sociocultural dimension. Thus, increasing volatility among more recent cohorts might be an effect of those cohorts’ increased consideration set size when compared with older voters, while electoral shifts might be a result of divergent preferences on which parties land up in a consideration set. I test these assumptions using cross-sectional longitudinal election data from the EES (1999-2019) covering eight Western European countries. I apply APC models (including Age, Period, and Cohort) to disentangle different dimensions of age.	NA
2023	679	BO68	Where Do the Social Conservative Immigrant-origin Voters Go?	Immigrant-origin voters have come into the focus of electoral research, as their numbers among the electorates in Western democracies increase steadily. However, due to the few available data sets, the current state of research is not as detailed as needed. Simplified explanations such as immigrants vote primarily for the left/social democratic parties prevail. In fact, recent survey data sets show that conservative parties in Germany are now a force among Turkish immigrants that was able to gather a significant vote share of about 20% in 2017. This paper addresses the patterns of economic and socio-cultural preferences among immigrant-origin voters and analyses how they relate to turnout and political behaviour. We combine data from the IMGES I survey and the GLES post-election survey 2017 and are thus able to compare natives and immigrant-origin voters. Preliminary evidence shows that immigrant-origin citizens are indeed more conservative than natives when it comes to value orientations towards tradition and a preference for the traditional family but not with regard to immigration, which affects voting possibilities as no party caters to this preference combination.

2023	835	BO37	Candidate-voter demographic alignment and electoral success	An important part of the literature suggests that descriptive representation, i.e., voters represented in parliaments by MPs with similar demographic characteristics to them, increases participation as it increases satisfaction with democratic politics and trust in political institutions. This paper goes a step back and examines whether the greater the congruence of demographic and other characteristics of parliamentary candidates with the average party voter leads to a greater possibility for electoral success compared to other candidates. Combining candidates and voter surveys from 49 elections, we estimate candidate-voters congruence based on demographic (gender, race, age, etc.) and political characteristics (partisanship, political participation, etc.). We expect that candidates with a demographic profile closer to that of the average party voter can appeal to party voters much easier and therefore have an advantage in electoral competition. However, we do not expect this to apply to the entire electorate. More specifically, we argue that the effect of candidate-voter demographic congruence is most prominent in parties located at the poles of the ideological axis.	NA
2023	1504	BO38	Never on Saturday! The impact of public holiday legislation on ethnoreligious minorities' survival strategies.	How do minorities react to exclusionary nation-building policies? While some scholars see minorities' oppression as a necessary part of national homogenization, others emphasize their negative consequences. The paper contributes to this debate by focusing on the enaction of a state policy aimed at a specific ethnoreligious community, the Sephardi Jews of Salonica (Greece). Most importantly, it does so by studying the targeted group in conjunction with the choices made by members of the majority society. The paper provides causal evidence on the effect of institutional discrimination on minorities' economic status, using the 1924 Sunday closing law as a treatment. The 1924 law changed the holiday from Saturday to Sunday to signal that Christianity is the state's official religion. This effectively made opening Jewish businesses on Sundays impossible. Given that Saturday was a day of rest for Jews, Jewish store owners were forced to close their stores for two days during the week. To investigate the impact of this policy, I use a single measure: business records, implementing a business survival analysis.	NA
2023	2035	BO38	Socio-economic status, perceived discrimination, and Muslim religious identification in the West	The integration of Muslim-origin immigrants in Western Europe is a pervasive topic in public discourse and academic research. A significant puzzle remains the persistent religious identity of this immigrant group, which appears to defy insights from integration theory, which posit a progressive assimilation and secularization of immigrant generations. The dominant explanation of this puzzle points to the pervasive discrimination and exclusion Muslims face in Western Europe. However, this explanation ignores that, today, many Muslim-origin immigrants living in Western Europe have experienced strong upward social mobility and hold very diverse positions in politics, economy, and society. How does socio-economic status (SES) condition the effect of perceived discrimination (PD) on religious identification? Despite the extensive research on the Muslims’ strong preservation of religious traditions, this question is neglected in the literature. The paper builds on social identity theory to argue that the effect of PD on identification as Muslim weakens with increasing SES due to their different coping strategies against discrimination. We test our argument using Immigrant German Election Study (IMGES) data focusing exclusively on persons with Turkish migration backgrounds.	NA
2023	607	BO38	Minorities’ Views on Freedom of Expression: Unrestricted or Protective?	Normative democratic theory does not provide a univocal answer about the limits of free speech. While some argue for few or no limits to freedom of speech, others defend the introduction of clear bounds to protect vulnerable groups. It is not clear what makes individuals embrace these unrestricted (liberal) or restrained (protective) models of freedom of expression. Moreover, existing research focuses on the views of the general public, but not minorities, who are often the target of derogatory speech. In this study, we investigate the impact of hate speech on European Muslims' attitudes towards freedom of expression. For this purpose, we exploit an unexpected event occurred during the fieldwork of the European Social Survey: the release of the “Innocence of Muslims”, a short film that denigrates Islamic prophet Muhammad. The findings indicate that Muslims who were exposed to hate speech adopted a more protective stance towards freedom of expression. These findings have relevant implications for current debates on the limits of free speech and for understanding minorities' views about democracy.	NA
2023	930	BO38	Perceived Discrimination among Muslim Immigrants in the Aftermath of Terror Attacks	Violent events such as terror attacks often lead to changes in public opinion. For example, some studies have established a link between terror attacks and exclusionary attitudes towards minority groups. However, it is unclear if terror events increase perceived discrimination among members of the minority groups who are the targets of such discrimination. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which includes immigrant booster samples to investigate the effects of Jihadist terror attacks that took place in Europe during the fielding of the surveys (between 2015 – 2017) on perceived discrimination of Muslims. Our findings indicate that attitudes towards immigrants among the majority groups become more negative in the aftermath of these attacks, but there is no evidence that terror attacks increased perceived discrimination among the Muslim respondents. We also investigate the effects of Jihadist terror attacks on other attitudinal and behavioural outcomes among Muslims, such as well-being, confidence in institutions, and interest in politics.	NA
2023	460	BO39	Subjective economic inequality and political trust: evidence from a British panel study	In the post-2008 era, a host of previously stable democracies have seen a rise in political disillusionment. A diverse range of radical parties and candidates have successfully mobilised public disillusionment with politicians’ alleged responsibility for economic inequality and decline. While much of the academic literature around this topic focuses on the predictive power of macro-level economic trends on radical vote choice, much less research centres individuals' attitudes towards economic inequality itself. Addressing this gap, this paper applies the novel framework of 'subjective economic inequality' to centre individual beliefs, perceptions and fairness judgements. This paper presents evidence of how subjective economic inequality can explain between-unit and within-unit differences for an established indicator of disillusionment: political trust. Using cross-sectional and panel data from multiple waves of the British Election Study Internet Panel, this study contributes to the ongoing debate around economic inequality and its consequence for political opinion and behaviour.

2023	563	BO39	Explaining Perceptions of Income Inequality in the United States and the United Kingdom	In 2015, the British Election Study internet panel replicated questions from the American National Election Study about citizens’ perceptions of national-level income inequality. Both surveys also elicit detailed information on party choices and both content and media use. Using this unique comparative data opportunity, we estimate a comprehensive model of inequality perceptions controlling, for the first time, for all theorized determinants as well as parties and media. In addition to finding support for the ideological polarization of political sophistication identified in the previous literature, we uncover three key findings. Perceptions of inequality are primarily driven by negative normative orientations toward inequality, conservative parties - particularly in the UK - provide cross-nationally consistent downward bias to inequality perceptions, and media outlets associated with liberal/conservative audiences are correlated with perceptions of rising income inequality/decreasing income inequality.

2023	925	BO39	What is Unfair about Inequalities? Dimensions of Economic Inequalities and Fairness Perceptions in the US	Previous research has reached conflicting conclusions on how individuals evaluate information on inequalities, and how that affects their fairness perception and the need for redistribution. Empirical evidence suggests that attitudes towards inequalities and policy preferences are influenced by inequalities only when they are perceived as unfair. In this paper, I put this argument to the test, measuring how different types of information on economic inequalities influence fairness perceptions. While previous literature has conceptualized economic inequalities as a unidimensional phenomenon, I suggest that inequalities are a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Building on existing measures of inequalities, I test whether information regarding the different dimensions of inequalities influences fairness perceptions, and how each of these dimensions contributes to the overall perceived unfairness of existing inequalities. I identify the main dimensions explored in previous research—replicating some of the information treatment and adding new ones—and field a well-powered, and pre-registered conjoint experiment. The set of information provided is based on real-life distributions of different dimensions of inequalities across US states, to provide realistic inequalities profiles.	NA
2023	992	BO39	When need becomes visible: support for redistribution after exposure to inequality	A well-known problem in political economy is the question of why as inequality increases, we do not see a corresponding increase in redistributive preferences. A promising avenue of research has been to test whether the visibility of inequality matters in shifting perceptions (Sands 2017; 2020). Employing panel data from the UK related to redistributive preferences and proximity to deprivation, we find a significant and positive effect: openings of new food banks in an area are significantly linked to an increase in redistributive preferences. We argue that the impact of food banks derives from the visibility of the primary need they serve, acting as a reminder people go hungry in this economic system and countering negative stereotypes people may receive about welfare claimants. To test the mechanism, we employ a novel dataset of Twitter panel data. To explore whether the effect works through a mechanism of updated information on welfare claimants (reducing stereotypes) or rather by enhanced pro-sociality in the community, we analyse Tweets related to redistribution connected to the local authority level via pre-trained machine learning algorithms and topic modelling.

2023	1161	BO20	Representative Bureaucracy and the Big Lie: Change in How United States Local Election Officials and the Mass Public View Electoral Legitimacy, 2020-2022	The impact of the 'big lie' on mass public views of electoral practices and electoral legitimacy in the United States is well documented. In particular, after November 2020, the American public showed substantial increases in partisan polarization over beliefs in the integrity and trustworthiness of the election outcomes. What is less well understood is how these same partisan patterns were evident among a group of governmental actors who presumably should be better informed about election practices and more resistant to mis- and disinformation about the 2020 election: local election administrators. In this research, we explore gaps in views of election integrity between local election administrators and the mass public. We compare these viewpoints at two time periods: the summer before the 2020 presidential election (before the emergence of the 'big lie' and the summer before the 2022 midterm election (after eighteen months of the 'big lie'). This research has important implications for our understanding of representative democracy, election management, and how elites can be prone to some of the same conspiracy thinking that impacts the mass public.

2023	1746	BO20	Limited Effect of Elite Ideological Polarization on Mass Ideological Polarization	Elite polarization is on the rise in Western democracies. Does this elite polarization cause mass ideological polarization? I argue that when a political party takes a more extreme position, masses polarize through two mechanisms. In-partisans should follow the party and adopt a more extreme ideological stance while out-partisans should backlash and move in the opposite direction. Furthermore, I argue that whether in-partisans become polarized depends on their spatial location on the ideological scale. If a party moves to left, only those who are to the right of the party should adopt more left-wing stance. To test these expectations, I exploit a real-world sudden party polarization when the Labour Party shifted to the left. Using British Election Study Internet Panel data, I find limited evidence that elite polarization leads to mass polarization: Overall, neither in-partisans nor out-partisans became more polarized. Only Labour partisans that were located to the right of the party became more left-wing. These findings provide insight into how masses react to increasing elite polarization, alleviating pundits' concern that masses are deemed to polarize if political parties polarize.	NA
2023	1774	BO20	Mapping the Boundaries of Elite Cues Over Time: Evidence from Repeated Experiments on Support for Ukraine	The paper extends our prior work on when and how informational or partisan components of elite cues shape mass attitudes about international politics. Previously we examined multiple international issues at one moment in time; here we study two related issues—military and economic support for Ukraine, and support for expanding NATO—at multiple points in time. In the US context, we expect treatment effects to change as elite discourse on the issue polarizes, especially following the 2022 midterm elections. We report findings from a repeated survey experiment with two questions, one about support for Ukraine and the other about expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden, repeated at several points in 2022 and 2023. We also track elite polarization through news coverage. When elite opinion is less polarized, baseline public opinion should also be less polarized, and we expect any cue (generic or partisan) to shift public attitudes. As elite opinion and thus public opinion becomes more polarized, only cues from the elites that share the respondent’s party will move attitudes in the direction of the cue.	NA
2023	612	BO20	Strategic Transnational Branding: How Voters Respond to Transnational Party Linkages	When parties associate themselves with ideologically similar parties abroad, what are the consequences for how voters evaluate the party’s brand? In this paper, I implement a novel survey experiment in Sweden and Norway which exposes voters to a campaign ad that links Swedish and Norwegian political parties to their electorally successful and governing counterparts in Germany. By manipulating the content of this ad to invoke the name of the sister party abroad or the broader ideology of the shared transnational party family, I gain useful empirical leverage to isolate the effect of transnational allegiances on a party’s brand. I argue that a party connecting itself to an electorally successful party abroad should have positive consequences for its perceived viability, credibility, and competency in the eyes of voters. These effects should be especially pronounced for small parties at the party level and for partisans at the voter level. This experiment has important implications for our understandings of transnational party politics and the transnational linkages between voters and parties.	NA
2023	1431	BO041	Ideological and Affective Polarization in a Multidimensional European Space	Affective polarization—or citizens’ feelings of sympathy and hostility for in-group and out-group partisans, respectively—is of great concern to political observers. While much of the existing research has focused on the US context, there is growing evidence that affective polarization is widespread among European democracies as well. We contribute to this literature by exploring the relationship between ideological and affective polarization in multiparty and, crucially, multidimensional systems. In particular, although it is understood that elite ideological disagreement can precede feelings of partisan hostility, much of the literature relies on a simple left-right divide to capture said positional differences. Combining party and voter data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey and the Comparative Study of Electoral systems, we analyze whether affective polarization is assuaged when the salient ideological divisions in society cross-cut, rather than reinforce, each other. This study has important implications for our understanding of party-voter relations and democratic stability in a fragmented political landscape.	NA
2023	1615	BO041	Mainstream parties desertion and stable polarization in a multiparty context: the German paradox through individual, parties and mass polarization approaches.	This article aims to test several polarization approaches to explain the German paradox, a multiparty country where polarization is historically considered low but where the two mainstream parties CDU and SPD have seen their score shrinking dramatically in the two last decades. While in the meantime more radical parties like the Greens or the AFD have recorded increasing support. Using CHES and ESS data and considering 2006-2020 period, polarization is first measured through an index taking in account both parties’ position on issues and their respective electoral weight. Mass polarization is studied through population’s positions on issues. Finally, models establish the impact of social and positional characteristics on the individual probability to vote for a party over time. The results indicate that population hasn't been polarizing over time, but the polarization of parties has been increasing since 2014 and AFD appearance. Variables traditionally associated with voting for the mainstreams have been fading over time, and their interaction with ESS waves since 2014 supports the hypothesis of a running voter sorting undermining mainstream parties’ successes without polarizing the whole electorate.

2023	1643	BO041	Voter Reactions to Uncertainty. Evidence from German Elections	Empirical research on the electoral fallout of party ambiguity and voter uncertainty has often been ambiguous and uncertain itself. The focuses on an German election survey that does not only inquire voters about party locations but also about the uncertainty associated with these placements. Our contribution proceeds in two consecutive steps: (1) We show that, within the expected utility framework, voter reactions to ambiguity and uncertainty are moderated by attitudes towards risk. We demonstrate that large parts of modern electorates are rather risk-neutral than risk-averse so that the usual assumption of strictly concave utility profiles cannot be sustained. (2) Building upon these findings, we hypothesize that the political consequences of party ambiguity and voter uncertainty are dependent on voter attitudes towards risk: (2a) We demonstrate that party ambiguity and voter uncertainty are likely to reduce the electoral fortunes of political parties. (2b) Relatedly, we show that voter uncertainty tends to reduce the salience of spatial vis-à-vis non-spatial components of voter utility. (2c) These effects provide party strategists with additional strategic options by laying out blurred campaign messages and/ or platforms.	NA
2023	1948	BO041	Do they really know? How voters trace the coalition program to parties	Previous research on party promises has focused on understanding the making and fulfilment of political promises and the translation of electoral promises into coalition promises. It has also started to analyse whether and under which conditions voters accurately perceive pledge fulfilment. However, we still lack knowledge as to whether citizens are able to assign pledges to parties, more specifically whether they accurately trace coalition programs to electoral programs. Based on data from a representative face-to-face survey conducted in Germany in 2019 (N = 1.200), this paper examines whether citizens are able to identify which party a coalition promise comes from (based on a sample of 17 coalition pledges). It tests how different factors, such as party ID and pledge saliency, affects citizens’ (in)accurate perceptions. The findings of this paper have implications on accountability and political representation in multi-party systems.	NA
2023	375	BO041	How polarized is Europe? Public opinion disagreement, issue alignment, and sorting across European countries	Whereas attitudinal polarization has become a hot topic for academic debates in the USA over recent decades, the question of whether, and over which issues, European countries are polarized has so far received limited scholarly attention. Existing studies focus on single countries and different types of attitudinal polarization, not allowing for cross-national comparisons. This article provides such a comparison of the state of attitudinal polarization across 21 EU member states. Using the EVS-2017 data, we study three types of attitudinal polarization (disagreement, issue alignment, and sorting) over five key attitudinal dimensions: social inequality, immigration, EU-integration, gender, and environment. We demonstrate that different types of attitudinal polarization do not coincide with each other on a country level but do produce geographical clusters. Polarization as disagreement is higher in the East and South of Europe, while issue alignment and sorting are higher in the North and West. Looking at the three types of polarization together, immigration is the most polarizing dimension across Europe, though polarization as disagreement and sorting is also still substantial with respect to social inequality.

2023	1378	BO044	Globalization, meanings of voting and turnout: experimental evidence from the US	A burgeoning literature indicates that globalization reduces the leeway governments have over policy, with widespread consequences for democratic politics. Within this framework, the ‘room to manoeuvre’ theory argues that greater integration eventually decreases turnout by limiting the choices available to voters, thereby weakening the stake of elections. However, this finding is still debated empirically. Indeed, Blais and Kostelka (2021), recently found that the deepening of globalization is not associated with the decrease of turnout in the long run. This discrepancy thus calls for more research. In fact, there exists almost no studies which have theorized, and tested, the causal mechanism underlying the relationship between globalization constraints and turnout at the individual level, while no study has ever tested this relationship experimentally. This study fill this gap by investigating the effects of perceived constraints on turnout and by highlighting the role individual meanings of voting play in the process. We put these propositions to the test using an original experiment fielded in the 2022 midterm elections in the US. Findings have implications for theories linking government constraints and democratic legitimacy.	NA
2023	1694	BO044	The Role of Visibility for the Social Pressure-Turnout Nexus	Randomized field experiments have shown that social pressure raises turnout in elections. It is generally assumed that a key element in this social pressure mechanism comes from the visibility of the vote, that is, whether others are aware of one's decision to vote or not. Yet, a recent study conducted in Canada finds no relationship between individuals’ beliefs about others' knowledge of their decision to vote, others' potential disapproval of the decision, and turnout. We replicate and expand on this study using data from the 2022 French Electoral Study. Preliminary analyses confirm that the impact of social pressure is not conditional on visibility. We discuss the reasons for the absence of this effect and highlight the important implications of this null finding for the study of both social pressure and voter turnout.	NA
2023	434	BO044	Mental Health and Political Participation	Mental health and political engagement are two important aspects of people’s wellbeing. Although mental disorders constitute a major part of the global disease burden, we know little about the effects of mental disorders on political participation, except for depression. We map existing socio-political surveys and present the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted on the topic. We bring new insights from six surveys from five different countries (Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States) that combine questions on mental disorders and political participation. Unlike previous research, we find very little evidence for the Resource Hypothesis that mental health problems reduce political participation. Instead, we find mixed evidence that mental disorders and their comorbidity increase political participation. Our research suggests that, at least for mental disorders that do not imply severe cognitive deterioration, mental health problems mobilize people into politics.	NA
2023	828	BO044	The Effect of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Voting Participation: Evidence from the Finnish Basic Income Experiment	In many democracies, unemployed and low-income citizens are less willing to vote. Can unconditional cash transfers weaken the link between income and turnout? We study a unique experiment in Finland, which randomly assigned a sizable group of unemployed to basic income for two years (2017-19). Leveraging individual-level registry and survey data, we show that replacing conditional unemployment benefits with unconditional basic income has large positive effects on actual voter turnout and subjective levels of political efficacy. On average, the intervention increases turnout in municipal elections by about 3 p.p., an effect that is magnified among marginal voters (+ 6-8 p.p.) and persists in national elections after the end of the experiment. Our analysis suggests that the turnout effects are driven by unconditionality increasing social capital -- rather than income itself. We discuss implications for theories of voter turnout and policy feedback, and the design of basic income policies.	NA
2023	951	BO044	Political Participant Types and Socio-Economic Stratification Across Contexts and Over Time: A Multilevel Latent Class Analysis	How do people combine increasingly common non-electoral political acts with electoral-oriented participation in their individual-level repertoires of participation? And are patterns of participatory inequality and socio-economic stratification increasing over time? Despite the methodological challenges for robustly analyzing broad repertoires of participation across multiple contexts, these questions have become increasingly urgent due to mounting concerns about inequality in political participation and representation worldwide. We answer these questions in the current study by implementing recently developed techniques for latent class analysis using cross-national data from the European Social Survey (ESS) between 2002-2018. Specifically, we implement methodological innovations for conducting latent class analysis in complex multilevel data structures with covariates and measurement equivalence testing using a stepwise approach. The findings provide a well-specified assessment of three substantive areas of interest in relation to central debates in the political participation literature: socio-economic stratification across participant types, cross-national assessment, and over-time change. At a time of increased concern for unequal representation in contemporary democracies, we conclude by discussing both the methodological and substantive implications of our findings.	NA
2023	1051	BO043	Can moving to opportunity foster political integration?	Most post-industrial democracies are characterized by high spatial inequality with an increasingly unequal distribution of economic opportunity between prosperous and lagging-behind areas. A dominant economic paradigm to reduce spatial mismatch is 'moving people to jobs'. We ask about the societal implications of this policy recommendation by examining its theoretically ambiguous effects on political integration. While the expected improvements in economic outcomes could stimulate political participation, a change in location also creates disruption that may work in the other direction. We study the case of Germany. In a first step, we descriptively map spatial inequality by combining various innovative data sources into a rich indicator of local economic opportunity at the NUTS-3 level. We then merge this opportunity map with micro-level panel data to explore individual moving patterns and the important question of selection into opportunity moves. Finally, we look at economic and political outcomes of distinct types of relocation with a particular focus on differential political participation. Our results imply that there may be no trade-off between the economic goals of “moving people to jobs” and its broader societal consequences.	NA
2023	1065	PP09	The Politics of Skill Updating in the Knowledge Economy: Skill Specificity, Skill Orientation, and Preferences for Skill Updating	This paper examines the link between skill updating – i.e., the continual improvement and development of an existing skill set – and varieties of higher education in the knowledge economy. I argue that firms that primarily rely on higher education graduates with specific skills (e.g. STEM graduates) will skill update their graduates relatively more than firms that primarily rely on graduates with general high skill sets (e.g. social science graduates). I further posit that firms with a theoretical skill orientation skill update more through formal educational institutions while firms with a practical skill orientation rely more on in-house skill updating. I test the arguments leveraging comparative employer and individual survey data covering the universe of European countries. Using firm-level and individual-level data survey data, I find empirical support for the propositions. The paper identifies a new link between the nature of skills and skill updating, shows how skill orientation is linked to the type of skill updating, and stresses the importance of continual skill improvement in the knowledge economy.

2023	303	BO043	Technological Change and Preferences for Redistribution	Existing research shows that when incomes are earned through effort rather than determined by luck, inequalities are seen as fairer and demand for redistribution is lower. The effort versus luck distinction misses something important, however, as most distributive decisions in the real-world are between incomes earned through different types of work. In this paper, we provide the first experimental test of whether fairness perceptions and preferences for redistribution differ when top earners gain their incomes through luck, routine work, or (nonroutine) complex work. This set up aims to mirror the changing nature of tasks in the US labour market in recent decades as a result of routine-biased technological change. We find that impartial spectators desired tax rate on top earners is 5.3 percentage points lower for the complex work than the routine work treatment. This difference is driven by a widely-held (and acted upon) belief that high incomes derived from complex work are fairer and more deserved than those arising from routine work. Our main results are also replicated in a follow-up vignettes study, which further supports their external validity.	NA
2023	817	BO043	The Missing Link: Automation Risk, Dual VET, and Social Policy Preferences	The transition to the knowledge economy has given rise to new social risks. In this context, a growing literature argues that automation risk should increase individual demand for generous social policy. Yet, empirical findings are mixed. In this paper, we argue that the existing literature overlooks the moderating role of skill formation systems. In particular, we posit that dual VET systems undermine the link between automation risk and social policy preferences. Because they authoritatively certify the skills acquired, dual VET systems reduce the perceived risk associated with working in a routine-intensive occupation. Additionally, by allowing individuals to command above-average salaries early in their career, and by socialising young people mostly at the workplace, they instill 'workfarist' attitudes in individuals who went through the dual system. These mechanisms combine to sever the relationship between automation risk and demand for social policy in countries with a high dual VET share. Based on data from the ESS and OECD, we find evidence for this argument. Our paper therefore contributes a missing link to the literature on technological change and social policy preferences.	NA
2023	944	BO043	Housing Insecurity, House Prices, and Political Efficacy: A Self-Reinforcing Equilibrium?	Housing policy in most developed countries strongly favours homeowners and landlords. Homeowners have higher political efficacy and turnout, which further incentivises politicians to direct policy towards them -- a self-reinforcing equilibrium. We present a novel theory of housing preferences that recognizes risk in the housing market, and could suggest a way out of this equilibrium for policymakers. We argue that individuals form housing preferences based on house price and insecurity considerations, and that experiencing housing insecurity is associated with lower political efficacy and participation. Using long-run survey data from the UK we show that insecurity affects political efficacy most for renters but it also makes insecure home owners behave similarly to renters. Using a survey experiment, we show that candidates who put forward housing policies that target both prices and insecurity successfully engage previously marginalized groups in the housing market.	NA
2023	1277	BO042	The Behavioural and Attitudinal Consequences of missed Electoral Accountability. Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design.	How does holding governments to account affect the political behaviour and attitudes of voters? Electoral accountability is a foundational element of representative democracies. Yet, recent scholarly work has questioned the relevance of electoral accountability because voters often struggle to adequately punish governments for their performance, and because political parties in government may have little control over performance metrics. These findings call the relevance of electoral accountability into question. This paper advances the contemporary debate by analyzing the behavioural and attitudinal benefits of electoral accountability, even if citizens fail to adequately punish governments. I argue that when voters hold governments to account at the ballot box this has beneficial downstream effects on voters' political behaviour and political attitudes. In order to provide a causal estimation of the effect of electoral accountability on voters' subsequent behaviour and attitudes I make use of a regression discontinuity design that leverages exogenous variation in the eligibility to vote.

2023	1607	BO042	Gender-based Violence, Blame-Shifting, and Political Accountability	Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global problem and many governments fail to act against it. Our project studies this policy failure using a multiple methods (natural and survey experiments) in Turkey, a country where GBV is rampant and the government is criticized for downplaying this issue. First, we use survey data collected around an unrelated event that increased the salience of GBV. Comparing respondents interviewed before and after the event, we find that government popularity suffers when GBV gains salience. Next, we conduct a survey experiment. We show participants a hypothetical news article about a woman murdered by her partner. We randomize the rhetorical tactics the government uses to shift the blame to other actors. As outcomes, we ask whether participants blame the government for this event or GBV more generally, whether participants express less support for the government, and whether participants are willing to take action to support anti-GBV groups in Turkey. This analysis advances our knowledge about how attributions of responsibility function for entrenched social problems, and who is more likely to hold the government responsible and why.	NA
2023	199	BO042	Assigning responsibility for the actions of non-partisan ministers: The role of partisan-motivated reasoning	Are political parties held responsible for the actions of ministers with weak to no party ties? The role of political parties in the recruitment of ministers is changing, with technocrats, outsiders and elites with little party involvement entering ministerial positions. As accountability, and thus representative democracy, functions by and through political parties, this phenomenon dissociates government performance from the options on the ballot. As a result, this may shift responsibility away from political parties, leading to an accountability deficit. This paper investigates for the first time how voters assign responsibility for the actions of ministers with stronger and weaker partisan ties. While weak partisan ties may make it more difficult to identify who is responsible for government outcomes, I also investigate whether it moderates partisan motivated reasoning when assigning responsibility. I answer these questions by conducting a single-profile conjoint experiment in Italy.	NA
2023	677	BO042	Don't look up! Selective information exposure and the electoral punishment of corruption	Citizens are expected to punish corrupt politicians at the polls. Lab and survey experiments consistently show that citizens are unlikely to vote for candidates that engage in corruption. However, observational studies and field experiments frequently conclude that corrupt politicians are only mildly punished by voters. This contradiction might be caused by some of these designs not accounting for information self-selection. To overcome this limitation this paper implements a Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) experimental design that allows us to analyze the impact of corruption on voting behavior accounting for information preferences and self-selection. The results indicate that when given the option the majority of citizens do not expose themselves to information about corruption involving their preferred party and, at the same time, electoral punishment of corruption is dependent on individuals’ information preferences. The potential effects of being exposed to this information are particularly large among individuals who prefer to avoid political information altogether and consume entertainment instead. This suggests that the exposure of inattentive citizens to information about corruption scandals would increase accountability.	NA
2023	916	BO042	Economic shocks, responsibility attribution, and political insulation	There is a debate about how much negative economic shocks affect the anti-incumbent vote and support of populist parties. Many scholars believe that economic conditions matter only marginally. They claim that cultural determinants trump economic conditions. My paper shows another reason why economic shocks do not matter as much as expected. This is because companies “absorb” the impact of these shocks and politics remains quite insulated from them. Two empirical tests support this argument. First, I examine how sociotropic economic shocks (e.g., the opening of a factory or offshoring) affect voting behavior. I employ a new dataset that matches 25,000 restructuring events with subnational election results for 27 EU countries for the past 20 years and I find that these shocks do not affect incumbent and populist support. Second, I use vignette experiments embedded in nationally representative surveys in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy, and Romania) to demonstrate that voters attribute responsibility for these events to a non-political actor (the firm), as opposed to a political entity (the national government). These results hold for both negative and positive shocks.	NA
2023	1129	BO045	Rebordering Europe: A Difference-in-difference analysis of the effect of intra-EU border closures on EU support during the COVID-19 lockdowns	A large body of research shows that Europeans who regularly interact across borders are also more supportive of European integration. Citizens cherish free movement across the EU, and cross-border interactions are also expected to increase EU support and European identity in the long term. However, extant research cannot establish whether cross-border transactions indeed lead to attitude change or simply are correlated with higher EU support. The sudden and unexpected closures of intra-EU borders in the COVID-19 lockdowns represent an unprecedented possibility to empirically test the causal effect of transnational interactions on political attitudes. We expect that the decrease in European cross-border mobility during the pandemic decreased EU support and European identity. We use difference-in-difference designs that exploits variation in the closing of Germany’s borders with neighboring countries across regions and over time to estimate the causal effect of closed borders. We rely on data on COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and border controls by the Oxford Government Response Tracker (2020) and survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to estimate the short-term and long-term effect on citizens’ EU support.

2023	1131	BO045	Public support for border security policies	In recent years, political actors across the globe have tried to mobilize citizens' anxiety in support for more fortified, more controlled borders. This paper studies what drives the public support for border security policies, and specifically whether and under what conditions anxiety plays a role in border attitude formation. This is key to understanding the incentives for leaders to engage in bordering practices at a time when fears relating to a globalized world have become a highly salient and contested issue in domestic politics. We argue that people induced to feel anxious display a higher support for closed borders, and for stricter border security measures, especially if the neighboring country is perceived to be more dissimilar from their own and the policy is justified with an external threat. We test our expectations with a survey of 4000 German citizens. Respondents receive sequentially a priming experiment that induces feeling of anxiety, and a conjoint experiment that presents them with pairs of border policy plans, which include information on the policy justification, intended policy measure, and type of neighboring country.

2023	1150	BO045	Trust, Prosociality, and Immigration Policy views: Evidence from Swedish Twin Data	Extensive literature has concentrated on understanding anti-immigration attitudes given its political salience, but little is known about the underpinnings for pro-immigration attitudes. Where do pro-immigration attitudes come from? This study focuses on the role of two fundamental interpersonal orientations - generalised social trust and prosociality, both of which are often deemed as desirable, but often have ingroup bias tendencies. Then do they have any meaningful implications on immigration attitudes? To answer these questions, the study uses a large Swedish twin sample to examine the effects of generalised social trust and multiple prosocial behaviours on immigration policy views. The use of twin-pair fixed effects models help to effectively control for confoundings shared within twin pairs. The results suggest that individuals with higher generalised trust as well as volunteers, charity donors, and registered organ donors are more likely to express approval for pro-immigration policies. However, using a subsample of identical twins, only the positive effects of trust remain robust. Generalised trust, therefore, appears to be a robust determinant for pro-immigration attitudes, which also indicates an inclusionary outlook of social trust in Sweden.	NA
2023	57	CP26	The Short-Term Effects of Visa Restrictions on Migrants’ Legal Status and Well-being: A Difference-In-Differences Approach on Venezuelan Displacement	Most countries across the globe introduce visa restrictions to regulate immigration, yet little is known about their effect on migrants' decision to migrate and their well-being. I study the mass displacement of Venezuelan nationals, and through a difference-in-differences research design, I compare the effectiveness of introducing visa restrictions in reducing overall migration flows in certain countries across South America. I use a data set of 85,000 migrants and refugees - mostly Venezuelans - surveyed by the UNHCR as part of its monitoring activity of displaced migrants in the Latin American region. Findings suggest that visa restrictions increased irregular entry and irregular visa status for migrants while also leading to changes in their priorities. Unexpectedly, I do not find evidence of increased violence suffered by migrants who switch towards irregular entry channels. This research contributes to the academic and policy debate on the effectiveness of visa restrictions on migratory flows, as well the literature on the effects of migration policies on migrants' well-being.

2023	761	BO045	The Electoral Politics of Immigration and Crime	Concern that immigration worsens crime problems is prevalent across Western publics. How does it shape vote choice? I argue that relative to cultural and economic immigration threat, differences between left-wing and right-wing voters are small on the dimension of crime. High concern about immigrant crime among left-wing voters -- even those with high educational attainment and those living in cities -- coupled with left-wing parties' lack of law-and-order positions creates a voter-party mismatch that can lead to electoral shifts benefiting right-wing parties. Using survey data from 14 Western European countries linked with data on party positions, I first empirically confirm the voter-party mismatch on the Left, especially among Green and radical-left parties. Drawing on a panel survey from Germany, I further show that concern about immigration and crime increases vote intention for the center-right among Green party voters. Exploring mechanisms, I present evidence consistent with the idea of a voter-party mismatch. I conclude that a more complete understanding of how immigration shapes electoral politics must incorporate crime as an important dimension.	NA
2023	1174	BO68	Moving political contexts: Immigrants’ political ideology and party preferences pre- and post-migration	This paper asks to what extent individuals’ political ideology and party preferences transfer from one country to another. Disagreement exists in the literature about whether political attitudes and behaviours are formed early in life and are resistant to change, or are highly adaptable in response to political experiences in a new context and as a migrant. We use data from the 2021 Canadian Election Survey with an over-representation of new Canadian residents, and which includes measures of self-assessed pre- and post-migration political ideology and party preferences. We show how new Canadian residents report a greater preference for Canadian political parties on the left of the parties they preferred pre-migration. This finding is in line with the literature on immigrants’ vote choice that shows a preference of parties on the left of the political spectrum among immigrants, but sharply contrasts with our second finding: new Canadian residents simultaneously report a shift to the ideological right post-migration. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature.	NA
2023	1242	BO046	Who speaks and who is loved matters: a visual conjoint on how policy support is conditional on social identity markers	In parallel to the advancement in policies that improve environmental protection and the lives of women and LGBTQ+ people, there is a growing concern about policies that backlash on these issues. To what extent is support for social policies conditional? Our thesis is that irrespective of the direction of the policy, support is conditional on several aspects of social identity: identity, affiliation, support of the ethnic ingroup, rejection of the ethnic outgroup, and the nativist rationale of the social policy. Using a visual conjoint experiment in the Netherlands, we confirm our expectations. Although the effects have a greater impact among nativists on all other facets of social identity, support or rejection of the ethnic ingroup can drastically alter policy support also among non-nativist citizens. These results have key implications on the variable nature of citizens' support for the backsliding of liberal democratic tenets.	NA
2023	1281	BO046	What raises concern about discrimination of immigrants among the native born? Evidence from two survey experiments in Denmark	One route for disadvantaged minorities to become successful in advancing their cause is to convince majority groups about the adversity they experience to potentially gain their political support. We know very little about what works in this regard. In this study, we add to the scant existing research by investigating the effectiveness of different arguments/forms of evidence for changing natives’ concerns about discrimination of ethnic minorities. We use two naturalistic treatments—an audit study and a newspaper article featuring a personal story of discrimination—that have been used to highlight ethnic discrimination in our study context: Denmark. In two survey experiments, we find that both types of evidence cause native Danes to become somewhat more concerned about discrimination, but the personal story is significantly more effective. The personal story also increases donations to a charity for ethnic minority members (a behavioral indicator of out-group relations), and elevate support for anti-discriminatory policies. We also find evidence that the positive effective of the personal story is driven by positive affect. Our results suggest cautious optimism for raising awareness about discrimination.	NA
2023	1244	BO048	The Effects of Shame and Pride on Affective Polarization	Many democracies increasingly suffer of affective polarization, which is fueled by dissatisfaction with politics and has profound consequences for the functioning of democratic systems. However, the emotional roots of affective polarization are not very well known beyond anger and anxiety. In this article, I study how the “self-conscious” emotions shame and pride affect affective polarization. In two survey experiments in Great Britain and the United States, I elicit shame and pride in respondents using “emotion recall” and measure the effects of these emotions on affective polarization.	NA
2023	1466	BO048	Put Them All in One Bag': Polarized Perception of Homogeneous Out-Party Camps	Polarization in multi-party systems is a complex matter. Compared to the classic but rare two party case in the US, there are more points of reference between which ideological differences and affect can occur. Recent approaches considered groups of favoured and unfavoured parties, but continue to treat all parties individually. I argue that the perception of political camps consisting of multiple ideologically close parties plays a crucial role in the judgement of politically opposite politicians and voters. Following literature from psychology on out group perception, I assume that opposing parties are perceived as ideologically more homogenous than those on one's own side of the political spectrum. Using attitudinal and ideological perception items on each party from a multiwave panel survey surrounding the German federal election 2021, I analyse the perception of homeogenous party camps depending on party affiliation and ideological self placement. I furthermore test hypotheses regarding affect. I conclude that for valid measurements of polarization in multi-party systems, one should focus on differences between party camps rather than just individual parties.	NA
2023	1955	BO048	Does Partisan Bias Spillover into Non-Political Domains? A Comparative Conjoint Analysis of Interpersonal Affective Polarization	Partisanship has been shown to affect decision making even in non-political areas, such as residential choice, spousal selection, and economic behavior. However, few studies have been able to clearly distinguish the effect of partisan 'taste-based' discrimination from the possibility that partisans engage in 'statistical' discrimination using partisan identifications. To address this gap, we test the generalizability of partisan bias spillover into non-political decisions in the European and US context. Specifically, we use a conjoint analysis to evaluate the impact of political and non-political factors on three types of social decisions: selecting a spouse, choosing a neighborhood to live in, and deciding which business to patronize. Consistent with prior findings, we expect that partisanship will strongly influence all three social decisions, even when non-political but still politically relevant information is controlled. Additionally, we assess the strength of partisan discrimination against utility-maximizing factors relevant to each social decision to define the limits of partisan bias and affective polarization in comparative perspective.

2023	208	BO048	How We Think About the Political Stances of Others: Evidence on Projection from Canada, Germany, and the UK	What leads people to assume that others are more or less similar to them ideologically? We investigate this question by examining data on respondent assumptions about the ideological proximity of hypothetical voters via an original survey experiment fielded in Canada, Germany, and the UK. In doing so, we build on the Social Categorization Model as well as recent political science research on second order political beliefs. Our study begins by laying out patterns in perceived left-right placement based on partisan affiliations, highlighting that placements are less extreme than one might expect based on broader survey evidence. The main analysis then explores the potential role of shared partisanship and overlapping demographic markers in increasing the presumed ideological (dis-)similarity of others. Results suggest that across all three of our country cases, projection plays an important role in shaping how we think about the political stances of others – but that the effects of demographic markers are only substantively significant vis-à-vis people who lack an explicit partisan affiliation.

2023	1596	BO049	Democratic acceptance of dense housing ballots in Swiss cities and towns. Evidence from a conjoint experiment.	The lack of affordable housing threatens the livelihood of ever increasing numbers of people globally. One policy solution to this housing crisis in the Global North – to substantially increase the supply of housing in sustainable manners – often leads to public opposition to the development of new, dense housing. These adverse policy feedbacks emphasize the (re-)distributive character of housing policies, often leading to a reading of policy decisions in terms of winners and losers and reducing complex decision-making into mutually exclusive alternatives. We study this decision-making in the Swiss direct-democratic setting, where voters are used to decide at the ballot what is built how and where. New experimental survey data on residents’ behavior across 162 Swiss statistical cities and towns allows us to study the structurisation of the conflict on housing. We aim to delineate an institutional misfit between those who can decide on policies and those who would benefit from redistributive policies, driving the politicization of the housing conflict and pointing to normative implications regarding public decision-making.

2023	899	BO049	Mandatory Military Service and Support for Redistribution: A Tale of Inter-Class Contact	Does contact between people from different socioeconomic classes increase support for policies aiming to reduce inequality? The scarcity of research addressing this question, as well as the shadow of self-selection looming over most of it, calls for more research on the relationship between inter-class contact and political attitudes. I contribute to this field by examining an unexplored institution in the existing literature: compulsory military service. A diff-in-diff approach, focusing on Spanish cohorts close to the removal of conscription and with females as the control group, reveals that males born in conscripted cohorts are significantly more likely to support redistribution. I present placebo tests discarding that these findings merely reflect a differing trend between genders in a broader set of political attitudes, as well as several robustness checks. Furthermore, I rule out plausible alternative explanations as well as present empirical evidence in support of conscription increasing inter-class contact.	NA
2023	928	BO049	The Role of Individual Morality in Perceptions of the Role of Government in Addressing Social Problems	Several prominent strands of recent research have aimed to locate the origins of political disagreement in variation in individual moral psychology. But it is also possible that a great deal of political disagreement arises from politics itself, as citizens observing political contestation come to believe different things about which problems are societally important and which can be addressed through government action. We report results from a novel survey experimental design that presents respondents with pairwise comparisons of the relative severity of social problems in each single instance of the problem, pairwise comparisons of the relative severity of the problem in the aggregate across society, and pairwise comparisons of the priority for government addressing these same social problems. We use responses from these data—combined with auxiliary questions about perceived prevalence of the same set of problems and perceived feasibility of government action—to locate where ideological and partisan differences arise, whether in the evaluation of the problems themselves, in perceptions of aggregate severity, or in the plausibility that government can address them.

2023	939	BO049	Redistribution Preferences in an Experimental Online Game	How do highly redistributive regimes affect redistribution preferences? Evidence from literature on political socialisation and authoritarian legacies shows that in new democracies, a bias is present against the ideological spectrum connected to the former authoritarian ideology. Experiences that can be clearly tied to a particular political ideology can, therefore, create negative associations with such. This pattern can also be observed for immigrants coming from (former) communist countries. In this experiment programmed in oTree, I take a step back to assess the effect of highly redistributive regimes on support for redistribution preferences using attitudinal and behavioural measures. Results suggest heterogeneous treatment effects for age and prior political stances. The observed effects also depend on the specific redistribution outcome examined. Unlike expected, highly redistributive systems tend to increase redistribution preferences. This effect is stronger for those actually benefitting from this system. By conducting this experimental online game, I do not only contribute to the understanding of institutions and redistribution preferences, but also propose a combined attitudinal and behavioural approach to experimentally measure preferences.

2023	1373	BO050	Violence, Social Cohesion, and the Paradoxical Role of Good Governance: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in German Cities	Good governance is often associated with positive effects on citizens' political support and social cohesion. However, our research suggests that these effects may be more complex than previously thought. We argue that citizens who live in contexts of good governance may adapt their expectations and respond with heightened discontent if these expectations are not met. To test this assertion, we conducted a study in German cities using a geo-coded survey experiment to investigate the relationship between violence and citizens' perceptions of social relations. We find that encountering violence leads to a more pessimistic view of social relations in the neighborhood and society as a whole. Importantly, we find that respondents who assessed the local government as being efficient and responsive were more likely to 'hunker down' in response to violence, suggesting that good governance can raise citizens' expectations and magnify the negative effects of deviations from these expectations. These findings challenge assumptions about the straightforward benefits of good governance and highlight the need for further research on the dynamic relationship between governance and citizens' political attitudes.

2023	1418	BO050	Christian religiosity and nativism in Europe	The rise of right-wing political parties and the reasons for it has been among the most important topics within political science debates. Yet, we still lack information on the influence of religiosity on the success of right-wing parties. This is surprising given anecdotal evidence suggests this success to be often based on the support of Christian-fundamentalist groups of citizens. To explore the effect of religiosity, I examine the impact of a multidimensional concept of religiosity – including the dimensions of belonging, beliefs, and behaviour – on nativist attitudes that have been shown to be the key predictor of right-wing voting. To do so, I use data from the ninth wave of the European Social Survey, covering 47,811 respondents in 29 European countries. Implementing multilevel analysis, I find a positive effect of belonging on nativism and a negative effect of beliefs on nativism in Europe. As I outline in more detail in the conclusion, these findings underline the relevance of a more differentiated approach towards religiosity.	NA

Building on earlier work on the impact of welfare state policies on subjective well-being, we extend this logic to a sample of high, middle, and low income countries. We examine the impact of multiple measures of welfare policy on a range of new 'quality of life' indicators now available on a global scale via new data sets. Using both cross-sectional and time-series data, we find a consistent and positive impact on a wide range of objective and subjective well-being measures from welfare policies. We discuss implications for further research on the welfare state and well-being in general.	NA
2023	1631	BO050	Anomie and its Threat to Democracy: An Analysis based on Data from ten European countries	In recent years, there has been growing concern about the stability of European democracies. The theory of anomie, developed by Émile Durkheim and Robert K. Merton, suggests that social disintegration and the loss of normative meaning can lead to declines in the social order. However, this potential factor in the destabilization of democracy has largely been studied theoretically. This study aims to investigate the relationship between anomie and democracy-endangering attitudes and behaviors empirically, using original data from ten European countries. By examining levels of satisfaction with democracy, political trust, and the willingness to use violence to express political attitudes, the study seeks to understand how perceptions of an anomic state may foster anti-democratic attitudes. The research also looks at attitudes towards major crises, such as the Covid 19 pandemic, and their potential to contribute to social polarization and perceptions of division. By using original data from multiple countries, this study offers a unique and comprehensive look at the relationship between anomie and democracy in Europe.	NA
2023	288	BO050	Beyond religiosity cleavages: Heterodox beliefs and political behaviour	Whether belief in supernatural forces still affects political participation is an established question in political behaviour research. Survey-based research has focused traditionally on one type of such belief – conventional religiosity, usually operationalised as belief in God. Comparative survey programmes, however, offer increasingly more nuanced measures of supernatural beliefs, including heterodox ones (that is, in astrology, faith healing, lucky charms and fortune telling). We argue that heterodoxy leads to patterns of political participation that distinguish it from conventional religious belief and non-belief. Using a comparative survey source, we demonstrate empirically that political science should treat heterodoxy as an important explanation of political behaviour. Applying an operationalisation that distinguishes heterodoxy from religious belief and non-belief, we find that heterodoxy is widespread in modern societies and is empirically associated with low electoral participation and extremist party choice. The role of heterodoxy in promoting these political outcomes highlights a previously overlooked cultural explanation of the current democratic malaise. The connection of heterodox beliefs with receptiveness to naïve epistemic claims defies immediate political solutions and supports ominous predictions regarding the future of good democratic governance.

2023	1001	BO051	Environmental protest, issue bricolage and public opinion	Environmental social movements in Europe have recently grown and diversified in terms of tactics and demands. Increasingly, environmental movements began to combine different issue claims, mostly mixing exclusively environmental with socio-economic and civil right demands. This strategy of issue-bricolage as well as its causes and effects remain however understudied. We hypothesize that issue-bricolage has intensified in recent years as a function of societal salience of the environmental and climate issue, thus potentially expanding the range of the movements’ supporters. First, we investigate German protest events (1950-2022) to identify how issue bricolage dynamics of the environmental movements have developed compared to other protest issues. A bidirectional model of public opinion-protest dynamics is tested. Second, we conduct a survey experiment in order to study how the combination of different sub-issues affects preferences on environmental policies. The results highlight how and when issue bricolage can become a winning strategy in public opinion. Our study contributes to a better understanding of social movement strategies and their influence on public opinion.	NA
2023	1397	BO051	Unpopular but Effective? The Use of Disruptive Protest to Change Public Discourse	Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil have made use of disruptive tactics designed to attract media attention to promote their cause. Critics accuse them of setting back the climate movement by generating negative sentiments about environmental activism. However, the activists involved in disruptive actions themselves do not see this as a problem: they acknowledge that what they are doing is unpopular, but argue that this is outweighed by the benefits of greater attention for their issue in public discourse. Can disruptive protests succeed in increasing support for their policy ideas in public discourse despite their controversial tactics? This study seeks to answer this question by measuring changes in the favourability of public discourse from protest groups’ own perspectives. I analyse news discourse about three policy areas in the UK - climate change, immigration, and austerity - and quantitatively measure its similarity to the preferred discourse of different protest groups over a 10 year period. The results should provide insight into the tactical trade-offs activists face, with implications for theorists of contentious politics as well as practical implications for activists themselves.	NA
2023	1420	BO051	Social Movements and Preferences for Redistribution: A Public Opinion Study	What is the effect of protests in shaping preferences for redistribution? While the role of ideology and political narratives in the inequality-redistribution link has been extensively investigated, there is no empirical evidence connecting political mobilization with redistributive demands. Against classic rational choice models, experimental and observational evidence shows that ideology, perceptions, or morals affect people's redistributive demands. However, we still know little about whether this experimental evidence might translate to actual political settings. The present paper argues that massive mobilizations can affect people's preferences for redistribution by affecting their moral evaluations or perceptions of inequality. To test these expectations, I rely on a most-likely case approach with an 'unexpected event during survey design' methodology, studying the effect of several protests: anti-austerity waves in 2011 in Portugal and Spain and the French Gilets jaunes in 2018 and their spillover effects in Belgium and Switzerland. The results show that these protests led to higher redistributive demands, providing new insights into inequality and mobilization research. Moreover, the findings are informative about the role of protests in inducing or catalyzing party systems' change.	NA
2023	1517	BO051	(Radical) Actions speak louder than words? How action forms can benefit social movements’ public visibility and support	Social movements may strategically choose from a broad action repertoire and this choice can be consequential for their public visibility and support. Our study analyses under which conditions the choice of radical protest pays off or has diametral effects to movements’ public visibility. We draw on a comparison between two recent movements in Germany, i.e. Fridays for Future and the anti-Covid-containment Querdenken, since they both emerged as reaction to two pressing current social challenges, i.e. climate change and the Covid-pandemic. Comparing these two cases in the early phase of their protest activity, we are able to assess whether large protests or more radical action forms are more beneficial and how they are able to shape public discourse. We use automatically collected, fine-grained protest event data in combination with media-based measures of public resonance and support, which are based on state-of-the-art text-as-data approaches. Our findings contribute to research on social movements, communication science as well as public opinion studies.	NA
2023	1881	BO047	Where is the social outburst growing and what are its consequences? longitudinal analysis of protesters in Chile.	In October 2019, Chile experienced one of the most critical protest cycles since the return to democracy; a phenomenon referred to as 'Estallido Social'. This paper aims to characterize the trajectories of participation in demonstrations and the effect of the social outburst on these trajectories. Using six waves of a longitudinal survey of Chile (N=1,513), we estimate sequence models which allow us to classify clusters of protest participation trajectories between 2016 and 2022. The results show three types of clusters: those disaffected from the protest (70%), who did not participate in any protest during the period analyzed; the mobilized (8%), who have tended to participate in protests throughout the process and particularly during 2019; and finally the recruited (22%), who although they present moderate levels of participation tend to become active, particularly in 2019, and then withdraw during the period 2021-2022. Multinomial regression analyses show that recruits tend to be people from the center with low levels of organization and low levels of education. Political and social consequences are discussed.	NA
2023	1218	BO70	Threat perceptions and the affective dimension of issues	Citizens’ relation with political issues has traditionally been analyzed considering positions along policy alternatives and/or salience. We argue that there is also an emotional component to issues to be considered. We focus on how issues are perceived as threats, understood as perceptions of future damage. In a context of growing uncertainty, expectations about the future are bound to become more central to the definition of political attitudes and behaviors. In this paper we explore a number of threats arising from different challenges (climate change, pandemics, feminism). We analyze the structure of such perceptions (distinguishing individual/collective and material/symbolic dimensions) and its relation to issue positions. We show that threat perceptions are something different than simply a manifestation of underlying positions on these issues. We also show that threat perceptions are related mostly to fear, but also occasionally to anger. Finally, we show that threats perceptions vary in their degree of political articulation.	NA
2023	1460	BO052	Migrant assimilation and the rise of the anti-migration movement: Evidence from Spain	This paper looks at how migration and assimilation impact the voting behavior of native locals and how these depend on the cultural affinities of the migrant group. Over the last decades, Spain experienced a large and diverse flux of migrants reaching over 15 percent of the population share in the early 2000s. While many migrants came from Hispanic countries, sharing the same language and cultural background, many were from less affine regions such as the African Maghreb. We first document migration and integration patterns within Spain across the last three decades by combining different administrative data sets on migrant flows as well as birth and marriage certificates. Then, we look at voting outcomes covering the last 30 years and find that vote shares of anti-immigration parties increase with the percentage of migrant residents in the municipality but decrease with measures of migrant integration. This result is driven by smaller-sized municipalities, where migration might be more salient, and by migrant groups of non-Western European or non-Hispanic origin.	NA
2023	48	BO052	Beyond anti-immigration: Understanding radical right voters' immigration, gender and sexuality grievances	Radical right voting is commonly explained by cultural grievances over immigration. Research shows that these cultural grievances also include gender and sexuality dimensions. How can we understand radical right voters’ cultural grievances in a comprehensive way, inclusive of immigration, gender and sexuality grievances? I analyse qualitative interviews with German radical right voters, asking how they perceive and argue about social group relations. I argue that interviewees disregard or justify existing discrimination structures. Further, they perceive zero-sum dynamics between advances for discriminated groups and losses for dominant groups. Together, these perceptions lead them to perceive advances for discriminated groups as unfairly harmful to dominant groups. The interviews illustrate these mechanisms for native-immigrant, men-women, and straight-LGBTQI+ group relations. However, interviewees consider group characteristics and therefore use different arguments to explain these perceptions for different groups. The study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of radical right voters’ cultural grievances, beyond immigration and inclusive of gender and sexuality dimensions.	NA

In turn, such feelings of subjective status threat predict authoritarian attitudes. This is striking, given that these groups remain objectively privileged. What explains this mismatch between objective and perceived reality? We argue that this tension results from conflicting identity needs. Optimal Distinctiveness Theory proposes that individuals’ well-being relies on an optimal balance between their needs a.) to belong to the larger group and b.) to be recognized as unique entities within that larger group. We argue that most whites and men feel firm belonging to society and even perceive themselves as prototypical members of it. However, their firm belonging to the larger society, paired with a subjectively perceived erosion of subgroup recognition, leaves their need to be recognized as whites or men unsatisfied. Online experiments show that whites and men become more supportive of affirmative action and less hostile towards outgroups when their subgroups are recognized. Hence, minority empowerment will be more sustainable if majority members’ uniqueness need is accounted for.	NA
2023	1148	BO053	Is Anybody Here an Expert? The Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Technocratic Attitudes in Spain	Support for technocracy increases in times of crisis and economic shocks. However, we do not know how durable initial changes are and whether they can be translated into already existing ideological divides. The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis offers a suitable case study to answer these questions. We present results from a panel study in Spain conducted between January 2020 to November 2022. The results show that support for technocracy increased substantially just after the onset of the pandemic crisis. Moreover, we also show that an ideological divide has emerged in Spain around technocracy, as right-wing respondents (measured by vote choice before the outbreak) have become comparatively more technocratic. We explore two mechanisms explaining the ideological polarization in technocratic attitudes: (1) anti-incumbent reaction to the left-wing coalition government; and (2) activation of latent right-wing anti-democratic attitudes. The mechanisms are explored estimating the moderating effects of approval for the prime minister and proxies for latent authoritarian preferences (Francoist street names and electoral data). Overall, the results suggest that the initial increase in technocratic preferences was absorbed by the left-right cleavage.	NA
2023	1233	BO053	The Evolving Politics of using AI-based Algorithms in Public Policy: Evidence From a Field Experiment	Government agencies are routinely using AI-based algorithmic systems to make high-stakes policy decisions (e.g., policing, welfare, education) without the knowledge or consent of the public. This is coming at a significant cost, as the deployment of AI has sparked substantial backlash in several high-profile cases where its usage came to light. How do people view the use of AI algorithms in determining important policies? We explore this question, focusing on the way views evolve in response to personal experience with AI-guided decision-making and to exposure to information about the potential implications. We do so using a field experiment conducted in a real-world online labor marketplace, combined with a three-wave panel survey. We track the preferences of over 3,500 workers hired to perform a range of tasks, where the identity of the employer who assigns them to tasks, the content and valence of the tasks they perform are randomly assigned. The results of the experiment will provide insight on the formation and likely trajectory of citizens’ attitudes on AI-usage in shaping public policies.	NA
2023	1490	BO053	Maintaining Trust in Times of Crises: Citizens Response to Changing Government Advise	Evidence across the social science suggests that trust in government authorities and public experts is a key factor during times of crisis. This paper studies how the (in)consistency of government communication influences peoples belief updating and stated trust in public institutions. Drawing on an information experiment with a representative sample of German citizens (N=10,500), we find that inconsistent advise has a negative effect on perceived credibility and competence of government institutions. In studying how to overcome the negative attitudes towards inconsistency, we use another find that informing people about the scientific process leading to changing evidence has a positive effect on perceived credibility of the sender, but does not render negative effects of inconsistent messages insignificant. We complement this analysis with an observational study and document that incumbents who can run for re-election in times of crisis change their recommendations less often when the election is closer in time. Taken together, the results suggests that governments may face a trade-off between electoral support and public welfare once new, inconsistent evidence becomes available.	NA
2023	852	BO053	Which Experts and Why? A Study of Public Health Expertise during COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, and the US	How do citizens perceive different types of public health experts and what are the implications for compliance with public health measures? I study this question using a series of survey experiments implemented in Germany, Italy, and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experiments randomized whether respondents received a public health recommendation from either a generic, World Health Organization, national, or local public health expert. The results show little difference on overall acceptance of the recommendation, but they do indicate that different types of public health experts have strengths and weaknesses when communicating with the public. International and national experts were considered to be more competent and knowledgeable, while local health experts were trusted more to understand the needs of respondents’ communities. I also find some differences based on partisan affiliation, with right-wing respondents more affected by the treatments. These results suggest that distrust of experts may have different causes based on the nature of their position, which is important to consider when conveying public health measures to the public.	NA
2023	1140	BO054	Support for policies to regulate technological change	What policies do individuals prefer in response to various forms of technological change and digitalization, broadly understood? This paper focuses on theories explaining support for “technological protectionist” policies such as regulation and taxation. We theorize that support for such policies should be broadly based on whether they are perceived to be detrimental for economic growth and/or benefit particular groups who are losing out from rapid automation and workplace technological change. We also hypothesize that a set of measures that capture different forms of “technological risk” should correlate with support for such policies. To test our hypotheses, we present new data from large, representative samples in 5 EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden). We measure support for empowering unions to influence technological adoption in the workplace, regulating and taxing firms that substitute workers with machines or algorithms, regulating the “gig” economy and workplace monitoring, and taxing Internet retailers. We provide a battery of measures of various forms of risk and present the results of embedded experiments that frame the policy as having socio-tropic benefits but distributional costs.	NA
2023	132	BO054	When Do Citizens Resist the Use of Algorithmic Decision-Making in Public Policy? Theory and Evidence	In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the use of algorithmic decision-making systems (ADSs) to assist or replace human decision-making in a wide range of policy contexts. These include decisions on issues such as policing, criminal sentencing, and social welfare assistance. How do citizens view the incorporation of this technology in making high-stakes decisions? I introduce a new theory to explain the conditions under which citizens view ADSs as legitimate, fair, and accurate and test it using two original experiments embedded in a national US survey. Using evidence on a wide range of decisions and policy domains, I show that citizens exhibit aversion to the use of ADSs in decisions that sanction rather than assist and when they are required to make inferences about individuals rather than collectives. Evidence from a second experiment suggests that the employment of ADSs in such contexts undermines the legitimacy of the policy decisions they inform. Overall, this study provides novel insights into ways that ADSs can be used in public policy and the political implications of this growing phenomenon.	NA
2023	747	BO054	Can Government Policies Moderate Political Backlash to Technological Change?	A rapidly growing literature suggests that economic uncertainty created by structural transformation and technological change contributes to political dissatisfaction and the recent surge in populist voting. We address a natural but often overlooked follow-up question: can governments moderate political backlash to economic modernization through appropriate policy interventions? While existing work suggests that spending cuts and austerity are electorally harmful to governments, we know surprisingly little about the presence of the reverse mechanism. We theorize the conditions under which expansive government policies may increase political support among those affected by technological change and empirically zoom in on a carefully chosen and significant policy intervention: the French professional security contract (CSP), introduced with the explicit aim of supporting workers hit by structural economic change. Building on fine-grained register data from the French Public Employment Service, we examine whether the number of local CSP recipients mediates the relationship between structural economic change and municipal-level turnout and election outcomes. We complement the analysis with original surveys to study underlying mechanisms and test potential explanations of why a sizeable intervention does (not) moderate political responses.	NA
2023	804	BO054	Labour conflict and the diffusion of telecommunications	In the 19th century, two phenomena happened at the same time. On the one hand, the arrival of telecommunications, with the telegraph as a vanguard. On the other, Sweden and other countries witnessed the arrival of the labour movement. In this paper I investigate if places with greatest conflict, those municipalities with more strikes and work stoppages, had a greater adoption of technology. Autocratic or semi-democratic regimes typical of the 19th century could use newly arrived telecommunications to repress the labour movement, as the telegraph facilitated repression. Alternatively, monarchs and autocrats could invest less in disputed spots, and use new (and popular) technology to reward loyal areas. Using newly digitized panel data, I test which of the two hypotheses has greater empirical support.	NA
2023	1272	BO056	Spillover effects in mixed-member systems	We study voting behavior in mixed-member electoral systems where voters cast votes for both parties and candidates. A broad empirical literature based on aggregate data provides evidence for spillover or contamination effects between first and second tier votes. The mechanism of this link at the individual level, however, is not well understood. We argue that at the ballot, voters face what is actually a simultaneous choice problem. Contamination is then better understood as a consequences of a two-commodity choice problem where individuals have non-separable preferences and trade off gains from (strategic or sincere) voting in any single tier with losses from discordant behavior across tiers. Results from a mixed logit specification of the theoretical model suggest that such spillover effects are important.	NA
2023	1314	BO11	Social norms, local opinion leaders, and support for policy proposals	By involving ordinary citizens in decision-making, citizens' assemblies can help to strengthen legitimacy and trust in democratic institutions. While previous literature has focused primarily on the effects on citizens' trust in democratic decision-making processes, we have little insight into the potential effects they have in influencing public opinion on salient policy issues. As the recommendations or decisions made by the participants can be widely publicized, the positions advanced by ordinary citizens can provide the public with relevant cues on social norms around a given issue. This may have significant implications for voters' opinion formation, particularly if they share a social identity with the citizen representative. To test this argument, we present a visual conjoint experiment designed to closely mirror the actual online participation forum of the Conference for the Future of Europe, one of the largest citizens’ assemblies ever undertaken. By virtue of the conjoint, we experimentally manipulate the policy position, the extent to which the sender is conceived as an opinion leader, the polarization associated with the policy position put forward, and the sender’s shared local social identity.

2023	702	BO056	Vital Victories and Disastrous Defeats: Affective Polarization, Meanings of Voting and Acceptance of Election Results	Affective polarization – namely hostility towards out-party members – appears to be on the rise in many countries. This phenomenon has attracted increasing scholarly attention. The focus of existing studies is mainly on whether and how affective polarization in the electorate reflects policy or ideological differences between party supporters. This study looks at a different manifestation of affective polarization, namely how partisans see the meanings of voting of the outgroup party supporters. The focus is on how “dangerous” the ingroup would find the out-party winning the election to be. This is important because it might have consequences on how much sore a loser one will end up to be after the election. We study: a. How does affective polarization relate to perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting? b. Is there a link between perceptions of outgroup meanings of voting and satisfaction with/acceptance of the election results? We test our preregistered hypotheses using original survey data from USA, Brazil and Italy. The results inform scholars about the extent to which affective polarization is connected to citizens’ views on the electoral process.	NA
2023	772	BO056	The good and the bad: The negatively curvilinear relationship between affective polarization and democratic support	In recent years, affective polarization (AP) has become an increasingly “hot topic” in public and academic debate, spurring widespread worries about its alleged detrimental impact on citizens’ democratic attitudes. Yet, prior studies on the relationship between AP and democratic support show mixed results: Some scholars document negative correlations (Armaly & Enders 2022; Wagner 2021), whereas others show the opposite (Guedes-Neto 2022). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that a certain degree of AP could be beneficial for democratic support by increasing the stakes of politics and stimulating a feeling of involvement with the democratic system (Mason 2018). In contrast, extreme levels of AP may erode support by driving a negative view of politics as an intense strife over power and a potential threat to the status of one’s preferred party (Armaly & Enders 2022). As such, we propose that the relation between affective polarization and democratic support may not be strictly linear, but instead negatively curvilinear. We employ Generalized Additive Modelling on data from the Comparative National Elections Project to test this hypothesis.	NA
2023	1519	IR17	Police Violence in Protest Movements: Evidence from the United States	Under what conditions do democratic states repress during protests? While a large literature documents the behaviour and responses to these movements, work has yet to examine and expand upon theoretical explanations for variations in state responses. In this paper, I interrogate the link between political opportunity structures and aggressive protest policing. I argue police officers are more likely to apply aggressive policing toward protest movements conditional on ideology and local political climate. I test these expectations in the case of the United States, with granular data on protests and police interventions between 2017 and 2022.

2023	1610	BO057	How threatening is rectifying injustice? Public attitudes toward Indigenous self-determination policies in Norway and Sweden	Most states acknowledge the significance of Indigenous peoples’ right to self-determination as a provision of rectificatory justice. Yet, on the domestic level, the realization of that right is governed by national policies. In democratic societies, the question of the public’s opinion toward Indigenous self-determination is thus of great interest. Does the ethnic majority rather support or oppose policies facilitating self-determination, and to what extent? And are the Indigenous population’s policy preferences different? So far, very little is known about public attitudes toward Indigenous policies. I aim to contribute here by investigating opinions toward Indigenous policies among the ethnic majority and Indigenous Sámi populations of Norway and Sweden. In accordance with group threat theory, I hypothesize that the majority’s aversion should grow with the extent to which a policy facilitates Indigenous self-determination. In contrast, the Indigenous people should be more supportive of such policies. Preliminary results based on original survey data show a more nuanced picture. Even though the majority generally shows less support for self-determination-enhancing policies, it still prefers them over policies that substantially restrict Sámi self-determination.	NA
2023	298	BO057	How Race and Religion Impact Engagement in Congregational Racial Justice Efforts	In the summer of 2020, catalyzed by the killing of George Floyd, some places of worship more fully entered the conversation on race. Religious traditions have tools for conflict resolution, repentance, and even reconciliation. How are congregations using the tools of religion to engage questions of racial justice? Our answers come through a multimethod data set collected over two years: (a) surveys of 2,293 congregants from 35 diverse congregations find that race relations is the issue they most want their place of worship to address; (b) 90 sermons from 15 congregations reveal how clergy talked about race in the weeks after Floyd’s murder depended on racial background; and (c) 21 clergy interviews illustrate differences in how congregations use religion to engage on racial issues. These diverse data demonstrate that congregations are engaging in faith-based racial justice, but with important differences that fall along both racial and religious lines. Qualitative and quantitative evidence shows more frequent and deeper engagement in the issue of race from minority religious traditions—Muslims, Jews, and Baha’is—and from Black and multiethnic congregations.

2023	1311	BO058	Subjects, attainment or selection? Disentangling the effect of schooling on political beliefs in adulthood	The causal role of educational experiences in shaping political behaviour has received extensive attention in recent years. However, measurement of education is often limited in political surveys, with little detail beyond the highest level of qualification achieved. Consequently, it is often still a “black box”, with few possibilities to understand precisely how people’s education shapes their views in later life. We use new administrative and survey data to address this question. Specifically, we are able to link detailed administrative data on adults’ school records to their political views in a large-scale probability household panel survey, and analyse a succession of schooling reforms in England that affected the subjects offered to students in different schools. This allows us to understand whether it is the level of attainment, or rather the educational content and self-selection into different pathways that explain large effects of education on attitudes and electoral behaviour in England. Our results contribute to our understanding of the ways that educational expansion have shaped patterns of social and political conflict.	NA
2023	1374	BO058	Getting Into University and Getting Into Politics: How College Admission Affects Voter Turnout	The causal effect of education on political participation is a black box. Prior studies have increasingly been able to identify as-if random variation in educational attainment to establish that college education increases voter turnout. However, it remains a large empirical challenge to assess the mechanisms through which education affects political participation. The current study presents causally credible evidence on this question. Specifically, theories suggest that the peer composition and curriculum associated with different areas of study affects participation in politics by providing relevant resources and knowledge. To test these theories, I leverage a regression discontinuity in university admissions in Denmark that randomly assigns applicants on the margin to different majors. Using population-wide administrative data on both admissions and voting, I show whether social sciences, compared to other fields of study, provide an experience that is conducive to democratic engagement. Furthermore, some applicants are on the margin between being admitted to university in the given year or not. Using this margin, I investigate whether the effects of admission run through immediate socialization effects or longer term human/economic capital accumulation effects.	NA
2023	1510	BO058	Education as identity? A meta-analysis of education-based in-group vs out-group preferences in choice experiments	A catalogue of literature demonstrates that there is an education-based cleavage in the attitudes and preferences of citizens across a cohort of advanced democracies. Does education also serve as an indicator of an identity-based division with in-group and out-group prejudicial biases? This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of more than eighty (conjoint) experiments that vary the educational attainment of profiles across a variety of different political scenarios. We focus on those studies that include respondent-level education in order to test if education operates as a social identity that biases preferences towards of others to reflect education-based homophily. The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that education does indeed operate as social identity. The positive in-group and negative out-group bias is, however, not symmetric across individuals of different levels. Those with university-level education demonstrate, on average, far more group-based biases than those without a degree suggesting that part of the identity formation process results from advancing in education itself.

2023	482	BO058	The Effects of Higher Education Expansion on Political Cleavages: A Cohort-Level Analysis	This paper argues that the expansion of higher education (HE) has been highly consequential for the recent ‘tilt’ of politics towards the cultural axis and away from the redistributive one. Bringing together insights from the literature on value formation, educational choice and social mobility, I present a theoretical model that considers jointly the effects of familial income and libertarian-authoritarian values in the selection of individuals into HE, as well as the subsequent ‘allocation' of graduates into high-income positions. As this selection-and-allocation mechanism is iterated across generations with rising shares of HE participation, the model yields two predictions: cohorts with higher HE enrolment rates should present (1) higher levels of polarisation over cultural issues between graduates and non-graduates, and (2) lower levels of polarisation over redistribution between rich and poor. The theory is tested via the analysis of pseudo-panel data, where the attitudinal dependent variables are derived at country-cohort-period level for education and income groups via a Bayesian IRT model drawing from over 1m respondents surveyed in 36 countries over more than 30 years in a variety of cross-national surveys.

2023	841	BO058	Separation by Degrees. Social closure of the educated increases contemporary political divides.	In Europe, citizens with and without tertiary education hold different views on immigration and European integration, and increasingly vote for new left and far right parties. What explains education-based political divides? The dominant explanation in the literature holds that attending higher education ‘liberalizes’ people, but empirical evidence is mixed. This paper draws on sociological literature about social influence in networks to put forward a novel explanation. It argues that social closure of the educated increases contemporary political divides. In contrast to only a few decades ago, a large proportion of educated individuals surround themselves primarily with other educated individuals. This limits interaction opportunities and the formation of relationships between those with and without tertiary education. Using survey data from the ESS, and panel data from Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, we demonstrate that the education level of an individual’s parents, partner and wider network exerts an independent influence on their political attitudes and voting behaviour. Then, applying our networks approach to the mixed findings on liberalization effects, we show that often, education only liberalizes those from uneducated backgrounds.	NA
2023	1257	BO059	Political trust and redistribution preferences: evidence from randomised survey experiments and long-run panel data	Political trust has long been posited as fundamentally important for social co-operation, democratic survival, and for shaping preferences over a vast swathe ofpolicy areas. A substantial body of work addresses the link between political trust and preferences over government redistribution, yet the findings are mixed. In this paper, I reconcile these findings and shed new light on the importance of political trust. First, us-ing four pre-registered survey experiments, I show that experimentally-manipulatedtrust has no downstream consequences on individuals’ preferences over governmentspending. Second, I show using 19-year panel data from Switzerland that individuals’ changing trust judgements have no relationship with preferences over social spending or tax increases, but differences in trust judgements between people do. I suggest that cross-sectional evidence may be overstating the importance of trust, but experimental or panel evidence may understate it, leading to conflicting findings in the literature. Substantively, I argue trust is socialised in early-life and acts as a long-term ‘reservoir of support’ for government action.	NA
2023	1279	BO059	What is the effect of norm transparency on solidarity behavior? A cross-national experiment	Understanding the effects of transparency on compliance with social norms is vital to human cooperation. Transparency is usually regarded as a desirable normative property in democratic decision-making, ignoring that transparency about uncooperative agents can also crowd out good intentions. Therefore, this study tests how transparency about the norm of solidarity within a social group impacts solidarity behavior. It is argued that lacking transparency leads to moderate but stable levels of solidary, while transparency leads to unstable levels of high or low solidarity. To test these expectations, respondents play the Selten and Ockenfels (1998) solidarity game with ten repetitions in partner-matching with monetary rewards. In the limited transparency conditions, respondents are informed about their payoff and the payoff of their group members. In the full transparency condition, participants are informed about their payoffs and the solidarity behavior of their group members. The control group gets no feedback at all. The web-based interactive experiment is conducted on representative samples from Austria and Germany (N ~ 2,200). Findings of the pre-registered experiment will be presented, and their theoretical implications will be discussed.	NA
2023	900	BO059	Unequal Children Disgruntled Adults? The effect of exposure to inequalities during childhood on support for the political system in adulthood	It is a long-standing claim within political science that economic inequality leads to dissatisfaction with democracy and a concomitant distrust in politics and the state. Cross-national studies show a negative relationship between economic inequality and citizens’ political system support. However, these findings are vulnerable to bias from confounding. More recent studies using designs less vulnerable to confounding suggest that inequality has a limited impact on political system support. In this paper, we suggest that it is too early to dismiss the impact of inequalities on political system support. We argue that exposure to inequalities during one’s childhood and formative years leaves lasting marks on one’s political system support. We test this argument in Denmark, linking geo-referenced surveys to population data that enables us to create a range of neighborhood-level measures of inequality during respondents’ childhood and formative year. We look at a wide range of support for the political system measures, using different indicators of income inequalities, at different levels of aggregation.	NA
2023	927	BO059	Subjective Inequality and Regime Preferences: How Perceptions of Disadvantage Undermine Democratic Support	Subjective group-based relative deprivation (SGRD) is a powerful driver of political protest behaviour or exclusionary attitudes. Missing, however, is the crucial question whether perceived inequalities alter individuals’ preferences for democratic governance altogether. In our paper, we study if SGRD has the potential to undermine individuals’ support for a democratic regime. We argue that those perceiving their in-group as relatively deprived are likely to support democracy vis-à-vis authoritarian rule. Perceptions of being systematically disadvantaged fuel disaffection with and resentment against the prevailing democratic system, whereas authoritarian systems with their strongmen leadership appear appealing to individuals by promising stronger protection of the in-group and pursuing more confrontational in-group-out-group relations. Based on original survey data including a panel study from six European democracies between 2020 and 2022, we show that SGRD has the potential to undermine citizens' democratic support. This also holds for within-subject changes within individuals as shown by fixed-effects panel analyses. Our study highlights the negative impact of subjective inequality on support for democracy by combining literature from political psychology and political economy.	NA
2023	1197	BO060	Does Culture Matter for Gender Equality?	Does culture affect popular support for gender equality? Though it is widely assumed that culture matters for gender outcomes, evidence showing the causal effect of culture is still scarce. This is due to an important empirical challenge, which is to isolate culture from intervening factors, such as institutions and economic factors. This paper addresses this gap by exploiting an unique setting allowing to separate the effect of culture from other factors influencing citizens’ preferences. Specifically, I take advantage of Switzerland’s linguistic border, which sharply divides French and German language regions. Using language as a proxy for culture, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) to investigate the link between culture and local support for women’s voting rights. Analyzing the outcome of two national direct democratic votes on suffrage extension in 1959 and 1971, I find that support for female suffrage was significantly higher among voters living in French-speaking municipalities compared to voters in German-speaking municipalities. Additional analysis reveals that this cultural divide can also be observed in other issues touching gender equality.	NA
2023	1673	BO060	Risky War, Risky Peace: Revisiting the Gender Gap in Conflict Attitudes	While the common wisdom is that women are more peaceful than men, the evidence for this hypothesis in conflict zones is rather mixed. Therefore, we still lack theoretical framework to explain why such gaps might (or not) exist. This paper focuses on the role played by the psychological mechanism of risk aversion in shaping individual's attitudes towards war and peace, pointing to the varying levels of risk aversion between women and men that lead to gender gap(s) in security preferences. We use the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which attitudes toward military actions and peace plans constitute a major part of public opinion. We analyze observational data to examine the association between gender, risk-aversion, and attitudes towards conflict resolution and military actions along with an experimental design which manipulates the level of risk attached to each outcome in order to assess the effect of level-of-risk on women and men’s attitudes. Preliminary results support our mechanism. The paper contributes new insights to the study of the gender gap in popular support in peace and war in existing conflicts.	NA
2023	912	BO060	Populism and attitudes towards gender equality. The Spanish case	Existing evidence suggests that gender influences voting for populist parties, especially of the radical right, but systematic analyses are missing regarding the connection between populist attitudes and attitudes towards gender equality. To fill this gap, this research builds upon innovative survey data gathered in Spain in 2023 (N=1,500). It does so by recurring to an ideational approach to populism that makes it orthogonal to political ideology defined in economic and cultural terms, and using hostile/benevolent sexism to measure attitudes towards gender equality. Overall, three scenarios are considered and tested in the paper. First, populist attitudes and attitudes towards gender equality are unrelated to each other. Second, an association exists, but this is explained because more populist individuals are to be found at the extremes of the ideological axis, which includes the radical right that strongly opposed gender equality. Third, populism exerts a distinct effect on attitudes towards gender equality that is particularly visible among individuals displaying sets of attitudes associated with the radical right. These individuals will display stronger attitudes against gender equality than their less populist counterparts.	NA
2023	991	BO060	The Misinformation Gender Gap: Are Men More “Confidently Wrong” About Political Facts?	Recent advances in political knowledge and misinformation research suggest the need to take “confidence in knowledge” more seriously. Without measuring confidence in knowledge, in addition to the accuracy of the information one holds, we cannot distinguish the mere uninformed from the ones who are confidently wrong (the 'misinformed'). Previous studies have found that women are generally less confident in various domains such as science and finance, but little is known about political knowledge. When it comes to the accuracy of factual knowledge, it has been widely documented that women demonstrate a generally lower level of scores, but more recent studies have found it is not always the case. This paper aims to examine the presence and the extent of gender differences in the likelihood of being “confidently wrong” about factual political knowledge using an original survey in the UK that asked respondents’ confidence in their answers for each of the knowledge items they had to answer. The dataset also allows for examining the misinformation gender gap across domains of political knowledge and question formats.	NA
2023	1403	BO061	Swiping on left & right: a visual conjoint experiment on the consequences of political projection in the social world.	In-group biases drive citizens to prefer socialising with those we identify as 'one of us' over 'one of them'. In a fast-paced dating world where much interaction takes place online via platforms like Tinder, individuals may rely on visual heuristics to make advance judgements about whether a prospective romantic or sexual partner is likely “one of us” or not. Do political shortcuts, that result in the projection of group-based identities, shape individuals’ dating preferences? To answer this question, we leverage a pre-registered visual conjoint experiment manipulating AI-generated dating app profiles, assessing to what extent dynamics of assortative mating are being consolidated by political inferences individuals project onto others. The results of our visual conjoint, fielded among a well-powered cross-national representative sample of respondents from the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US, demonstrate that political projection does indeed result in assortative processes which are likely to exacerbate the affective polarisation that emerges from social sorting.

2023	1423	BO061	Ranked Choice Voting \& Minority Candidates' Electoral Chances	In recent years, Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) as an electoral reform has experienced momentum in the United States with an increasing number of states and cities introducing it. A common expectation is that RCV improves female and racial minority representation. However, while the literature is growing, we still have limited evidence on the political effects of RCV. In this paper, we estimate the impact of RCV on the electoral chances of women and racial minorities using difference in differences and data from California's local elections where four cities introduced RCV for certain political offices between 2004-2018. Our findings show a large, positive effect of RCV on the electoral chances of racial minorities in open-seat elections, but no effect on women. We further conduct a series of robustness checks for our results and study the mechanisms of these findings.	NA
2023	174	BO061	Physical Appearance and Elections in Finland: An Inequality Perspective	There seems to be a consensus that physically attractive candidates win elections more often. Unfortunately, very little is known about how voters evaluate candidates with socioeconomically (dis)advantageous “looks.” To bridge this gap, we study the electoral consequences of looking upper-class, middle-class, or working-class for candidates. Using official electoral data for the 2017 Finnish municipal elections and a novel dataset based on a representative sample of the Finnish population (N=7,920), we find that Finnish citizens systematically vote for candidates that look like they have upper-class occupations. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that there exists a systematic electoral penalty, particularly for female candidates that look like they have working-class occupations.	NA
2023	1749	BO061	Extremity and electability in party nomination contests	While many theories of polarization posit that voters in parties prefer candidates who take extreme issue positions, there is little evidence that shows how these preferences might vary over increasingly extreme positions. In this study, fielded on the 2020 CES, we use a conjoint experiment to unpack how voters react to a variety of extreme-to-moderate issue positions on a variety of issues, alongside more common biographical candidate information. As outcomes, we assess both candidate preference as well as perceptions of electability among voters, allowing us to unpack any strategic considerations voters might have. We find that voters reward candidates who position themselves as party-typical on most issues, but find little evidence that voters penalize ideologically extreme candidates, and may even penalize moderate ones.

2023	1788	BO062	The Effect of Increased Visibility on Radical Right Parties’ Electoral Gains	The rise of radical-right parties across democracies has prompted researchers to investigate the sources of their success. Factors such as the economy, immigration or identity politics are the usual suspects in this research stream. We know less about factors that contribute to the sustained growth of radical-right parties after an initial breakthrough. One argument holds that these parties benefit especially from the visibility that they gain when they win elections. The present study attempts to isolate the unique effect of visibility and overcome empirical limitations by focusing on the two-round system as applied in legislative and local elections in France. We use election data from 1978 to 2019 at the constituency and local level and leverage the quasi-random nature of runoff qualification in the French electoral system to gauge the effect of the presence of radical-right parties that barely crossed the threshold – and hence gained visibility without necessarily winning the election – on radical-right success in the closest next election. This study contributes to the broader literature on the conditions that explain the electoral success of radical-right parties.	NA
2023	1887	BO062	Consequences of Regional Electoral Success of Right-Wing Populist Parties for Immigrants’ Political Trust	Previous research shows that first-generation immigrants trust political institutions more than natives, but that this surplus becomes smaller with longer staying in the receiving societies and for the second generation. Drawing on research on the so-called integration paradox suggests that over time immigrants adapt their expectations to the host society. What remains largely unaddressed is that immigrants’ trust varies substantially across immigrant-receiving countries, which points to the role of differences in institutions and political representation. This study examines how national and regional institutional quality, as well as right-wing populist party success, influences immigrants’ political trust. Empirical results from multilevel models with macro-unit and time fixed effects using survey data from the European Social Survey (2008-2018) combined with regional and national data shows that increases in regional populist radical right party success relate to decreasing trust levels of immigrants, particularly for first-generation immigrants. Further analyses tracking potential mechanisms find that this relationship is largely due to increases in perceived discrimination and lack of political representation.	NA
2023	423	BO062	From Stigmatization to Normalization: Social Norms, Preference Falsification, and Radical Right Behavior	Why are individuals more willing to engage in radical-right behavior, such as voting for radical-right candidates or participating in xenophobic protests? Against previous research, this book project argues that this is not due to an increase in radical right preferences among the electorate. Instead, these increases are driven by individuals who had long held radical-right views, but who would not display them because they thought they were not socially acceptable. This self-sanctioning affected political supply, making worse candidates self-select into politics under a radical-right platform. Once better politicians start running in radical right platforms, they are able to mobilize the muted support for radical-right views. In so doing, voters learn that their views were more acceptable than they had previously thought, and become more comfortable publicly displaying their views. I test these expectations using novel measures, experiments, and sources of data which disentangle what individuals think in private from what they admit and do in public.	NA
2023	635	BO062	Right-wing populist parties and the rise of hate crimes	Do right-wing populist parties induce hate crimes? Western societies have witnessed a dramatic surge of hate crimes against minorities. We argue that right-wing populist parties (RPPs) have provided a breeding ground for racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and ultimately political violence. Based on social identity theory, we posit that RRPs mobilize support among an imagined in-group against a supposedly harmful out-group by employing aggressive rhetoric that depicts minorities as a threat which increases the readiness to commit hate crimes against minorities. We test our argument by leveraging a new dataset covering more than 70,000 hate crimes committed between 2010 and 2020 that we collected from police authorities in Germany. We rely on a difference-in-difference design that exploits the varying entry dates of the AfD into local legislatures to causally identify the effect of the AfD on hate crimes. To shed light on the mechanism, we analyze survey data on political attitudes and perform a quantitative text analysis of AfD social media posts. Our results have major implications for the debate on polarization, political violence and the consequences of radical right populism.	NA
2023	694	BO062	The consequences of scandals in radical-right populist parties: Exploiting a natural experiment in the Alternative for Germany’s donation affair	Political scandals are typically thought to have negative consequences for the involved actors and also for democracy more broadly (such as a decline in political trust). For radical-right populist parties (RRPPs), however, anecdotal evidence suggests that scandals may not have any of these consequences, but systematic evidence is lacking. In this study, I exploit a natural experiment, specifically an unexpected event during survey design, to causally identify the impact of scandals using the German Alternative for Germany as a case. As the party and its prominent figure Alice Weidel were involved in a party donation scandal which unfolded during the fieldwork of the ninth wave of the European Social Survey in 2018, the timing of the survey provides exogenous variation in respondents’ knowledge about the incident. The results show that there is no significant effect of the scandal on trust in politicians. Furthermore, there is no evidence for a moderating effect of sympathizing with the party. These findings have broader implications for research on political accountability since the RRPP’s misconduct is not punished, undermining this central democratic concept.	NA
2023	124	BO063	The Effects of Social Media during an Electoral Campaign: Can We Nudge Citizens to be Better Informed?	We conducted a field experiment during the 2022 French presidential election where randomly assigned participants agreed to deactivate their Facebook account. Half of the participants who deactivated Facebook received nudges aimed at reducing the uptake of misinformation and polarization. We measured their attitudes and behavior at three points during the election. We preregistered our hypotheses. Our (preliminary) results suggests that Facebook has relatively modest (but real) effects on political behavior. Our results corroborate some previous research, but not all.	NA
2023	1392	BO063	We all have a cross to bear. Social Media Strategies During Protests in Democratic Contexts	Recent research indicates that autocracies engage in information diffusion online to deal with threats arising from collective action. We ask whether this behavior is exclusive to authoritarian regimes, and to what extent. This study examines the prevalence of using social media as a tool to control public opinion outside autocracies. We argue that two types of threats can prompt politicians in democracies to deploy diffusion tactics on social media during protests akin to those employed by autocratic governments: (1) when they represent electoral threats to incumbents and (2) when they are about a salient issue on which parties disagree internally. Using topic modeling with Twitter data of political elites during popular protest events from the US, Colombia, and Chile, our results suggest that politicians in democracies attempt to shift the narratives away from protests when perceiving them as threats. Our results show that previous findings from autocratic contexts are not exclusive to non-democracies. This has implications for our understanding of elite behavior in the face of unrest and unveils potential threats in the context of democratic backsliding.	NA
2023	1783	PE15	Self-Exposure to Populist Media Content in Unequal Democracies: A Survey Experiment	Selling news is a tough business and media outlets increasingly rely on divisive and outrageous narratives to attract consumers’ attention. This trend developed while inequality was also on the rise. This paper asks: can these two phenomena be related? Could increasing inequality be breeding citizens’ appetite for populist media content? We explore this question through the lenses of political psychology and hypothesize that an increasing gap between the rich and the poor may be stimulating the success of populist media content. To test this question, we designed a survey experiment. Results from large Italian and UK samples show supporting evidence on our hypothesis — and highlight the important role of system justification in moderating the effect of inequality. These findings help us explain a possible mechanism linking inequality to the behavioral outcomes (such as electoral disengagement) that the previous literature on the politics of inequality has reported.

2023	1194	BO64	The effects of threat and blame frames on affective polarisation: a neuroscience experiment	In this paper, we analyse the role of emotions in affective polarisation through the lens of neuroscience. Our first question is if the framing of salient political issues in terms of threat or blame leads to stronger shifts in evaluations of particular political parties. If they do, this could strengthen a process known as affective polarisation. We analysed this on the basis of an experiment in which Dutch voters (N=1.872) were shown three different versions of videos on the issues of climate, immigration, and health care. These were embedded in a survey, which also measured emotional responses (12-item PANAS). Our second question is to what extent the effects observed are matched by polarised neural responses. We analysed this with an fMRI experiment using the same videos and examining subjects’ (N=25) inter-brain synchrony, where inter-subject correlations were predicted with party evaluation scores. The effects found for the blame framing suggest that anger does indeed play a role in polarised neural responses. These findings tell us that insight in brain processes can contribute to a better understanding of affective polarisation in politics.	NA
2023	1366	BO64	Varieties of Dislike - Using in-depth interviews to identify underlying dimensions of feeling thermometer responses in research on affective polarisation	Affective polarisation has become an issue of great concern across liberal democracies. Research on the potential causes and consequences of such growing political animosity is advancing rapidly, increasingly also focusing on multi-party systems. However, one of the core components of affective polarisation – dislike – remains fundamentally ambiguous and in need of further conceptual and empirical clarification. This paper presents an empirical study that uses semi-structured qualitative interviews to shed light on the negative evaluations, emotions and associations that individuals have when answering the dislike-based feeling thermometer questions used to measure affective polarisation. Asking respondents to elaborate on their survey responses, it tentatively shows that, 1) individuals can have multiple relevant political out-groups, 2) those out-groups are not considered homogenous - different evaluations are given to different sub-groups, mostly depending on perceived levels of ignorance, 3) initial answers are often relativized after deliberation, 4) dislike covers different discrete emotions, mainly moral emotions such as contempt and pity, which differ per out-group sub-type. The paper concludes by highlighting conceptual implications of those findings as well as implications for quantitative survey research on affective polarisation.	NA
2023	1611	BO64	Angry losers? The effects of electoral loss on partisan support for political violence and democratic norms	Peaceful transfers of power are a fundamental tenet of democracy. Even when one’s preferred party loses, voters should still uphold democratic norms and reject political violence. Yet, in times of heightened affective polarization, partisans may react to electoral loss by weakening their support for democratic norms. We test this idea through a pre-registered survey experiment conducted after the 2022 US mid-term elections. We randomly assign Republican and Democrat partisans to receive either a placebo or an electoral loss prime in the form of a newspaper article and an open-ended survey question. All respondents then engage in a filler task before proceeding to the political violence and democratic norms questions. Within the electoral loss treatment, we also vary which emotion, anger or anxiety, is primed, allowing us to test whether partisan anger leads to stronger support for political violence and democratic norm breaking than partisan anxiety. By linking the study of partisan emotions to affective polarization, this paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of why and when partisans are ready to adopt beliefs that are harmful to democracy.

2023	789	BO064	At the root s of citizens’ discontent: an emotion-based cross-cultural perspective on affective polarization	This research project aims to identify the mechanisms underlying affective polarization (AP) by using an innovative interdisciplinary approach that combines Political Science and Cross-Cultural Psychology. Our goal is to understand how country-specific values influence the strength and the shape of negative emotions driving AP. We argue that the key to understanding how affective polarization works, why it occurs, and how it can be tackled, is to try to understand why it varies so dramatically from country to country. Two elements are central in the mechanism we propose: the variations of values and (hence) the variation of emotions. Following a cross-cultural psychology argument, we propose that cultural norms will regulate the emotions linked to AP (e.g. anger and fear), and that positive partisanship acts as a moderator.We test this mechanism by using an online survey (about 1000 respondents per country) fielded in twelve European Western Democracies.

2023	946	BO64	Explaining the gender gap in political tolerance: identity, affective polarization, and emotions.	This article documents a gap in Affective Polarization levels and political tolerance between men and women- with women scoring lower in tolerance than men- to subsequently explore the reasons behind these differences. Through a mixed methods approach, leveraging a unique representative polarization survey fielded in Spain (N=2938) and focus groups to explore polarization and tolerance as they unfold in everyday discourses, we explore the causes behind this gap. In so doing, the paper contributes to the debate on gender differences in political tolerance, which has generated mixed evidence. Furthermore, the paper also provides new insights into gender differences in affective polarization and how they relate to political tolerance. Results point to the importance of politicized identities and emotions to explain the degree of positivity and negativity towards political groups, as well as people’s agreement or disagreement to limit their main out-group’s political expression. The results raise normative concerns about current understandings of affective polarization and political tolerance as well as their consequences. Moreover, the results point to the need to discuss the relevance of considering power relations between groups when trying to assess inter-group dynamics of negativity and conflict.	NA
2023	1492	BO65	Becoming trapped by climate change? Linking migration aspirations to actual moves among a climate-vulnerable population in Bangladesh	While the academic literature agrees that climate change will alter migration patterns, it has been inconclusive about how it will do so. For examining how environmental changes translate into migration, one needs to consider both migration aspirations and the ability to move of affected populations. We investigate which factors condition whether environmental changes lead to actual moves by collecting primary survey panel data of 1700 households residing along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. We assess baseline migration aspirations of a population at risk of being affected by riverbank erosion and floods. Re-interviewing the same population after erosion and floods have materialized, we can assess whose aspirations turned into actual moves and whose did not. We find that migration materializes only for a small fraction of those who had expressed a desire to move at baseline. Socio-economic status and social networks are important conditioning factors influencing an individual’s ability to move. Our findings have significant policy implications since they provide guidance how to support the most vulnerable parts of populations at risk of becoming trapped in unfavorable environmental conditions.

2023	640	BO65	Going solar? Testing the influence of education on willingness to invest in solar community projects	In addition to the long-lasting urgency to tackle climate change and to transition to renewable energies, the Ukraine war has reinforced the need to rapidly reduce energy dependence and strengthen national possibilities to produce energy themselves. Solar PV enjoys high societal support and thus offers a fast and promising way to address these challenges. However, in countries with extremely low house ownership quotes like Switzerland, private solar plant installation might not suffice. Solar community projects are therefore seen as an auspicious opportunity that introduce a market-based solution, offering investment possibilities to all citizens, independent of house ownership. However, not much is known about how these projects should be designed, e.g., regarding location, project ownership, or reimbursement, to attract private investment. Further, not all groups might react identically, posing the need to differentiate between e.g. education groups in order to maximize acceptance of and investment in solar power. This study presents novel data collected in September and October 2022, and particularly tests how different education groups react to varying solar community project designs. Preliminary conjoint analyses suggest non-homogeneous education class effects.	NA
2023	961	PC16	Unequal Reporting on Climate-Change in News Worldwide: An Amplification of the Domestic Cleavage?	Climate change is one of today’s most pressing problems. Yet, most governments are sluggish when it comes to climate action. One reason is that public opinion on climate change is increasingly polarized in most countries. While a predominantly young and well-educated segment of society pushes for far-reaching climate action, others are not ready to go along. One actor that plays a substantial role in this process is the media. Since media reporting can, among others, highlight the unequal consequences of climate change for today’s youth (inter-generational inequality) or rather focus on the unequal consequences of climate policies that, if not compensated, imply an unequal burden for today’s poor (intra-society inequality), different inequalities inherent in climate change (policies) can be either exacerbated or reduced in media reporting. In this paper, we investigate how different types of media portray this issue and whether media framing can exacerbate societal rifts with regard to climate action. We tackle this question relying on a comparative media analysis using multilingual dictionaries based on newspaper articles from 16 countries, 26 newspaper outlets from 2013-2020.	NA
2023	1424	BO66	What makes it personal? The relationship between political and social manifestations of affective polarization	While research on affective polarization is thriving, it has remained somewhat unclear whether the concept is best captured by feelings towards political parties, party elites or party supporters. I propose a distinction between the political and social manifestations of affective polarization, the former signifying polarized emotions towards parties/party elites and the latter towards party supporters. Some studies have shown that although affective polarization is stronger regarding the former, at least some of the party-related feelings spill over into social sphere. However, we know little about such social manifestations of affective polarization outside the US context. Moreover, it is unclear how strong is the relationship between the two manifestations, and which factors moderate this linkage. Using original survey data gathered in France, Italy, Hungary and Estonia, I aim at addressing these research gaps. I map the levels of and correlations between affective polarization as measured by party like-dislike ratings, partisan stereotyping and social avoidance items. I also study a range of identity-, ideology- and valence-related attitudes that could affect the extent to which feelings towards parties leak into social sphere.	NA
2023	41	BO66	The Urban-Rural Divide and Residential Contentment as Antecedents of Political Ideology	We explore the foundations of the well-documented urban-rural political gulf in the United States and other western democracies, theorizing that it is anchored in the variable extent of residents’ satisfaction and place attachment. Consistent with a long tradition of sociological findings, we first demonstrate that attachment to one’s neighborhood of residence is much higher among rural populations than in big cities. This variation in place attachment is ultimately an important font of political and policy attitudes, accounting for the gaping ideological differences between urban and rural areas. Politically relevant grievances arise most acutely when they are shared, as prevailing conditions in specific social environments. The more dissatisfied one is with the place they live, the more attractive they find the policy goals and political agenda of liberal progressivism in US politics. Greater contentment with place, on the other hand, is predictive of politically conservative viewpoints.	NA
2023	716	BO66	Multiple social identities and affective polarization in multiparty systems: Evidence from a conjoint experiment in five countries	While existing research on affective polarization in multi-party systems has shed light on a variety of individual-level drivers, we know less about voters’ responses when partisan and other political and social identities are primed simultaneously. To examine this question, we fielded conjoint experiments in five countries differentially affected by a number of cross-cutting cleavages (Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Our respondents were asked to choose among hypothetical profiles of families moving to live next door, whose attributes varied along a number of characteristics including voting behavior, ideology, ethnic identity, education and other context-relevant features. Through random assignment of hypothetical profiles, we therefore varied the extent to which the additional political and social identities primed in the experiment overlap or not with partisan identity, so that social sorting dynamics and their impact on respondents’ social preferences can be evaluated. Our results inform our understanding of how individuals react to multiple identity primes and how this relates to affective polarization.	NA
2023	782	BO66	Are people in more politically homogenous areas more affectively polarized?	Alongside social and ideological sorting, one of the explanations for affective polarisation is residential segregation by partisanship. The ‘Big Sort’ has meant that neighbourhoods in the US have become more homogenous in terms of vote. Yet while there is a developing literature on the factors which make this partisan residential homogenization more likely, and the extent to which this is due to partisans seeking out fellow partisans, there is no evidence on whether homogenous partisan neighbourhoods actually influence affective polarisation. Does living cheek by jowl with fellow partisans make someone more positive towards their own side and more negative towards the other side? In this paper, we use unique data from Britain to show that while people accurately recognise that their local area is more or less politically homogenous, neighbourhood political homogeneity is not correlated with any measure of affective polarization. These findings are robust to the type of political divide (Brexit or party), the level of geography and controls for ideology and social characteristics. We suggest that geographical sorting is therefore not a major cause of affective polarization.	NA
2023	1316	BO67	Ideological Polarization Across Rural Urban Europe	Media portrayals of rifts in issue attitudes between rural and urban areas abound. Yet empirical evidence on the geographic polarization of mass opinion in Europe remains scarce. We address this gap by estimating the issue domain-specific conservatism of hundreds of thousands self-reported rural and urban dwellers over four decades. For this we integrate multiple attitude questions from 223 rounds of public opinion surveys fielded in 30 countries. Acknowledging the multifaceted nature of ideological polarization, we conceptualize polarization in terms of consistency and divergence of conservatism both across (sorting, overlap) and within (constraint, heterogeneity) subgroups. We develop a Bayesian heteroscedastic graded response model that accounts for non-equivalence of questions across countries and that allows for the joint measurement of complimentary perspectives on polarization. Applying our model to assess economic, immigration, moral, and family value conservatism, our findings suggest that contemporary media narratives and existing studies overstate the extent of ideological polarization across rural-urban Europe. Our study contributes unprecedented insights into temporal and regional dynamics of ideological polarization in Europe that are relevant to current debates on inequality and representation.	NA
2023	1468	BO67	Rural-Urban versus Center-Periphery: Identities, Polarization, and Policy Preferences	How do geographic attachments shape polarization and policy preferences? Previous scholarship has identified a rural-urban divide and measured place-based resentment in the American context. Relatedly, research has also pointed at resentment toward capital cities as decisive for political preferences, which does not need to come from rural areas and is not aimed at all cities. We therefore bring back another geographic division into the debate: center versus periphery. What is the difference between these two geographic divides? Leveraging original survey data from Norway, we construct latent measures of rural-urban and center-periphery identities based on the strength of an individual’s attachment to these places. We then explore the extent of polarization between these identities. Using survey experiments, we examine how this polarization affects preferences for more localized versus centralized public goods provisioning. Our work helps to better understand the subnational territorial cleavage in Western democracies.	NA
2023	1700	BO67	Perceptions of the centre-periphery conflict and their impact on attitudes towards multilevel government	The centre-periphery conflict has a big impact on several individual attitudes such as voting behaviour, trust in government, and satisfaction with the political system. However, citizens’ perceptions of this conflict have not been explored systematically with regards to its impact on the perceived legitimacy of public policy decisions taken in a multilevel democracy. We analyse attitudes of Norwegian citizens through a survey experiment fielded to 1,200 respondents. Revealing that these perceptions indeed have an effect on the perceived legitimacy of policy decisions in Norway would imply that unitary countries are somewhat comparable to federal and regionalised countries. We hypothesise that citizens who have more peripheral attitudes to value subnational governments more, and that they will be more willing to accept decisions made by the national government if the subnational tiers indicate support for the decision. The results reveal that centre-periphery perceptions have an impact on how and to what extent diffuse support for multilevel governance translates into specific support for policy decisions. Our findings are important as they shed light to varying attitudes towards multilevel government in unitary countries.	NA
2023	1913	BO67	The Causes of the Urban-Rural Cleavage in Green Voting: Evidence from Germany	Recent studies highlight the rising relevance of the geographical cleavage in the configuration of electoral politics. It is often suggested that the Greens are the party family most affected by the urban-rural divide. However, until now the reasons for the urban-rural cleavage in green voting has not been explored. This article attempts to elucidate whether the division between cities and urban areas in green voting exists at the individual level, and which are the causes accounting for this potential divide. For this purpose, a propensity score matching and a cross sectional time series designs are applied to analyse the German case. The results indicate that there is a significant urban-rural polarization in green voting, and that compositional effects, rather than contextual factors, explain this cleavage. Moreover, attitudes towards the environment seem to act as an important mechanism linking social characteristics with green voting. These findings have important implications for understanding the wider consequences of postindustrial economic and cultural transformations and the effects of ecological degradation on political behaviour.

2023	1551	BO69	Fundamental Measurement of Party Preference Orders in the German Multiparty System at the Occasion of the 2021 Federal Election: Description and Explanation	We extract preference orders for the German electorate based on pairwise comparisons. Application background is the 2021 German Federal Election with six parties entering the parliament: AfD, CDU/CSU, FDP, Greens, Linke, SPD. Accounting for indifferences we identify the frequencies of typical orders as well as of intransitivities. Of major interest will be whether the left-right dimension can be identified as an underlying joint scale, or whether there are several dimensions or subpopulations. Based on rank ordered logit models we statistically explain the preference orders with prominent electoral research variables (e.g. candidate evaluations, party evaluations, issue positions, coalition preferences).

2023	1896	BO69	Re-evaluating the extent of strategic voting	Citizens may approach voting strategically, by considering how their vote is likely to affect outcomes, or sincerely, by simply voting for their preferred candidate. Researchers typically measure the extent of strategic voting by looking for discrepancies between voters' preferences and their vote choices. But such discrepancies may arise either because the voter defects from her preferred candidate or because the researcher incorrectly measures the voter's preferences. Using a set of new survey measures of preferences, we show that previous research has overstated the prevalence of strategic voting, particularly in elections conducted under proportional representation.

2023	253	BO69	How Do People Vote under Preferential Voting? An Experiment on Voting Behavior and Computational Complexity	How does the computational complexity of an electoral system affect people's voting behavior? We ran a laboratory experiment to compare people's voting behavior under Preferential Voting (known for its computational complexity) and the Borda Count (same ballot structure, but less computationally complex). We find that a smaller proportion of strategic votes is cast under Preferential Voting than under the Borda Count. We also find that participants who scored higher on a post-experiment numeracy test voted strategically in greater proportion. When a vote is repeated, more participants change their vote under Preferential Voting, which is consistent with its greater computational complexity. Finally, we identify three heuristics that have been adopted by the participants: (1) sincere voting; (2) conformity to the votes cast by the other participants; and (3) inversion at the top of the ballot. Our findings suggest that participants respond to computational complexity by adopting in greater proportion the inversion-at-the-top heuristic rather than by voting sincerely. Our findings have interesting implications for the implications of computational complexity on preference aggregation.	NA
2023	325	BO69	School's Out! Information Cues and Retrospective Voting in the Case of School Closures in Sweden	While research provides evidence that voters' consider governments' past performance, little is known about which information voters pay attention to. We suggest two competing theories of retrospective voting: Outcome-oriented voters only react to the policy outcome, whereas position-oriented voters consider the initial proposal as informative of the incumbent’s policy position and punish them for the unpopular idea. We test these opposing mechanisms using the case of widely unpopular school closures and originally compiled granular data on Swedish local elections results from 2002 to 2018. We exploit within municipality variation in voting across time to causally estimate the consequences for incumbents in the neighborhood surrounding the schools. Our results confirm that voters punish incumbents for closing a school but also for withdrawing the proposal: they vote position-oriented. Our findings have implications for the understanding of retrospective voting and which information cues voters look back to.	NA
2023	418	BO69	Competing or Complementary? Local and National Competitiveness as Explanatory Factors of Turnout in SMP Systems	Rooted in the rational choice theory, high stake elections are considered to attract more voters than elections where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Although measures of national level electoral competitiveness are often thought to suffice when researching proportional electoral systems, this is not the case in countries with single-member districts. Voters in single member plurality systems are likely to (also) take into account the closeness of the race in their constituency when deciding to turn out to vote or not. This paper aims to shed light on the nature of the relationship – whether competing or complementary – of local and national competitiveness on voter turnout in single member plurality systems. It does so based on the combined British Elections Studies from 1964 to 2019 to which information on the level of electoral saliency at the constituency and national level have been added. This unique dataset not only permits addressing the extent to which local and national competitiveness influence turnout in national elections. It also allows assessing which measures of competitiveness matter more or less.	NA
2023	135	BO70	Threat, Emotions, and the Erosion of Democracy.	It is widely believed that emotions guide democratic orientations and attitudes in times of crises and external threat. Extending recent research, we develop a domain specific logic of threat-induced emotions, arguing that anger is related to the political domain and a waning of political support, while fear is more associated with the social domain and an erosion of social cohesion. We find evidence for this logic in a randomized experiment on the threat of infectious diseases - COVID-19 and monkeypox - among a representative sample of 2,800 adults in Germany. Moreover, this logic contributes to our understanding of the role of anger in the formation of conspiracy beliefs as a current challenge to democracy. Additional analyses of comprehensive survey data from six countries (N=18,000) corroborate the experimental evidence and suggest that our findings are generalizable to different contexts. Our study has crucial implications because seminal studies on political culture stress that political support and social cohesion are critical to the survival of democracy. In times of global threats, the issue is even more pressing.	NA
2023	514	BO70	Threatened by what? Global public opinion research on perceptions of societal challenges to contemporary societies	From a scientific perspective, major challenges like migration, climate change, or social inequality threaten contemporary societies around the world. Yet, what is actually perceived as challenge might differ between individuals and countries. Research on societal threat perceptions is rather scarce – especially from a comparative viewpoint. However, understanding such perceptions better and determining to which degree perceived threats differ between as well as within countries can help to identify current and future sources of conflict or political mobilisation. In this study, we explore citizens’ perceptions of societal threats, whether they are primarily economic, political, or cultural in nature, and how differences in perceptions can be explained. We use newly collected public opinion data from thirty countries from all over the world with more than 60,000 respondents and a novel measurement instrument to analyse citizens’ perceptions of threats. We expect substantial variation due to (1) individual characteristics like socio-demographics, political ideology, and value orientations; (2) contextual characteristics such as democratic quality, economic development, and polarization; and (3) interactions between individual characteristics and contextual factors.

2023	710	BO70	Can emotions explain how threat rhetoric shapes preferences for freedom versus security?	Threat rhetoric shapes policy preference formation. While the relation of this link is becoming a stylized fact, the underlying causal mechanism remains unclear. We argue that strategic emotional appeals in threat rhetoric evoke different emotions within the receiver, which in turn mediate the support for policies on the freedom-security nexus. Based on the theoretical model of appraisal and dimensions of affective response, we expect that threat situations described as uncertain trigger anxiety and turn policy preferences towards security. In contrast, a threat situation described as under control is violating norms and leads to anger which enhances freedom preferences. Applied to the case of migration in Germany we conduct a survey experiment with a treatment based on media articles. We employ a novel parallel encouragement design for a causal mediation analysis. This design allows for experimental manipulation of the mediator, which provides a strong causal identification strategy. The paper contributes to the in-depth understanding of how strategic threat rhetoric impacts democratic preferences by European citizens. We extend existing knowledge by investigating the mediating effect of emotions.	NA
2023	973	BO70	The Far Right and Public Opinion: Lone Wolves or a Collective Threat?	How does the ideological motive behind a security threat affect public opinion?Previous research has shown that outgroup biases and prejudices influence the threat perception of citizens in Western democracies. Individuals are more likely to identify a crime as terrorism and to support the use of extraordinary detention practices when committed by a Muslim than by White supremacists. This study analyses the causal effect of ideology on individuals’ threat perception and support for restrictive state countermeasures. Based on ingroup and outgroup explanations, I argue that while extreme right threats are perceived as incidents committed by lone actors, Islamist threats are perceived as a collective thread associated with the broader group of Muslims. Empirically, I draw on experimental evidence from a representative sample of the German population. By conducting a 2 x 2 between subjects’ experiment, I test the influence of the ideological motive on perceptions of threats and extremism and support for restrictive counter measures. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how prejudices shape public opinion and policy preferences.	NA
2023	1100	1100	In (Which) News We Trust: Fake News and the Downstream Effects of Differential Institutional Trust	Issues of media freedom and fake news intersect broadly with de-democratizing trends within backsliding European Union member states. Hungary is one of several countries where partisans on all sides make claims about ‘fake news’ and the risks of political dis- and misinformation. However, these similar claims have different partisan valences and those have major impacts on trust in European and domestic institutions. The autocratizing national government emphasizes fake news coming from the rest of Europe, outside Hungary (as well as from “foreign-backed” journalists), while the opposition points to fake news coming from inside Hungary, as a result of the government’s heightened control of the media environment. Using data from an original survey fielded just prior to the April 2022 national election, we examine how partisan differences in perceptions of fake news affect other aspects of elections, participation, and campaigning in Hungary and to represent how this challenge could play out in other European Union members in a worst-case scenario.

2023	240	BO71	Covid-19 response and political trust: the case of Nepal	The COVID-19 pandemic reinvigorated debates about the effects of governments’ performance on political trust. First empirical evidence points to the existence of a rally-around-the-flag-effect whereby individuals react to uncertainty with higher levels of trust. However, these analysis have mostly focused on national-level institutions, during the early stages of the pandemic and using data from consolidated democracies. This paper contributes to the literature by looking beyond immediate effects and exploring the association between individuals’ satisfaction with COVID-19 performance of local level institutions and political trust in Nepal. For that, it uses novel data collected via telephone interviews (N=1,400) conducted between April and May 2021, during the 2nd wave of COVID-19. Main results reveal that satisfaction with local institutions’ COVID-related performance is significantly and robustly associated with higher levels of political trust at the local level. These results suggest that not only psychological effects triggered by unexpected crisis but also performance can explain increases in political trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study thereby provides important insights on the role performance plays beyond the national level and in unconsolidated political systems.	NA
2023	410	BO71	Executive Approval During Times of Crisis	Leaders’ approval ratings provide a continuing referendum on their actions, conditioning future decision-making. While we generally understand the general drivers and cyclical dynamics of approval of presidents and prime ministers, we know less about approval under extraordinary circumstances. Existing work does not capture the complexity of the public response to leader performance under the stress of a crisis on the order of the COVID-19 pandemic or prolonged interstate conflicts with ripple effects across many democracies, like the war in Ukraine. During these times, neither cyclical dynamics nor a simple reward-punishment hypothesis – that citizens approve of leaders who perform well and disapprove of those who perform badly – are likely to remain consistent over time. In this paper we extend and adapt arguments on the drivers of executive approval to test how leader popularity moves during four types of crisis: economic, security, natural disaster, and public health. To test arguments, we pair quarterly time series data on executive approval from over fifty countries across 25 years with measures on the presence, severity, and spillover potential of crisis events.

2023	53	BO71	Bureaucracy Bashing and Perceptions of Public Employees	In popular fiction and the news media, the words “government” and “bureaucracy” are often used interchangeably to describe the administrative state. However, these terms carry distinct connotations, which we argue have diverging second-order effects on how citizens view public employees of the administrative state. Indeed, the term “bureaucracy” has a pejorative etymology, dating back to the eighteenth century when the term was coined to disparage governments run by unelected administrators and desk jockeys. Based on the term's history, we hypothesize that bureaucratic depictions of public employees should negatively affect survey respondents' perceptions of their trustworthiness and competence. We test this hypothesis with two separate equivalence framing experiments and find that describing public employees as either “bureaucrats” or “government bureaucrats” instead of “government employees” leads respondents to view them as significantly less trustworthy and more corrupt. We further examine our results for heterogeneous treatment effects across several key political predispositions and find that respondents who are low in social dominance orientation (SDO) are more likely to change their attitudes toward public employees in response to bureaucratic depictions.

2023	559	BO71	People’s (lack of) trust in politicians: A conjoint experiment on the effect of being 'labeled' as politician	Today, many citizens think of politicians as dishonest, power-hungry and self-interested individuals (Citrin & Stoker, 2018). Yet, it is often argued that it is not inherently problematic if the public has little trust in politicians because they can be replaced every electoral cycle (e.g., Dalton, 2004; Norris, 2011). This assumes that people reset their level of trust in new politicians to a neutral baseline level. But do they? Using a conjoint experiment (n~1500; fielded in Belgium in Spring 2023), the proposed study would uncover if people’s trust in politicians is driven by them being or becoming politician for a living – rather than by what they stand for or how they behave. It allows to see if merely being politician makes them seen as untrustworthy by the general public. For instance, do people have less trust in politicians whose opinions align with their own compared to citizens with a different profession whose opinions differ from their own? If so, this could have far-reaching implications for the quality of representation, the role of elections, and democracy as rule by the people.	NA
2023	1009	BO72	Conceptualising and measuring support for liberal democracy across the world	Public support for a democratic system of government is thought to be one of the main bulwarks against democratic backsliding. Yet almost everything we know about support for democracy is based on survey measures which are generally agreed to be limited, if not deeply flawed. Our understanding of support for democracy, its causes, and its consequences for democracy, is therefore more questionable than we would like to admit. In response, we propose a new approach to measuring support for democracy. Instead of asking people about their approval of “democracy”, an abstract and complex concept, we propose asking instead about public approval of the more granular rights, institutions, and processes which collectively constitute “liberal democracy”. We argue that this approach will: embed public support for democracy within the concept of liberal democracy; provide for more tangible and valid measures; and permits insight into the particular features of liberal democracy which publics find the least compelling. Our set of items is tested and validated in samples from more than a dozen countries.	NA
2023	1036	BO72	Political Exclusion and Support for Democracy	Voting is the least unequal form of political participation as regardless of resources all individuals have only one vote. However, this perception disregards the rising number of inhabitants in democratic countries that cannot vote at national elections. This exlusion not only affects those below the voting age but also those with foreign citizenship. For example, in Germany, about 8 million inhabitants of voting age that largely follow the same obligations as other citizens are deprived of the most essential form of political participation. How does the exclusion from basic rights affect individuals’ support for democracy, the democratic system and its institutions? We rely on data from the DeZIM.panel, a random sampled, online access panel of the German residential population, oversampling immigrants with more than 3,000 participants, using two recent waves fielded one year apart. We analyse how electoral exclusion relates to specific and diffuse support for democracy compared to similar individuals with citizenship. We argue that withholding the right to vote puts a political system at risk of losing its fundamental basis of support – a great danger for a democracy.	NA
2023	1234	BO72	Social Desirability Bias as Substance and Not Nuisance	Social scientists have long debated the question of how threatening social desirability biases are for what scientists can learn from survey respondents. Until today such biases are treated as a nuisance at best. In contrast, we argue that social desirability biases are key to understand for social scientists as they are important proxies for social norms and the need for conformity within societies. We compare six different designs to measure social desirability bias in relation to support for democracy in three European countries. Besides a list experiment, we rely on various approaches that trigger respondents' need to provide socially acceptable answers. We show that triggering social desirability is outperforming list experiments and observational measures for various reasons. Most importantly it allows researchers to test whether social desirability is actually manipulated. It also ensures that social desirability is not treated as a nuisance but as a matter of substantive research interest.	NA
2023	717	BO72	The social foundation of democracy	Survey evidence demonstrates democracy’s continuing popularity in Western societies. But can we trust these findings? How firm are democracy’s societal foundations really when democratic beliefs are put under pressure? We argue that support for democracy is best understood as a social attitude that reflects perceived opinions in a person’s social environment. As such, under contemporary circumstances, social mechanisms help reinforce widespread support for democracy but in a downward spiral the popularity of democracy may quickly crumble once exogenous shocks visibly undermine popular support. To test these predictions, this Registered Report introduces a new experimental paradigm to the study of democracy’s societal foundations. Revising Ash-style conformity experiments and applying them to democratic attitudes in a conversational setting we will bring Norwegian citizens together in small groups for political and unpolitical conversations. In each of these groups, we will randomly vary the numbers of confederates who will adopt pro- or anti-democratic stances. This research design will help us explore whether ordinary citizens remain committed supporters of democracy even in a social environment that is hostile to democracy.	NA
2023	1331	BO68	Ethnic minority voters in Britain and the puzzle of 'necessity liberalism'	Ethnicity is one of the largest electoral cleavages in British politics, including at the 2016 Brexit referendum. But the causes of this gap are mostly assumed and not analysed, due to a lack of suitable data. The guiding assumption has been that behind ethnic minorities' overwhelming support for Remain lay a rejection the ethnocentric Leave campaign, which minorities found threatening. This placed minority voters within the same camp as white voters who rejected the ethnocentric Leave camp on the basis of their convictions, rather than a sense of threat, thus leading to the hypothesis that minorities are 'liberals' by necessity, as opposed to conviction. We use data from a new ethnic minority booster to the 2019 British Election Study to test exactly how liberal minority voters are, on what measures and under which conditions. Evidence from these data is consistent with the necessity liberalism hypothesis, and once we account for necessity liberalism of minority voters, we find there is no ethnic gap in how people voted on 23rd of June 2016.

2023	172	BO75	Voting for or against? A longitudinal and global empirical study	Many political commentators have hypothesized that citizens are increasingly voting against the parties and candidates that they do not like instead of voting for those that they indeed like. Although this statements has important normative implications for democracy, it has not been systematically tested at the global level. Using CSES survey data, we find that although respondents are not less likely to vote for their favorite party than 30 years ago, they tend to likes less and less the parties for which they vote. This is part of a more general trend of decreasing party likings across the board. Further, we explore the democratic implications of this trend for democracy by checking its association with representation and accountability.	NA
2023	276	BO75	The Conditional Effects of Vote Method on Confidence in Elections	Might voters’ experience with how they usually vote condition their confidence in ballots being accurately counted? We are interested in how (un)familiarity with a voting modality may shape voters’ confidence in elections, particularly when faced with allegations by elites challenging the legitimacy of the electoral process. Drawing on a large panel survey of validated voters conducted before and after the 2020 General Election, we find that mail voters were more confident that votes would be accurately counted than those who usually vote in person, despite elites repeated claims that mail ballots were fraudulent. We also find that those who voted by mail in the 2020 election became more confident that votes were accurately counted. This study challenges existing research examining voting and confidence in elections and suggests that voters are willing to rebuff elite cues disavowing their usual voting practice.	NA
2023	301	BO75	Does Schooling Increase Political Belief Accuracy?	Citizens must hold accurate beliefs about politically-relevant facts to preserve democratic representation, accountability and legislation. We theorize that, abstracting from one's background, schooling per se does not trigger the epistemological sophistication necessary to get a grasp of the political world. In this paper, we study whether schooling improves the accuracy of factual beliefs about the share of foreigners and unemployed, later in life. We derive an appealing metric of belief accuracy, matching survey respondents' beliefs with the corresponding real-world datum at the time of the interview in their country, retrieving high levels of inaccuracy in both issues. More educated individuals display higher belief accuracy, most likely due to selection, rather than causality: compelling otherwise-dropouts to stay in school by extending compulsory education entails a null effect on belief accuracy, in both issues. Taken together, cross-sectional and causal estimates suggest that education is necessary, but not sufficient, to contrast inaccurate beliefs.	NA
2023	408	BO75	The political consequences of polarization: Quasi-experimental evidence from runoff elections	Polarization among parties has been increasing in many advanced democracies. While literature on the consequences of polarization is burgeoning, these studies typically face two concerns: endogeneity and omitted variables. I contribute to this literature and argue that polarization among candidates can affect the functioning of democracy by fostering voters’ coordination around incumbents thus decreasing turnover. I test the hypotheses by applying a Regression Discontinuity Design to data from legislative and cantonal elections in France. These elections use a two-round system in which the two most voted candidates in the first round automatically qualify for the second round. Following the logic of ‘close race elections’, I compare cases in which the runner-up candidate that barely qualifies for the second round polarizes the election, with cases in which that candidate did not qualify, decreasing the degree of polarization. I find that polarization decreases incumbent turnover by fostering voters' coordination around them. This effect is particularly strong when polarization comes from the presence of extreme candidates in the second round. These results have clear implications for our understanding of the consequences of polarization.	NA
2023	1154	BO74	You and Whose Economy?:The Neglected Role of In-group Economic Perceptions	Since its inception, the economic voting literature has attempted to answer the question of whether voters are sociotropic and care about the state of the national economy, or egotropic and just care about their own pocketbook. There is however a third option that has received much less attention: that voters care about the economic conditions of their social in-group. In this paper, I provide a theoretical framework and first experimental test of how voters react to changes to the economic conditions of their social in-group that is independent of their own pocketbook. I implement a pre-registered and replicated survey experiment that uses true economic information about social groups to manipulate respondents’ group-level economic perceptions across 22 different class-, age-, geographical and education-groups. I find evidence that voters exhibit a unique negative reaction to in-group economic decline, in particular when the decline is relative to the national economic trend. Effects persist for both satisfaction with the economy and vote choice. These findings suggest that we have underestimated the importance of social group attachments to the way voters think about the economy.	NA
2023	1189	BO74	A Distorting Mirror: Ideological preferences and mis-perceptions of economic inequality	Economic inequality is highly debated nowadays, yet little political action has been taken to tackle increasing economic disparities. Scholars have argued that one explanation might be people’s distorted perception of income inequality. The origins of this mis-perception are still unclear. Specifically, the role of ideology remains under-explored and the little research focuses almost exclusively on the United States. However, if distortions in perceptions of inequality have an ideological leaning, this could have severe consequences for how these views get translated in the political system. Taking advantage of a new survey on inequality perceptions, we are able to assess how citizens’ ideology affects their inequality evaluations across 13 Western countries. We test how ideology influences people’s ability to assess the overall level of inequality around them. In a second study, we verify the causal mechanism through an innovative survey experiment leveraging respondents’ ideological identification. The contribution of this work is double-fold: firstly, we shed new light on the phenomenon of inequality by looking at its psychological roots and secondly, we examine one of its potential explanation comparatively.

2023	332	BO74	Citizens’ Macro-Economic Perceptions: Explaining the un-Biasedness of Partisan Cheerleading	We investigate the biasing effect of partisan cheerleading on individuals’ retrospective sociotropic economic evaluations (RSEE’s). Contributing to recent debates about the nature of this effect of partisan influence, we ask when and how partisan cheerleading becomes (negative) ‘bias’ and when and how it becomes a (positive) ‘effective heuristic process’. We propose that an increasing ideological presence in government also provides control of the public narrative about the utility of particular issues as the best metric for evaluating national economic performance. When this issue narrative takes place, winners’ RSEE’s are more likely to align with the actual performance of the national economy. Using survey data from the European Elections Studies, party data from the Comparative Political Dataset, and macro-economic performance data from the World Bank, we find strong and consistent evidence for the issue narrative approach.

2023	1013	BO76	Climate conditions, public policies and attitudes towards mitigation policies. A survey experiment	To slow down the consequences of climate change, mitigation policies often require changes in people's attitudes and behaviour. Yet, while diffuse support for mitigation policies tends to be high, specific support for certain policies may bring about a tension between what the policy requires (a new tax, strict regulations, prohibitions, etc) and a change in people's attitudes and behaviour. This paper explores the trade-off between different aspects of climate mitigation policies by confronting individuals with several scenarios and their consequences. We examine this question with a conjoint experiment, as well as several vignette experiments, embedded in a survey conducted at the end of 2022. The survey was conducted in Spain and is representative of different areas of the Spanish territory, with varying degrees of climate change incidence and, therefore, with potential effects on the individual's understanding of the trade-off between climate policies and people's attitudes and behaviour. Our article has important implications for our understanding of the conditions under which climate change policies can be successfully implemented.	NA
2023	1488	BO76	Environmental shocks and migration among climate-vulnerable populations in Bangladesh	Various studies predict large environmental migration flows due to climate change, yet the ex post empirical evidence for such migration is inconclusive. I examine the causal link between environmental changes and migration drawing on the theoretical framework of the need, desire, and ability to move of affected populations. The analysis relies on original survey panel data of 1700 households residing along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, an area heavily affected by environmental changes, in particular floods and riverbank erosion. Controlling for individual level characteristics such as gender, age, risk attitudes, and migrant networks, I relate respondents’ perception of riverbank erosion and floods (need), migration aspirations (desire) and education/occupation/wealth (ability) to their likelihood to move away from their place of origin. I find that erosion significantly increases the propensity to migrate, while flooding has a significant effect only if it leads to severe and irreversible impacts. These findings have significant policy implications by underlining the nuanced relationship between different types of environmental shocks and migration, which should be reflected in policies aiming at supporting populations-at-climate risk.

2023	1847	BO76	What Humans Think About Protecting the Environment	For decades, researchers have examined public opinion about environmental issues across individuals, countries, and over time. In fact, as climate change has become one of the most pressing issues in the world, the need to understand what and how people think about protecting the environment has only increased in recent years. We highlight the potential limits of existing approaches for understanding opinion dynamics in a globalised world, especially with regard to policy challenges that cross borders with ease or require transnational and international interaction and cooperation. To examine what (all) people think about the protection of the human habitat on a global scale, our study builds on the novel approach developed by Anderson, Bol, & Ananda (2021) who start with the world as the unit of analysis and all humans as the relevant population to develop measures of global public opinion in the presence of missing or incomplete data. Applying machine learning methods to data from the World Values Surveys, we measure and predict preferences for environmental protection among all humans since 1990.	NA
2023	971	BO76	Floods of change? Extreme weather, political orientation and climate attitudes in Norway	As the concrete threats posed by climate change proliferate around the globe, understanding the impact of extreme weather events on environmental attitudes becomes increasingly important. Research has identified that left-wing (compared to right-wing) individuals are more likely to attribute extreme weather events to climate change and alter environmental attitudes after experiencing them, but questions remain about the causes of these ideological divides. Using longitudinal data from the Norwegian Citizen Panel (2018 – 2019), this paper tests the proposition that differences in need for cognition (the desire to undertake complex thinking) explain the existence of ideological divides in extreme weather response. Specifically, I employ person-level fixed effects to assess within-individual variation in climate change attitudes before and after flood exposure, and how the attitudinal impact of flood exposure is moderated by ideology and need for cognition, controlling for stable individual characteristics. In doing so, this paper represents a novel assessment of the role of need for cognition in shaping climate attitudes and responses to extreme weather and can provide new insight into the relationship between ideology and climate change.

2023	1497	IR16	Blaming it on NATO? Framing the Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Twitter	This study examines how the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and NATO's involvement in the invasion are portrayed in English-, Russian-, and German-language Twitter communities. We use computational and quantitative methods to analyze tweets from February to May 2022. Results show that the role of NATO in the war is framed differently across the three language communities, with English-speaking tweeters being more likely to hold NATO responsible for finding a solution and least likely to blame NATO for the war. Additionally, the Russian-speaking Twitter community is less likely to blame NATO for the war than the German-speaking community and is the least likely of all three communities to expect NATO to provide a solution for ending the war. This study contributes to the understanding of how social media conversations can promote political agendas in times of war, serving as a vehicle for framing, and provides further insight into the framing of war and conflict literature.

2023	1671	IR16	Chilling Effects and Curtailments of the Public Sphere: The Importance of Global Media Platforms for Studying Digital Transnational Repression	This paper argues that research on digital transnational repression has predominantly investigated covert strategies, with an emphasis on states’ use of domestic technologies to subjugate diaspora regime critics who play a crucial role in the politics of their home countries. With this focus on domestic channels of communication, relevant research has overlooked the strategic use of global media platforms for openly attacking prominent regime critics. Accordingly, I develop an analytical framework for studying digital transnational repression in the public sphere. Combining theoretical perspectives from the relevant scholarship on digital repression and foreign influence operations, I outline (1) how state-aligned media attacks can vary based on who is targeted, (2) the extent of plausible deniability in state attribution, and (3) whether media attacks are temporally aligned with other instances of state repression. I highlight how these sources of variation manifest in the transnational information environment and outline how researchers can leverage social media data to understand these dynamics. Overall, this paper contributes a novel conceptual and empirical basis for studying the strategic repertoires of digital transnational repression on global media platforms.	NA
2023	526	IR16	Does online speech predict communal violence? Evidence from India	Does promotion of violence on social media cause violence in the real world? While several high-profile examples for this mechanism exist, systematic research suggests that this effect varies across domains of political violence. For communal violence and riots, no systematic connection has been demonstrated yet. Informing this debate, we are legally downloading the complete kooapp.com social media network from India, and currently stand at four million user records with an associated 23 million posts and comments. Additionally, we rely on reports of 1,200 violent attacks on religious minorities in the country, for the 2020-2022 period. We combine case-informed searches of incendiary keywords with word embedding models to calculate network-level fractions of dangerous speech. This indicator seems predictive of real-world attacks in preliminary data analysis for both Hindi-speaking northern states and the Kannada language home to the state of Karnataka.	NA
2023	950	IR16	The impact of online dangerous speech on prejudice in India	Social media has facilitated the spread of hostile, misleading, and prejudiced speech to mainstream audiences. Online speech may be a steppingstone to offline hostilities if it increases prejudice towards certain groups. It is therefore vital to understand how such online dangerous speech affects the people who encounter it. Through a survey experiment, we study the impact of online dangerous speech on prejudice among respondents in India. We expect exposure to dangerous speech appearing in social media posts to trigger prejudice, even when the speech itself seems unalarming. Respondents with high levels of social media literacy and much experience with intergroup contact are expected to be less receptive to online dangerous speech. Moreover, likes and shares, which can be signs of public endorsement, might strengthen the effect of such speech. India is an ideal case study because the country is currently and historically embroiled in tensions between religious groups, with hostilities propagated widely on social media. The paper contributes to the literatures on prejudice-creation, social media ramifications, and conflict dynamics by connecting speech and prejudice.	NA
2023	1052	1052	Local Realities Matter: The Contrasting Impact of Embedded Bureaucrats on Learning in Public Schools across Rural India	Local bureaucrats, i.e., bureaucrats serving in the same locality in which they grew up, enjoy an information advantage and have more local links they can use to promote the public good. The same connections that allow them to get things done, however, also pose a risk of being captured by or colluding with powerful groups to advance private interests, thereby undermining the public good. This paper shows empirically that the local environment shapes whether public service provision is improved or harmed by a higher share of local bureaucrats. Exploiting a plausibly random assignment mechanism of members of the elite Indian Administrative Service to districts across rural India, it demonstrates that learning in (public) government schools is harmed by a higher share of local bureaucrats in low-literacy districts while it is improved in high-literacy districts. This implies that a uniform posting policy for bureaucrats across a diverse country might have contrasting effects on public goods provision, especially if the public good has (re-)distributive implications, and might reinforce divergence in the quality of public goods provided to citizens.

2023	1669	CP08	Control or Collusion? Regional Shared-Rule and Corruption in Presidential and Parliamentary Systems	Previous research found that regional shared rule reduces national level corruption. Yet, political institutions do not function in isolation, but they are usually part of a wider institutional package (as Lijphard already pointed out many years ago). Regional shared rule is no exception. We suggest that the effect of regional shared rule on political corruption is conditional on a country’s form of government. Presidentialism requires deal-making and impedes accountability. We argue that under these conditions regional representatives serve as access points for private interests and rent-seeking. In contrast, parliamentarism does not provide favorable conditions for corruption. In countries with a parliamentary system, shared rule contributes to controlling the government. This deters corrupt interactions. The results from a time-series cross-sectional analysis (56-95 countries, 1950-2018, RAI index, Vdem, ICRG, CPI and WGI data) support our expectations: shared rule stimulates corruption in countries with a presidential system but contributes to controlling corruption in countries with a parliamentary system.

2023	381	381	Delegation Problems in Critical Government Data: Evidence from the American Death Registry	High-quality data on residents and their needs is necessary for effective governance, yet, obtaining these data across broadly diverse areas can be challenging and costly. As such, government officials frequently delegate to local agencies and officials to collect the raw data that is used to shape and evaluate state and federal policy. We argue that this delegation, while operationally necessary, is likely to produce data of dubious quality given substantial variation in local resource endowments. As a result, the information obtained for some areas is likely to be more accurate than others. In an analysis of the United States’ death registry, we show that this is true even in non-controversial data collection, as more populace counties produce more specific and detailed information on resident deaths. For scientists, this is a cautionary tale on the quality of official data. Normatively, this heterogeneity in data quality implies that the needs of some residents are better accounted for and addressed than others.	NA

2023	1363	BO08	Should I Use Factorial or Conjoint Experiments to Evaluate Policy Designs? A comparison of support estimates, respondent burden and understanding	Environmental, transport and social public policies are often quite complex – incorporating multiple instruments and regulations. Yet, public support varies substantially by instrument. Accordingly, recent empirical research has focused how policy designs (policy packages including diverse instruments) shape policy support (e.g. carbon taxation, mobility pricing), commonly adopting survey-embedded experimental designs, such as conjoint and factorial experiments. Yet, little remains known about potential differences between adopting conjoint and factorial experimental approaches to evaluate policy designs. Here, we adopt a novel methodological survey-embedded experiment to compare how policy preferences differ by factorial and conjoint designs. Further, we explore perceptions of comprehension and burden associated with experimental design choices. We find similar patterns of policy instrument support across three experimental designs conditions, while noting that conjoint experimental designs were perceived to be more burdensome and somewhat more difficult to understand. Thus, we formulate a set of recommendations, whereby factorial experimental designs are suggested for policy research focusing on specific instruments (levels). While conjoint designs are suggested for research towards identifying policy packages (combinations of levels) and sub-group differences, leveraging increased power within such experiments.	NA
2023	356	BO08	What counts for citizens’ programmatic choices? A conjoint experiment on ideology, policy trade-offs and group representation	Electoral programs aggregate policy proposals targeting diversified social groups. How do voters trade-off between these targeted policy proposals in their prospective evaluation of manifestos? We develop and test three hypotheses, i.e. whether citizens judge programs primarily in view of the proposals targeting the groups (1) they belong to, (2) that are majoritarily perceived as deserving or (3) through the lens of ideological representations of groups.We designed a conjoint experiment in which respondents had to choose between hypothetical sets of party manifestos addressing different social groups. The presented manifestos are based on real-world electoral pledges taken from the German 2021 legislative and the French 2022 presidential electoral campaign. Our analyses reveal that voters’ program choice varies depending on which groups are targeted in a beneficial or detrimental way, reflecting for instance the finding that senior citizens are largely perceived as “deserving” while immigrants are not (2). However, our study also reveals considerable heterogeneity in program choice, less in terms of respondents’ group membership (1) than depending on ideology (3).	NA
2023	561	BO08	Something for Nothing in Scandinavia? Do Economic Risks Boost Redistribution Demand but Undermine Taxation Support?	Classical political economy models suggest that citizens facing economic adversity demand state redistribution. Recent single-country studies additionally suggest adversity may also reduce willingness to pay taxes (Jacques and Weisstanner 2022). It may lead to a “something for nothing” phenomenon, whereby citizens will not pay for the additional spending they demand (Edlund and Johansen Seva 2013). We test if this tendency is cushioned by satisfaction with existing public services. Moreover, we study a hard case, Norway, where support for taxes and spending are ideologically structured. Finding that Norwegians become pro-spending, but anti-tax when facing economic hardship would go against the consensus in the literature on public opinion in Nordic welfare states. Our empirical analysis uses three waves of a panel survey conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2017 allowing us to leverage variation between and within individual respondents. We study the impact of an index of perceived economic risks and an original measure of income growth on preferences for redistribution and willingness to pay taxes, along with the conditional effect of the satisfaction with public services.

2023	599	BO08	There is no alternative? How voters perceive democratic choices over economic policies	Globalization and Europeanization have restricted national autonomy over economic policies in advanced democracies and led to an increased convergence of party positions on economic issues. As a result, democracies face a responsiveness dilemma where economic choices are increasingly out of the reach of voters. Do citizens feel that they face more and more meaningless elections that do not lead to changes in economic policy? In this paper, we use novel data from a representative online survey fielded in Portugal, Spain and Germany that measures, for the first time, economic choice perceptions on the individual level. Economic choice is defined as (1) the variety of economic policy alternatives proposed by political actors (economic policy offer); and (2) the degree to which political actors are able and willing to fulfil their electoral promises once in government (economic mandate fulfilment). We aim to establish whether voters perceive their economic policy choice as limited; whether they are aware of the economic constraints that their governments face; and if a perceived lack of economic choice negatively affects support for democracy.

2023	958	EU05	Eurosceptic dominance or pro-European backlash? The electoral salience of the European integration issue in national, multidimensional policy spaces	The last decade has been characterized by rising Euroscepticism. However, we know little about how this has affected voters holding pro-European attitudes. I argue that due to multiple Europe related crises and ongoing Eurosceptic politicization, de-politicizing European issues is no longer a promising strategy for pro-European parties. Thus, pro-European parties start politicizing in a pro-European manner. By this, they mobilize pro-European attitudes which is reflected in increasing salience of the European integration issue among pro-European voters. To test this argument, I derive salience estimates directly from spatial vote models encompassing five issue dimensions. I use data from the European Social Survey, the European Election Study, and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey encompassing a wide range of EU member states between 2008 and 2019. Overall, the results point to a punctuated politicization since there is country- and time-specific variation. The salience of the European integration issue is still more pronounced among Eurosceptic voters. However, in highly politicized environments, such as the Brexit referendum, the pro-European side benefits as evidenced by converging salience levels between Eurosceptic and pro-European voters.	NA
