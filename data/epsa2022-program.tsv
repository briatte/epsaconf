However, the use of dehumanizing rhetoric by pro-immigration political actors, how this might differ from anti-immigration rhetoric, and the consequences of these differences, has been largely unresearched. As immigration is a highly polarized topic, it is important to dive into how rhetoric on both sides may have contributed to the moral divide. This paper will focus specifically on signaling moral agency (or the lack thereof) of immigrants, such as the implied capacity of carrying out (im)moral acts or attributing responsibility and blame. It will analyze how perceived agency can be lowered or heightened through dehumanizing metaphors, how the two sides differ in this, and the implications of this on moral judgements of immigrants and immigration. Case studies such as the question of returning female jihadist will be used to analyze how dehumanizing rhetoric can signal (lack of) agency. Text analysis with a focus on critical metaphor analysis will be applied to speeches, debates, and manuscripts by mainstream and extremist, pro-immigration and anti-immigration political actors, across multiple Northern European countries. This research will provide a unique view on the contribution of pro-immigration discourse on the dehumanization of immigrants through the role of moral agency and carries implications on how this might affect moral polarization surrounding the topic of immigration.

Most existing cross-national studies of party competition related to immigration examine the varying salience of the topic and the positions that different parties take. We argue, however, that to understand the political dynamics around the topic, a key dimension is missing: attention to rhetorical style. We zoom in on politicians’ moral rhetoric – that is, the extent to which they use language that portrays immigration as a matter of fundamental values; of right and wrong. Using a newly developed and validated moral dictionary in different languages, we examine how moral rhetoric on immigration varies across time, space, and political parties in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. Given the implications for political debate and polarization associated with moralizing rhetoric, our study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the potency and divisiveness associated with immigration discourse. In addition, focusing on moralization as a rhetorical style, our paper offers a new take on party competition with potential implications for understanding political debate and agenda-setting more generally.

Examining the Party Competition between Mainstream Parties and the Radical Right on Immigration	279	The party competition on immigration and multiculturalism has recently come into focus of research on the radical right’s electoral performance. Scholarship illustrates that the strategic behaviour of mainstream parties (MP), especially the centre-right, influences the election results of the radical right (RR). My paper complements respective studies by analysing the strategy that MP adopt. The principal choice of MP between an accommodative, dismissive, or adversarial strategy is considered in the context of the RR’s policy stance. Examining the positional distance vis-à-vis the RR, my paper addresses the question “Which factors influence the strategic positioning of mainstream parties on immigration?” An investigation of the competing policy proposals is worthwhile, as the extent of topical convergence is linked to electoral performance and changes of immigration laws. Employing multilevel analyses, the positional distance between MP and the RR is the dependent variable. Independent variables include party characteristics such as electoral results, ideological orientation, and incumbent status as well as country specific factors. Relying on the Immigration in Party Manifestos (IPM) dataset, the analyses cover 11 West European countries from 1985 to 2015. Due to IPM’s profound coverage of the immigration stance, the dataset allows to examine party competition on prominent sub-areas like immigration control. Preliminary results indicate that MP are not oriented towards the RR alone. Instead, MP also consider the positioning vis-à-vis their main competitor. Moreover, the analyses highlight the necessity to pay increasing attention to the sub-areas of immigration.	Political Communication

In this paper, we study this view in the context of the politicization of rent and housing policy during two election campaigns and one legislative period in Germany -- a country with pronounced geographic heterogeneity in housing markets and a mixed-member PR system in which most MPs compete for personal votes in electoral districts. We use monthly time-series cross-sectional data based on original salience estimates from a binary classification of housing-related statements in MPs' tweets along with aggregations of rent prices at the level of electoral districts from millions of georeferenced housing ads to study the nexus between MPs’ attention to housing policy and local rental markets across time and space. Next to the baseline hypothesis that high prices of rental objects incentivize MPs' attention on housing policy, we test several important scope conditions. Specifically, we hypothesize that the effect will be more pronounced in districts where constituents share widespread grievances over a saturated rental market (i.e., low ownership rates and low intra-district heterogeneity in local rents), among left-wing MPs who are more likely to benefit electorally from the politicization of surging rental costs, and during election campaigns when MPs are most dependent on the approval of their local constituents.

However, many electoral contests are between relatively little-known candidates. Chances are, many voters have not heard of the names of the district's candidates before they enter the voting booth. We argue that even in these cases, voters can use regionally typical surnames of candidates as a signal that candidates share certain characteristics and preferences with local voters. The argument implies that voters do not have to connect a candidate's name to the person but only identify the candidate as ""one-of-us"" from their surname. In other words, candidates whose last name indicates that they originate from the region will be perceived as more trustworthy representatives of local interests and therefore rewarded. Using an onomastic database, we code whether constituency candidates in the German federal elections 2005--2021 have a typical regional name. We are able to show that regional names indeed provide candidates with an electoral bonus.	Parties and Representation

Personal vote-seeking and local responsiveness, however, are attributed to open-list or plurality systems. In this paper, I argue that the focus on inter-party competition misses the potential for personal vote-seeking and local responsiveness emanating from incentives of intra-party competition for renomination. Specifically, it's parties' candidate selection methods that rely on locally-minded delegates that introduce the incentive for incumbents to engage in local responsiveness. Using an original and novel data-set based on (historical) nomination protocols of the German Green party, survey experiments with delegates and geo-referenced legislative behavior, I can show that locally responsive incumbents are rewarded with better ranks and higher margins, that this is mainly limited to men who face greater competition and that delegates indeed prefer locally-minded incumbents. My findings shed new light on the interplay of electoral and selectoral incentives for behavior.	Parties and Representation

Although primary elections are expected to limit party elites’ ability to decide who gets to run under the party’s ticket, the question of party elite influence in primary elections has received little empirical attention. This paper advances an argument linking primary outcomes to the strategic behavior of subnational party elites, particularly those who control key resources to mobilize the primary electorate in favor of their preferred aspirants. I provide support for this argument using data on legislative candidate selection in Mexico. The results indicate that a party’s legislative primaries (1) have greater turnout and (2) are decided by considerably larger margins in states where that party controls the governorship. Importantly, I show these patterns are driven by governors who have more time left in office, and thus have greater incentive to invest resources in primary races. These results have important implications for the study of legislative politics in Mexico. While it is widely assumed that governors’ influence the behavior of national legislators through their control over ballot access, this paper presents empirical evidence showing that governors indeed shape their parties’ nomination processes and identifies some of the channels by which they do so.

While these studies focus mostly on contemporary variables, a growing multidisciplinary literature has shown that early adult life experiences shape contemporary individual political preferences. In this paper, I advance and empirically test the hypothesis that exposure to unsuccessful austerity during one’s early adult life negatively influences people’s support for consolidation later in life. Austerity represents a retrenchment of citizens’ entitlements and a deterioration of their economic standing. Citizens respond to these changes by updating their preferences. Moreover, previous exposure to austerity can shape preferences because of its impact on people’s trust in the effectiveness of austerity. Among those who have already suffered from austerity, when asked again to bear its costs, there will be a widespread lack of trust in austerity’s promise to generate future rewards, e.g., avoid future deeper consolidation, and thus lower support for austerity. To test the theory, I employ an IMF database of episodes of fiscal retrenchment and data on people’s living history and current attitudes towards fiscal consolidation from Eurobarometer surveys and an original survey carried out in Italy. The findings suggest austerity has a long-lived impact on individual preferences that can help explain contemporary variation in support for debt consolidation among citizens. Mediation analysis reveals that the effect is partially caused by lowered trust in austerity.	Political Economy

We examine this question via the large COVID-19 shock that began in Spring 2020, causing one of the largest acute economic contractions in recent history. While evidence that recessions meaningfully change fiscal preferences is limited, we hypothesize that the health pandemic should have distinct effects, due to the large breadth, uncertainty, and socio-tropic basis of the economic contraction. We hypothesize that sharp aggregate reductions in personal income economic evaluations and optimism should positively affect fiscal support. We use new panel evidence from the hard-hit Spain, surveying individuals prior to the pandemic in August 2019 and the same individuals during the pandemic in May 2020. We find that individuals became more economically pessimistic across many measures, but this did not translate into support for more expansive fiscal policies. A framing experiment indicates that this could be due to aversion to assist lower-income individuals.	Political Economy

Yet, states vary tremendously in their ability to enforce tax policies and collect taxes from its citizens. Moreover, it is unlikely that citizens are ignorant of and indifferent to the state's capacity to enforce tax laws.In this paper, we ask how changes in taxpayers’ perceptions of the state’s fiscal capacity change preferences over taxation. Does lower tax capacity reduce overall demand for taxation and voters’ willingness to pay tax? Moreover, do (poor) voters’ preferences over taxes on the rich change if they think that the rich can easily evade taxes? Similarly, voters might be less willing to pay tax in response to evasion by the rich for two different reasons: 1) perceived efficiency and revenue losses; or 2) increased unfairness of taxation.The influence of state capacity on citizen perceptions of distribution and, consequently their preferences and behavior has received limited attention in political science and economics. To address this gap in our understanding, we undertake a survey experiment in which we encourage different perceptions of the state’s fiscal capacity. Subjects are given true information treatments about the state’s ability to enforce tax policies and evasion across income groups, priming either fairness or revenue losses. We investigate the effects on respondents’ preferences over tax rates, taxes on the rich, and their own willingness to pay tax.	Political Economy

As opposing groups attempt to wait each other out, debt burdens and the cost of stabilization grow. Despite a prominent theoretical basis, there is little empirical evidence of this strategic delay. Here, we test the implications of this theory for ethnic politics through an original survey experiment fielded in Kenya with 2000 respondents. Notably, we investigate how variation in perceptions of victory for co-ethnic politicians influences support for adopting reforms before or after the 2022 general election. We then plan to run a follow-up survey after the election to examine if preferences change in light of the electoral results.

Here, we test the implications of this theory for ethnic politics through an original survey experiment fielded in Kenya with 2000 respondents. Notably, we investigate how variation in perceptions of victory for co-ethnic politicians influences support for adopting reforms before or after the 2022 general election. We then plan to run a follow-up survey after the election to examine if preferences change in light of the electoral results. When individuals expect co-ethnic candidates to win, they prefer to delay reforms until this candidate enters government, while those who expect co-ethnic candidates to lose prefer to introduce reforms immediately. This work speaks to a long-standing claim in the economic reform literature, but while most research assumes fiscal preferences fall along a left-right dimension, we show that ethnic divisions are salient in the politics of debt reduction.

Yet, states vary tremendously in their ability to enforce tax policies and collect taxes from its citizens. Moreover, it is unlikely that citizens are ignorant of and indifferent to the state's capacity to enforce tax laws.In this paper, we ask how changes in taxpayers’ perceptions of the state’s fiscal capacity change preferences over taxation. Does lower tax capacity reduce overall demand for taxation and voters’ willingness to pay tax? Moreover, do (poor) voters’ preferences over taxes on the rich change if they think that the rich can easily evade taxes? Similarly, voters might be less willing to pay tax in response to evasion by the rich for two different reasons: 1) perceived efficiency and revenue losses; or 2) increased unfairness of taxation.The influence of state capacity on citizen perceptions of distribution and, consequently their preferences and behavior has received limited attention in political science and economics. To address this gap in our understanding, we undertake a survey experiment in which we encourage different perceptions of the state’s fiscal capacity. Subjects are given true information treatments about the state’s ability to enforce tax policies and evasion across income groups, priming either fairness or revenue losses. We investigate the effects on respondents’ preferences over tax rates, taxes on the rich, and their own willingness to pay tax.	Political Economy

However, voter turnout has declined worldwide from 76% in the late 1980s to 66% in 2011 and is even lower in local elections (Solijonov 2016). Since budget transparency increases participation (Benito and Bastida 2009), understanding the effects of partisanship on local public expenditures may invigorate voter turnout.Existing literature has shown mixed evidence of partisanship effects on local budgets. Some authors emphasize the role played by political parties (Pettersson-Lidbom 2008; Gerber and Hopkins 2011; de Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw 2016), while others highlight the lack of partisanship effect on public expenditures (Ferreira and Gyourko 2009; Leigh 2008). Ferreira and Gyourko (2009) and de Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw (2016) reach contradictory results analyzing U.S. mayoral elections using different lower bounds on city size. If the impact of political parties differs by city size, heterogeneity may explain the conflicting results shown in the literature.In this paper, I investigate the heterogeneous influence of city size to clarify its effects on partisanship. First, I analyze the impact of political parties on public expenditures on French municipalities with a regression discontinuity design. I find strong effects of partisanship; left-wing mayors invest 65 euros more per capita than their right-wing counterparts. Second, I estimate partisanship effects on two clusters of municipalities built with a K-means algorithm. I find similar partisanship effects on capital outlays in small and large municipalities and impacts on current expenditures only in small cities.	Political Economy

State sponsored technological extension has been recently associated with higher state capacity. However, there's limited evidence on the determinants of the expansion of technological adoption when the state is the main driver of it. The telegraph contributed to the immediate communication between state officials, without them having to physically move to communicate. Seen from this perspective in which the telegraph is part of the infrastructural power of the State, how can its uneven development be explained? Why policymakers decided to place telegraph stations in some places and not in others? I explore this question using newly digitized data from Sweden in 1865. The first hypothesis is that the preferences of the economic elites increased the likelihood of adopting the telegraph. The second hypothesis is that the emergence of labour movement and political unrest increased the likelihood of adopting the telegraph. To test these hypotheses, I operationalize the preferences of the burgeoise with population density for each of the 2400 swedish municipalities. To test whether labour conflict led to more telegraph, I use geocoded data on labour conflicts from 1865- 1888 in Sweden. Preliminary results show that population density had a huge effect on the likelihood of adopting the telegraph, whereas conflict didn't. This aligns with modernization theory - rather than political repression from extractive elites - as the main driver of state sponsored technology.	Political Economy

High-routine manufacturing occupations, in particular, have experienced varied employment and earnings trends across countries. In this paper, I investigate whether robotisation and labour market institutions have (heterogeneous) effects on the wage premium for manufacturing workers in a sample of 20 OECD countries between 1993 and 2016.I pursue three related arguments. The productivity argument states that the manufacturing wage premium is a function of relative labour productivity in manufacturing, which is assumed to increase with robotisation. The power resource argument posits that differential exposure to inclusive labour market institutions alters the relative bargaining power of occupational groups, with higher unionisation and stricter employment protection benefitting manufacturing workers. Since these two arguments have not yet been studied jointly, I also investigate whether institutions moderate the impact of robotisation on wages, and thus close another gap in the literature.I find evidence in favour of the productivity and institutional arguments in descriptive analyses; however, only employment protection significantly affects the manufacturing wage premium in panel regression analyses. Moreover, only employment protection, but not union density, moderates this relationship.To my knowledge, this is the first study that jointly analyses the impact of robotisation and labour market institutions on the wages of manufacturing workers relative to other occupational groups. I find a limited role for robotisation and highlight the impact of institutions on occupational wage hierarchies. This has important implications for the political economy of labour market regulation.	Political Economy

In the classic theoretical framework, first formulated by Arrow (1962), patents protect against free-riding and create incentives for the provision of what would otherwise be a public good. This is in stark contrast with empirical evidence, according to which inventors find secrecy more effective than patents in excluding others from inventions. This presents a paradox: patents are theorized to be indispensable for innovation, but not all inventors find them useful in protecting their inventions. One way to resolve this paradox is to strictly separate inventions that can be protected with secrecy (because they are costly to reverse-engineer) from those that cannot (because they can be easily reverse-engineered). Most existing literature focuses only on the latter and assumes that inventors patent their inventions to make them excludable (the excludability motive). This paper shows that such separation may be miss-guided. Based on a survival-analysis of analysis of 4,741,023 U.S. patents, it shows evidence of inventors patenting not for the excludability motive, but to sell or license their inventions (the alienability motive). If this is the case, it would indicate a strong role of patents in disclosing inventions that would have been kept as secrets. This has significant implications on optimal innovation and patenting policy.	Political Economy

We argue that remittances allow recipients to purchase certain 'substitutable' public services (like health and education) in the private market, which makes them less willing to pay taxes to support government spending on these services. Remittance recipients are more supportive of government provision of 'non-substitutable' public services like security and infrastructure because they find it difficult to purchase these on the private market using the remittances they receive. To pay for these public services, remittance recipients prefer to raise income taxes (which they do not pay on remittances income) than consumption taxes. Using experimental evidence from Mexico, we investigate whether those receiving remittances are distinct from other individuals in their willingness to pay more taxes under a hypothetical increase in spending on a particular type of public good, and their preferences for reallocating resources between different public good areas under a budget constraint. We provide evidence for our argument, demonstrating that remittances are an important driver of fiscal policy attitudes.	Behaviour and Opinion

Can other citizens compensate for this, by increasing their efforts to protect vulnerable groups? Using close municipal elections in Italy, I estimate the causal effect of far-right administrations on the creation of local volunteering associations. Over a mayoral term, far-right governance leads to the creation of one additional association per 20,000 inhabitants. This result is entirely explained by associations providing social welfare, while no impact is detected on other types of associations. Using individual-level survey data, I document how such an increase is likely to be driven by citizens with positive attitudes towards migrants, who engage more in volunteering activities during far-right mayoral spells. These findings complement our understanding of the consequences of far-right success, demonstrating its potential to trigger positive behaviors that may attenuate the detrimental effects of far-right governance in equilibrium.

Authoritarian attitudes have been linked to outcomes such as the contemporary emergence of populism and democratic backsliding in many countries. Yet, it remains poorly understand why the prevalence of such attitudes varies between individuals, societies, and over time. This paper revisits the hypothesis that exposure to existential insecurity - emerging from physical or economic threats - promote authoritarian attitudes. It explores this in a global analysis linking spatial survey data capturing authoritarian attitudes to precise information on the location and timing of natural disasters, offering exogenous sources of variation in physical and economic treats between individuals. Combining different empirical approaches, including cohort-analysis and a differences-in-differences approach, we explore whether exposure to natural disasters explain authoritarian attitudes. We further investigate whether disaster exposure during the formative years of childhood and adolescence matters more than these same experiences in adulthood. Finally, using data on second generation immigrants, we explore whether any effects of natural disasters on authoritarian attitudes persist across generations.	Comparative Politics

Contrary to theoretical expectations, these mental models of the economy vary considerably (Barnes et al forthcoming) and can be explored systematically.Using advances from computational linguistics in argument mining and text summarisation, we propose an automated framework for identifying and linking ideas about the economy expressed by politicians, the media and the public in multi-lingual and multi-media corpora consisting of elite interviews, surveys and newspapers from five countries.To identify and structure ideas of the economy in text corpora, we adapt the parse-and-reduce approach of Ash et al (2021). Subject-verb-object (SVO) triples are extracted from the text using dependency parsers, then the space of SVO tokens is reduced using labelled WordNet associations and unsupervised word embedding clustering. Finally, we use semi-supervised label propagation and topic modelling methods to classify and cluster triples.The main challenge results from our expectation that we do not expect to find identical clusters of ideas between politicians, the public and the media. Our key methodological contribution is a method for identifying and linking related ideas and narratives in disparate media and corpora. This is possible with descriptively intuitive and rich SVO triples, which allow for qualitative discursive comparison of the idea clusters. This tool has wider application for the empirical measurement of ideational flows.	Political Methodology

Contrary to theoretical expectations, these mental models of the economy vary considerably (Barnes et al forthcoming) and can be explored systematically.Using advances from computational linguistics in argument mining and text summarisation, we propose an automated framework for identifying and linking ideas about the economy expressed by politicians, the media and the public in multi-lingual and multi-media corpora consisting of elite interviews, surveys and newspapers from five countries.To identify and structure ideas of the economy in text corpora, we adapt the parse-and-reduce approach of Ash et al (2021). Subject-verb-object (SVO) triples are extracted from the text using dependency parsers, then the space of SVO tokens is reduced using labelled WordNet associations and unsupervised word embedding clustering. Finally, we use semi-supervised label propagation and topic modelling methods to classify and cluster triples.The main challenge results from our expectation that we do not expect to find identical clusters of ideas between politicians, the public and the media. Our key methodological contribution is a method for identifying and linking related ideas and narratives in disparate media and corpora. This is possible with descriptively intuitive and rich SVO triples, which allow for qualitative discursive comparison of the idea clusters. This tool has wider application for the empirical measurement of ideational flows.	Political Methodology

Less is understood about whether political elites are similarly affectively polarized and the consequences this carries for elite behavior and representation. In this paper, I propose a novel measure of elite partisan messaging and affective polarization which I call the Index of Messaging and Affective Polarization (IMAP). IMAP captures both the prominence and direction of sentiment toward the two major parties in tweets posted by elected officials. After describing the measure, I demonstrate its face validity using prominent national political figures to show that the measure comports with their reputations as extreme partisans. Next, I illustrate how IMAP relates to a variety of behavioral outcomes, including congressional bill co-sponsorship decisions, appearances in the partisan media, and public responses to partisan scandals. I then show that the validity of IMAP extends to state governors. Finally, I conclude by considering potential avenues for future research employing IMAP.	Political Methodology

The FBiH is further divided into ten autonomous cantons, four of which have a Croat majority and six of which have a Bosniak majority. The current crisis in BiH is asymmetric as well. It affects the disputes between the two entities (RS and FBiH), and within the FBiH, between Bosniaks and Croats over the electoral legislation. While Bosniak leaders promote strong centripetalism and majoritarian solutions, the Croat leadership asks for more autonomy and strong consociational features. The paper explores the application of a cross-ethnic voting mechanism defined as the ""geographic distribution requirements"". This centripetal mechanism prescribes that the winning candidate must obtain the majority of votes and achieve pre-determined territorial thresholds, without considering the ethnic affiliation of the candidates. The geographic distribution requirements guarantee cross-regional and cross-ethnic support, but at the same time could be designed to include both consociational and centripetal features. This electoral system could be explored as an innovative electoral power-sharing mechanism to accommodate Bosniak majority and Croat minority groups within the FBiH, including for the election of the Croat member for the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several models will be proposed for deblocking one of the major political crises in Europe ahead of 2022 BiH’s general elections.	Political Institutions

This paper investigates the interconnected web of alliances and rivalries between armed groups in the ongoing Yemen Civil War to address the following question: why do armed groups fight each other? This paper adopts an inferential network approach to investigate determinants of intergroup conflict. In particular, it emphasises the role of group identity, arguing that operating in salient cleavages necessitates that groups align with or distinguish themselves from each other. We hypothesize that shared identity increases the likelihood of conflict in dyads, while moderate similarities do not exert this degree of influence. Additionally, we argue that informal alliances between groups counterintuitively incentivises violence the longer the war continues. These arguments are tested using exponential random graph models to account for endogenous structures arising from repeated interactions over time and explore the causal pathway between identity, alliances and fratricide. Our findings indicate that shared identity is a significant driver of hostilities, moderates the influence of cooperation and amplifies the effects of group attributes. We find no support for the traditional proposition that power asymmetry significantly affects group rivalry. Using a variety of robustness measures and simulation, it is also shown that network models more accurately capture the underlying data-generating process to predict fighting between groups in this case.

We track the shifts in the level of authority expansion from the proposal to the final act, and examine whether the conflict of preferences within and across the EU institutions drives the outcome of negotiations towards the SQ. We posit that a politicized environment coupled with the waning support for the EU involvement shape the motivations of the Council and the EP to adjust the pace of EU authority expansion to the public preferences. However, the EU legislators may respond to different groups within the Union’s population and face different time-horizons. Discrepancies between country-level support for the EU action across the member states define the extent of the inter- and intra-institutional conflicts within the Union. To avoid gridlock and legislative failure, the EU legislators will coin an outcome limiting the expansion of the EU authority. To test our argument, we identify the difference in the extent of authority transfer embedded into the text of legislative proposals and the adopted legislative acts using text analysis techniques. We draw on the Eurobarometer indicators to capture the variation in the level of support for the EU action across policy areas.

Using surveys fielded in 2016 and 2017, this paper is the first to maintain the diversity of EU citizens (in terms of birth country, time in the UK, UK region, age, gender, education, and employment) to explore how EU citizens' articulations and experiences of Brexit differ, in particular, vis-a-vis the transformation of rights and citizenship. The paper focuses on the leverage of topic modeling for analyzing the content and meaning of open-ended survey responses (n = 3,512). Assembling twelve topics, first, the paper finds that those from 'old' EU member-states (e.g. France, Germany) were more concerned about career and family prospects compared to those from southern (Italy, Spain) and 'newer' EU member-states (Romania, Poland) who were more concerned by xenophobia provoked by Brexit. Thus, the paper suggests those experiencing xenophobia as a consequence of Brexit is both specific but wider than expected, encompassing those who are recognized as recipients of discrimination in the UK and those who are not. Second, the paper finds that gender and age were also significant covariates: women were particularly concerned about citizenship rights and exclusion compared to men, and younger participants were more concerned by career, family prospects, and xenophobia. Overall, the paper suggests that the negative effects and experiences of Brexit need to be conceptualized through unexpected lenses like gender, as well as country of origin.	European Politics

Analysing 20 years of EU Member States preferences with topic modeling	256	In the context of the past political, social, and most recent economic developments, energy policy is the topic with the highest priority in the EU. Besides, being one of the most critical political issues today, energy policy is also inherently tied to climate change. However, do EU Member States (MS) really prefer climate change as it might appear? What about other closely related yet often competing policy priorities of the energy security, or the Energy Union, the project launched in 2015? My scholarly caution has been raised about climate policy goals of the EU and their feasibility with other priorities, which aims at building a secure, competitive, and affordable energy market. I investigated the policy preferences of the EU MS, performing a topic modeling analysis of more than twenty years of plenary debates in the European Parliament (EP). For this extensive data inquiry, I took advantage of an unprecedentedly large dataset of more than two hundred thousand of MEP's contributions during plenary debates addressing energy issues. As my research (which is also part of my dissertation project) is a work in progress, I cannot highlight any particular outcome yet. However, I intend to cast light on underlying features of text reflecting two decades of energy policy debates in the EP and encode its structure into an estimation of categories (topics). This unsupervised learning method enables me to identify organisation of energy policy debate which I would like to present at the conference in Prague.	European Politics

As Romania faced widespread Covid-19 vaccination scepticism, the president appealed to church officials for their support, but they refused. The president’s attempt to create a culturally resonant message for Romanian citizens to vaccinate remained unmet. While the concept of cultural resonance is supposed to explain why audiences adopt certain frames more easily, we lack a systematic understanding of what constitutes cultural resonance, as well as how we can measure its effects in public discourse. This study furthers our understanding of resonance processes in political communication and contributes to framing effects research. To our knowledge, it constitutes the first attempt to study the causal relationship between exposure to culturally congruent frames and resonance outcomes. Furthermore, we investigate whether culturally congruent frames are resonant only when heuristic processing occurs (compared to systematic) and whether having counterarguments present cancels their effect. Lastly, we develop survey measures for resonance outcomes (i.e., issue interpretations that range from unchallenged acceptance of arguments to outright rejection). We conduct an online survey experiment (N=2700) in three national contexts: Romania, Germany, and the UK. The countries were chosen to vary significantly on the individualism vs collectivism national cultural dimension. The more individualist the context, the more should the guilt eliciting policy resonate (UK=89/100). Conversely, the more collectivist the context, the more should the shame policy resonate (Romania=30/100). Germany leans towards individualism (67/100).	Political Communication

Although language and text should be secondary to images from a behavioral perspective, until recently scholarly attention was almost exclusively focused on textual analysis. In fact, when we scroll through social media newsfeeds or read a newspaper, images grab our attention first and influence our opinions well before we get to the text itself. Hence, images are meant to prime our evaluations, but do they? How does nontextual information contribute to media bias? What is the mechanism through which nontextual frames promote or mitigate affective political divide? In order to answer these questions, we select a shortlist of political events and track the manner in which ideologically diverse media reported such events on social media. We unsupervised computer vision algorithms to analyze images accompanying these news stories. After, we analyze news short descriptions to identify differences in the sentiment between liberal and conservative media outlets towards the same events. Finally, we conduct a series of online survey experiments in order to identify the exact mechanisms through which images introduce bias and increase the affective divide. Since visual information is more credible than text, we hypothesize that media outlets will attach more sentiment to images accompanying news stories than to the stories themselves. Our starting point for empirical evidence is the US, but we expect that the revealed behavioral mechanisms will be easily generalized to other political environments.	Political Communication

Linking Incivility, Intolerance and Preferences for Content Moderation Online	1146	Incivility is becoming highly relevant in online political communication on social media, and existing scholarship has emphasized the importance of identifying uncivil content and its downstream consequences. At the same time, scholars agree that incivility is a challenging concept to define as, among other things, it is context-dependent. As a result, operationalizations vary widely in the literature, ranging from measurements of the concept as a continuous scale to its decomposition into different dimensions and its decoupling from concepts like intolerance. While this research is growing, we still have insufficient understanding as to whether, for example, intolerance, incivility, and other forms of toxic and threatening behaviour are separate dimensions of undesirable behavior. While past work has shown that incivility and intolerance can occur in different contexts, when it comes to the consequences for individuals, is intolerance an analytically distinct concept from incivility and when exactly do citizens perceive comments as “crossing a line”? We propose a new theoretical framework covering the dimensions incivility, intolerance, and threat to explain the effects of incivility on emotional state, activation, and preferences for moderation. Using an original online experiment, we attempt to uncover the consequences of uncivil online discussions. We build on recent theoretical developments on incivility and expose participants to political social media posts varying in the level of incivility (civil versus uncivil), tolerance (tolerance versus intolerance) and threat (high threat versus low threat). Our findings contribute to the current debate with a more nuanced definition of incivility and add important measurement considerations.	Political Communication

We build on recent theoretical developments on incivility and expose participants to political social media posts varying in the level of incivility (civil versus uncivil), tolerance (tolerance versus intolerance) and threat (high threat versus low threat). Our findings contribute to the current debate with a more nuanced definition of incivility and add important measurement considerations.	Political Communication

White Americans' Reactions to Politicians' Tweets about Race and Religion	153	Recent studies demonstrate that explicit racial appeals are increasingly accepted in American politics. The mechanisms that underlie this increase in acceptability, however, remain unclear. In this project, I investigate the reasons that can make individual voters more or less accepting of explicit racial rhetoric. Using two survey experiments in which respondents are cross-exposed to the real tweets of Democratic and Republican politicians explicitly addressing the issues of race and religion framed in terms of threat (white supremacy and radical Islam), I test two competing hypotheses. One emphasizes the role of partisanship: respondents increase their support for in-party politicians in response to explicit tweets on race and religion from out-part politicians. The other hypothesis can be understood through the lens of “white backlash”: white respondents increase their acceptance of explicit anti-Muslim messages in response to tweets discussing white supremacy as a threat. Overall, I find support for the second hypothesis: when tweets singling out Muslims as a threat are presented after ones mentioning white supremacy, white respondents find the former more acceptable, and this effect is strongest for white Democrats. Analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects further demonstrates that this effect is most strongly moderated by group empathy (more so than by racial resentment and Islamophobia). My results help to shed light on the growing acceptability of explicit racial rhetoric in American politics by underscoring the consequences of cross-exposure to explicit partisan messages on the issues of race and religion.

Although language and text should be secondary to images from a behavioral perspective, until recently scholarly attention was almost exclusively focused on textual analysis. In fact, when we scroll through social media newsfeeds or read a newspaper, images grab our attention first and influence our opinions well before we get to the text itself. Hence, images are meant to prime our evaluations, but do they? How does nontextual information contribute to media bias? What is the mechanism through which nontextual frames promote or mitigate affective political divide? In order to answer these questions, we select a shortlist of political events and track the manner in which ideologically diverse media reported such events on social media. We unsupervised computer vision algorithms to analyze images accompanying these news stories. After, we analyze news short descriptions to identify differences in the sentiment between liberal and conservative media outlets towards the same events. Finally, we conduct a series of online survey experiments in order to identify the exact mechanisms through which images introduce bias and increase the affective divide. Since visual information is more credible than text, we hypothesize that media outlets will attach more sentiment to images accompanying news stories than to the stories themselves. Our starting point for empirical evidence is the US, but we expect that the revealed behavioral mechanisms will be easily generalized to other political environments.	Political Communication

Linking Incivility, Intolerance and Preferences for Content Moderation Online	1146	Incivility is becoming highly relevant in online political communication on social media, and existing scholarship has emphasized the importance of identifying uncivil content and its downstream consequences. At the same time, scholars agree that incivility is a challenging concept to define as, among other things, it is context-dependent. As a result, operationalizations vary widely in the literature, ranging from measurements of the concept as a continuous scale to its decomposition into different dimensions and its decoupling from concepts like intolerance. While this research is growing, we still have insufficient understanding as to whether, for example, intolerance, incivility, and other forms of toxic and threatening behaviour are separate dimensions of undesirable behavior. While past work has shown that incivility and intolerance can occur in different contexts, when it comes to the consequences for individuals, is intolerance an analytically distinct concept from incivility and when exactly do citizens perceive comments as “crossing a line”?

As Romania faced widespread Covid-19 vaccination scepticism, the president appealed to church officials for their support, but they refused. The president’s attempt to create a culturally resonant message for Romanian citizens to vaccinate remained unmet. While the concept of cultural resonance is supposed to explain why audiences adopt certain frames more easily, we lack a systematic understanding of what constitutes cultural resonance, as well as how we can measure its effects in public discourse. This study furthers our understanding of resonance processes in political communication and contributes to framing effects research. To our knowledge, it constitutes the first attempt to study the causal relationship between exposure to culturally congruent frames and resonance outcomes. Furthermore, we investigate whether culturally congruent frames are resonant only when heuristic processing occurs (compared to systematic) and whether having counterarguments present cancels their effect. Lastly, we develop survey measures for resonance outcomes (i.e., issue interpretations that range from unchallenged acceptance of arguments to outright rejection). We conduct an online survey experiment (N=2700) in three national contexts: Romania, Germany, and the UK. The countries were chosen to vary significantly on the individualism vs collectivism national cultural dimension. The more individualist the context, the more should the guilt eliciting policy resonate (UK=89/100). Conversely, the more collectivist the context, the more should the shame policy resonate (Romania=30/100). Germany leans towards individualism (67/100).	Political Communication

I consider six approaches commonly used to evaluate electoral representation, and argue that all are problematic if public opinion both influences and is influenced by elite behavior. I propose and defend a new measurable criterion for effective popular control over elected representatives (and therefore effective electoral representation), 'communicative representation': the degree to which speech by elected legislators represents, as well as responds to, the entire distribution of voter preferences (communicative congruence and communicative responsiveness, respectively). Low (high) communicative representation implies that political actors with certain preferences and priorities have disproportionate (proportionate) presence and influence in public debate, and so disproportionate (proportionate) political power. I illustrate the feasibility and value of this approach by analyzing communicative congruence on immigration and welfare spending in the United Kingdom between 2010 and 2015.

In this paper, substantiated by a meta-analysis result grounded in all related empirical works between 1960 and 2020, we demonstrate that the literature on mass-elite congruence has witnessed a dramatic increase in the past decade. This burgeoning literature, however, has three blind spots which we aim to uncover. First, despite the vast executive powers of presidents and their often-differentiated issue positions from their political parties, the literature has exclusively focused on political parties to the neglect of presidents including in (semi-) presidential democracies. Second, with few exceptions, the literature has not so far distinguished between partisan and independent voters and between voters and non-voters. Given the rise of electoral volatility across the globe, including in Western Europe, it is essential to have such distinctions. Third, the literature has overlooked the study of mass-elite congruence in several new democracies across Africa, Asia and Latin America based on the false premise that political dimensions are antithetical to clientelism. We show, nevertheless, that many of those societies have developed stable political dimensions that often went hand-in-hand with clientelistic or personalistic party-voter linkages. Moreover, based on Eastern European and Northeast Asian examples, we demonstrate that some of these dimensions are internationally, not domestically, rooted reflecting the surrounding geopolitical situations. Bridging these blind spots, we argue, is essential for a more accurate and comprehensive study of mass-elite policy preference congruence in particular and for the study of political representation in general.

Using two unique panel datasets, the Norwegian Citizens Panel and the Panel of Elected Representatives in Norway, I estimate the association between positional views on income taxation among politicians at the time of election, and their tax policy support during their mandate. I find that when voters are keen to punish politicians for not implementing their promises, the elected representatives are more likely to have congruent implementation of the policies that they have promised at the time of election. These effects are even stronger among those representatives that are in government. However, when politicians undermine their voter’s willingness to punish, they are more likely to change their positional view on taxation during the term. These findings have relevant implications on the link between voters’ attitudes to punish and congruent policy position of the elected representatives during their term.	Parties and Representation

Research to date has focused on explaining voters-party congruence as a by-product of political developments and electoral results. Only a few scholars examined the overall effect of voters-party congruence on voting behaviour at the party system level. By creating a new dataset with data from 258 national elections, I examined whether ideological incongruence impacts participation in elections or induces a shift towards anti-political establishment parties. The central hypothesis is that high overall distance between the parties and their voters leads to growing detachment from the party system and hence increased abstention or voting for parties that criticise the traditional parties that form the core of the party system. The results are mixed as the hypotheses are not confirmed in all sample countries. In some parts of Europe, high levels of ideological incongruence are indeed associated with high abstention rates. However, the relationship between the two is not significant in all sample countries and throughout the past five decades.	Parties and Representation

Synonymous with the question of EU salience and politicization, prior research has focused on which political actors are responsible for EU politicization, especially on how pro-European, mainstream parties took over from anti-EU, niche parties the leading role in the EU integration debate. Recently, this tendency was further reinforced at the time of the 2019 EP elections with the emergence of an EP party group, Renew Europe, campaigning on a coherent and strong Europhile platform. In addition, complete opposition toward the EU has been replaced with demands for reform in the EU, presenting new challenges for parties and candidates. We argue that in addition to increasing EU issue salience, these issues also broadened in scope, resulting in an increased embedding into other political issues. While mainstream candidates uniformly broadened the scope of EU issues, candidates of challenger parties (e.g. Green and anti-EU) focused on a restricted embedding, linking EU integration to their core political issues owned within the national political arena, such as immigration and environment. We rely on an original data source that consists of the Twitter communication of candidates for the 2014 and 2019 EP elections across all EU Member States. We use a combination of human coding and machine learning to identify the issue content of this communication and offer both within- and between candidate, analyses to support our main claims.

Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the Five Star Movement in current-day Italy – discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actor in the formulation of these demands? We ask why political parties call and/or support direct democracy. We provide two major motivations: ideology and strategy. Analyzing party manifestos of European parties from 1946 onward, we show how ideological motivations seem to account for most variation in party positions towards direct democracy. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins as well as it helps to better understand whether direct democracy is endogenous with certain outcomes or not.

The electoral and partisan impact of territorial referendums	1008	What are the electoral and partisan consequences of winning or losing a referendum on independence? While part of the literature argues that territorial referendums put in motion a slippery slope towards more (radical) territorial demands and increase the electoral power of regionalist parties, others sustain that territorial referendums on independence are ""once in a generation"" event and they tend to decrease the salience of territorial politics. Combining existing datasets on territorial referendums, and on the position of regional and state-wide parties on the territorial dimension, as well as information on electoral outcomes, this paper examines the effect of winning or losing a territorial referendum on parties' electoral support and parties' territorial position in the subsequent elections. Using OLS regression models and a series of regression discontinuity design, we aim at contributing to the debate on whether parties, either regional or state-wide parties, moderate or radicalize after the celebration of a territorial referendum.

Center-right parties are supposed to choose first, between salience and non-salience and then between pro- vs. anti- migration positions to develop adversarial, accommodating or indifferent strategies. Using insights from the literature on ethnic boundary-making (Wimmer 2013), I argue that center-right parties have wider options allowing them to increase salience of the issue of migration without having to adopt the accommodating/restrictive frame of far-right nativist parties. They may advocate ethnic exclusivity as a criterion for migration and integration policies, but simultaneously expand the definition of mainstream ethnic categories, tie ethnicity to non-ethnic forms of belonging or explicitly flatten ethnic hierarchies through the use of religious or universalist themes. In this way they diversify the signals they send to their potential voters proving that there ""many ways to be right"" (Gidron 2020). To test the interpretive framework I rely on an original coding of party manifestos from national elections in 12 West European democracies since the 1960s to map different reactions of centre-right parties to extreme-right challenges on the issue of migration across countries and over time.

Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the Five Star Movement in current-day Italy – discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actor in the formulation of these demands? We ask why political parties call and/or support direct democracy. We provide two major motivations: ideology and strategy. Analyzing party manifestos of European parties from 1946 onward, we show how ideological motivations seem to account for most variation in party positions towards direct democracy. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins as well as it helps to better understand whether direct democracy is endogenous with certain outcomes or not.

The electoral and partisan impact of territorial referendums	1008	What are the electoral and partisan consequences of winning or losing a referendum on independence? While part of the literature argues that territorial referendums put in motion a slippery slope towards more (radical) territorial demands and increase the electoral power of regionalist parties, others sustain that territorial referendums on independence are ""once in a generation"" event and they tend to decrease the salience of territorial politics. Combining existing datasets on territorial referendums, and on the position of regional and state-wide parties on the territorial dimension, as well as information on electoral outcomes, this paper examines the effect of winning or losing a territorial referendum on parties' electoral support and parties' territorial position in the subsequent elections. Using OLS regression models and a series of regression discontinuity design, we aim at contributing to the debate on whether parties, either regional or state-wide parties, moderate or radicalize after the celebration of a territorial referendum.

Despite being pervasive, little is known about the conditions facilitating different configurations of pre-electoral alliances. This paper presents a model of electoral competition in which parties can form alliances before elections, and decide how binding these should be. Parties face a dynamic trade-off between insuring themselves against large shifts in public opinion and allowing flexibility to respond to future changes in voters’ preferences. The model shows that more binding alliances such as mergers emerge in equilibrium when electoral volatilityis high; otherwise, parties form more flexible pre-electoral coalitions. It also suggests that some power concentration is needed for alliances to emerge in equilibrium, whereas parties run alone under consensual democracies that share power among all parties. These results have implications for the process of party system stabilization.	Formal Models

To answer these questions, we analyze a standard spatial model of elections with two key modifications: There are two distinct groups of voters, and these groups have different costs of voting. We find that as voting costs increase for one group, the party favored by the other group chooses more extreme platforms. However, the probability of one group winning or their vote share does not necessarily change as costs change.	Formal Models

Lawmakers’ so-called ‘auto-limitation’ has attractive properties: Unconstitutional policies are kept off the books without the need for judicial interventions and otherwise overburdened courts need to resolve fewer cases. Contrasting these claims, I argue in this paper that lawmakers who ignore constitutional concerns adopt better policies. I develop a formal model that shows that all too risk-averse lawmakers disproportionately shy away from policies that would survive judicial scrutiny, and hence fail to translate their constituents’ demands into implemented policies. Given that lawmakers possess only imperfect information about how courts would decide their cases in the future, I show that the benefits of lawmakers’ strict auto-limitation are outweighed by its costs. The formal model provides an explanation of why we often observe lawmakers casting constitutional concerns about their policy choices aside, and I make the case that lawmakers’ choice to take constitutional risks is in the interest of both their constituents and courts themselves.

While scholars and policymakers have focused on possible wars arising from accidental or unauthorized clashes or autocratic great powers invading weaker neighbors, this article argues that an alternate pathway--competitive intervention in strategically important states experiencing regime crises--constitutes an alternate significant risk, with clear historical precedent. The political alignment of strategically important states has an outside influence on great power interests, and is something that can quite plausibly be affected over an extended period by external interventions. At the same time, a war that occurred primarily or exclusively within the territory of a secondary state could more plausibly be kept limited--undermining nuclear deterrence--and would not directly conflict with existing norms of territorial integrity. Indeed, I demonstrate that the logic has been a significant source of great power crises and wars throughout history. During the post-WWI period, great power crises occurred more frequently in strategically salient states that were experiencing civil wars or that had experienced irregular regime turnover. In addition, I demonstrate that succession crises arising from the deaths of a monarchs without clear legitimate heirs were an exogenous source of great power war during the monarchic period (1495-1800). I also demonstrate qualitatively that an extended regime crisis in China lay at the heart of the Pacific War in World War II. I conclude the article by discussing implications for the contemporary period, noting in particular the danger of great power war arising from regime instability in either North Korea or Pakistan.

In turn, the proliferation of informal governance mechanisms is glossed as an ad hoc response to new problems, or to the practical difficulties of negotiating new multilateral arrangements. However, supposedly informal governance arrangements can be highly patterned and, arguably, are the consequence of predictable nondecisions in the classic Bachrach-Baratz sense. This paper develops a formal model of the emergence and persistence of informal governance relationships, and illustrates it with two examples: one about narcotics and the other about cybersecurity.

Yet, the question has an application in international relations and it has implications for the foreign policy decision-making processes of democratically elected governments. This paper suggests that a key determinant, beyond the institutional and individual factors leading to defection, lies on the party level. Specifically, I argue that heterogeneity in how 'dovish' a party has positioned itself will affect the party cohesion in votes over military deployment. I leverage temporal variation in party manifesto programs, to assess the preference heterogeneity over 'dovish' preferences. I assess my hypotheses against parties' voting records in military deployment votes. I rely on fixed-effects models and include the mission, the cabinet, the country, and both the country and year to assess the robustness of my results. I show that conditional on whether a party is in the government, heterogeneity in preferences can have a significant impact on the number of defections from the party line. In a subsequent step, I assess the impact of party preference heterogeneity in coalition governments and argue that a lack of overlap in party preferences can encourage individual MPs to signal discontentment with the coalition partner, leading to a greater number of defections. This paper highlights the role of intra- and inter-party preference heterogeneity in foreign policy decision-making. The results have both empirical and theoretical implications for studies relying on the two-level game to explain international cooperation.	International Relations and Conflict

Vogler	University of Konstanz	p	y	0481	Rivalry and Empire: How Competition Among European States Shaped Imperialism	307	For centuries, European history was characterized by a fundamental paradox: While interpolity relationships on the continent were often relatively symmetric—without any dominant power being able to permanently establish a hierarchical relationship to the other major powers—the relationships between European states and polities in other world regions were generally hierarchical and exploitative. How can we explain this major difference? I argue that the symmetry of relationships among states within Europe, particularly in the form of sustained and intense military and economic competition, was constitutive of the exploitative and hierarchical relationships between Europe's states and other parts of the world. Specifically, three mechanisms connect sustained rivalries to imperialism: (1) rulers' desire to improve their relative status/prestige trough colonial conquest; (2) pressure from public budget deficits that amplified colonial exploitation; and (3) the creation of powerful interest groups in the form of navies and armies that were in favor of imperial expansion. Moreover, when territorial conflict over colonies escalated, imperialism could ultimately feed back into interpolity competition in Europe. I demonstrate these dynamics through systematic analyses of the rivalries between France and England (circa 1689–1815, with earlier origins) as well as Imperial Germany and the United Kingdom (circa 1871–1918).

Corvinus University of Budapest.	p	y	0530	Testing the explanatory power of Neoclassical Geopolitics	1320	Most scholars and experts in geopolitics are relatively consensual about the idea that geopolitics disregards the role of individual decision-makers. The main argument of this paper challenges this view, contending that the behavior of the state is understood as nothing but a result of flesh and blood decision-makers’ choices. Starting from the neoclassical realist theory, the pivotal aspect of the paper is to demonstrate that neoclassical realism can offer a more profound contribution to sharpening geopolitical studies than other streams of the realist theoretical school. This contribution is given by the inclusion of intervening variables centered on decision-makers – or geopolitical agents – in geopolitical reasoning. In other words, it is claimed that the exam of geopolitical agents’ perceptions and capacities often provides valuable input to the explanation of political outcomes (i.e. choices of decision-makers) as a study object of geopolitical studies. This paper offers, moreover, methodological steps on how to assess geopolitical agents’ perceptions, namely by identifying geomisguidance in their perception of the geographical setting. Although a healthy skepticism about any grand theory should be conserved in international relations studies – and therefore this paper does not aim at presenting any – an analytical model of foreign policy can be constructed and applied to unpack state’s foreign policy outcomes on a case-to-case basis, and from their interaction, coming to a better understanding of the international system.

According to past research, public opinion categorizes violent actions as terrorism not only by their violence levels but also by cues about the perpetrator and its motivation. However, while this debate focuses primarily on different types of violent actions, real-world elite rhetoric often employs frames of terrorism to describe and delegitimize a broader range of non-violent acts (e.g., legal, economic, or diplomatic measures) against the in-group. In this paper, we use an original survey experiment conducted in Israel to examine whether the explicit invocation of terrorism influences popular perceptions of a rival’s non-violent pressure tactics. In particular, we study whether such frames affect attitudes regarding the legitimacy of non-violent acts, the use of state violence in response, and the willingness of domestic audiences to reach a compromise. The analysis carries important lessons about the influence of hawkish rhetoric on perceptions of terrorism and non-violent actions and has consequences for theories of conflict resolution, audience costs, and the utility (or lack thereof) of non-violent resistance.

There is some evidence that fences mitigate flows of transnational terrorism between contiguous states (Avdan and Gelpi 2017) and, that they can stem cross-border militancy (Braithwaite and Linebarger 2020). Others rebut that walls do little to blunt terrorism (Carter and Ying 2020). The empirical debate remains unresolved because scholarship has not yet taken full account of the networked nature of terrorist groups. Terrorist organizations operate across bases in multiple proximate states, and thereby skirt state surveillance and monitoring by funneling their operatives and resources across borders, planning and executing cross-border attacks, and targeting porous borders. We propose that fences degrade groups’ ability to move transnationally by hurting their ability to move easily across bases and choking off the flows of resources and operatives across contiguous territory. Using a network approach, we identify all states linked through shared borders, and using a diffusion model, we test the effect of border fences on the cross-border spread of groups. We focus on six groups, the Islamic State (ISIS), Abu Nidal, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Palestinian Liberation Front, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaida. On balance, we find that fences decrease the probability that a terrorist group spreads to a neighboring country; however, this effect is not a panacea, which suggests that policymakers and academics need to consider the goals, tactics, and capabilities of specific groups rather than presume that fences provide a ubiquitous cure-all.

Previous studies have explained variation in the number and occurrence of terrorist attacks by rebel group, region, and country per month, year and over longer periods of time. They identify group, country and regime characteristics that make terrorism more likely. However, these measures have not been tested for their predictive performance and theoretical value. This study will fill this gap by testing the predictive power of existing indicators used in the literature to explain the occurrence of terrorism and the number of terrorist attacks and victims per month by known rebel groups. Random forests are used in combination with interpretable machine learning techniques to illustrate findings intuitively and to go beyond standard measures of accuracy, precision and recall. The empirical evidence suggests that while some variables have very high predictive power, other previously identified explanatory factors have limited predictive power. In addition, interaction effects are discovered with implications for future research. In light of these results, data-driven theory building and refinement are a valuable addition to the research process beyond the study of terrorism in civil conflicts.

Our data comprises 400,000 entries of three types of extremist violence: right-wing, left-wing, and Islamist. We connect these data with quasi-random variation in the occurrence of large-scale terrorist attacks around the world. Our analyses show that global terrorist attacks, mostly by Islamist terrorists, reliably predict local right-wing `revenge' attacks against foreigners, and also appear to inspire local Islamist violence. No effect shows for left-wing extremism. Robustness and falsification tests demonstrate that this relationship is likely causal. Further analysis show that the entire effect is mediated by broadband access. Global terrorism only triggers local extremist crime in areas with fast internet. By making distant violent terrorist attacks immediately emotionally relevant, the internet works as an amplifier, making global terrorism even more harmful than it typically atrocious immediate effects would suggest.

Our data comprises 400,000 entries of three types of extremist violence: right-wing, left-wing, and Islamist. We connect these data with quasi-random variation in the occurrence of large-scale terrorist attacks around the world. Our analyses show that global terrorist attacks, mostly by Islamist terrorists, reliably predict local right-wing `revenge' attacks against foreigners, and also appear to inspire local Islamist violence. No effect shows for left-wing extremism. Robustness and falsification tests demonstrate that this relationship is likely causal. Further analysis show that the entire effect is mediated by broadband access. Global terrorism only triggers local extremist crime in areas with fast internet. By making distant violent terrorist attacks immediately emotionally relevant, the internet works as an amplifier, making global terrorism even more harmful than it typically atrocious immediate effects would suggest.

There is some evidence that fences mitigate flows of transnational terrorism between contiguous states (Avdan and Gelpi 2017) and, that they can stem cross-border militancy (Braithwaite and Linebarger 2020). Others rebut that walls do little to blunt terrorism (Carter and Ying 2020). The empirical debate remains unresolved because scholarship has not yet taken full account of the networked nature of terrorist groups. Terrorist organizations operate across bases in multiple proximate states, and thereby skirt state surveillance and monitoring by funneling their operatives and resources across borders, planning and executing cross-border attacks, and targeting porous borders. We propose that fences degrade groups’ ability to move transnationally by hurting their ability to move easily across bases and choking off the flows of resources and operatives across contiguous territory. Using a network approach, we identify all states linked through shared borders, and using a diffusion model, we test the effect of border fences on the cross-border spread of groups. We focus on six groups, the Islamic State (ISIS), Abu Nidal, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Palestinian Liberation Front, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaida. On balance, we find that fences decrease the probability that a terrorist group spreads to a neighboring country; however, this effect is not a panacea, which suggests that policymakers and academics need to consider the goals, tactics, and capabilities of specific groups rather than presume that fences provide a ubiquitous cure-all.

Does trust in public institutions and fiscal capacity co-evolve? Can this co-evolution generate a path dependence that promotes compliance with tax regulations long after the initial reforms? To evaluate these questions, we examine the effect of historical Habsburg imperial rule on current levels of public trust and propensity to avoid income taxation. We trace the history of (at times radical) fiscal reforms by the 18th century Habsburg rulers. These reforms broadened the tax base by establishing land-registries (via cadastral surveys) while expanding access to and provision of public goods. A simple model highlights the role of salient public goods in the evolution and transmission of trust and tax compliance norms. The model motivates our empirical analysis, for which the historical Habsburg rule in contemporary Northern Italy serves as a natural experiment. We conducted online surveys in sister-cities on either side of the long-gone Habsburg border for causal identification. Our within-country design allows us to hold the formal institutions (e.g., enforcement) constant while exploiting the variation in social norms arising from historical differences. To gauge individual propensity to avoid income taxation, we introduce a novel incentivized behavioral choice in the survey -- signing up for pre-paid expert tax consultation vs. receiving an Amazon gift card -- that elicits revealed preference for tax compliance. We demonstrate that higher levels of historically determined public trust have a positive impact on compliance behavior.	Political Economy

How does the risk of crime victimization affect preferences for redistribution compared to other risks that the government is harder to blame for? While socio-economic and context factors affect individual preferences for social policy, not all explanatory factors are purely domestic nor equally influential for social protection demand. Risk that emanates from crime is more easily attributed to state failure than economic risk associated with market liberalization. Different types of risks carry different information about the role of the state in the development of the particular risk. I therefore argue that risks which are less easily attributed to government performance will be met with increased demand for compensation, whereas risks that signal low state capacity increase withdrawal from public social protection programs and support for redistribution. This study compares the impact of crime risk and economic risk on social policy preferences in Brazil, an emerging economy with high variation in globalization-related and domestic risks following from crime. I test the argument with a survey experiment employing original data from a randomized face-to-face survey from Brazil in 2019. The vignette randomizes risks of violence, trade liberalization and migration to compare domestic versus international risks on redistributive preferences. Empirical results corroborate the argument. Brazilians are less supportive of more generous social protection programs when confronted with an increase in violence compared to globalization risks.	Political Economy

Recent research in political economy has demonstrated that economic factors have a striking impact on the support for populist parties. Among the economic factors that affect support for populism, inequality has received surprisingly little attention from scholars. More concretely, the existing literature has totally overlooked the extent to which beliefs in (in)equality can determine citizens’ sympathy towards these parties. I draw on the literatures on other-regarding preferences and economic voting, and argue that individuals care about equality, especially equality of opportunity, and that they will feel dissatisfied with their country’s political system whenever this is unable to provide equal chances to all citizens. I predict then that believing that there is no equality of opportunity will increase the identification with populist parties, whereas it will not increase that with social democrats. I use the 9th round of the European Social Survey to test my hypotheses. I find that my theoretical expectations are substantially valid: believing that there is inequality of opportunity increases the identification with populist parties (with both right-wing and left-wing populist parties) and decreases the identification with social democrats.

We show that the following factors could force a politician to propose an extreme platform: limited political power, high uncertainty, and low cost of information. While the first two factors predictably decrease politician's chances of being elected, we show that cheaper information does not always benefit an extremist politician. Thus, when voters' uncertainty about the future state of the world is high, a politician benefits from cheaper information. In contrast, when uncertainty is low, a politician prefers the information to be less attainable. Finally, we show that, when voters are completely uncertain, even the slightest change in the likelihood of a possible future situation can switch a politician's political agenda from one extreme to another.

Although every country needed to handle this emergency, governments’ responses varied greatly, with some reacting with quicker and more efficient policies than others. Which heads of government reacted the fastest and oversaw policies that were more successful in minimizing casualties and illness? I argue that both the gender of the leader as well as the institutional structure impacted a government’s COVID-19 policy. First, studies have shown that women more than men pay close attention to “care issues” such as welfare, child and family issues, and elder care. As a public health crisis impacting the elderly at higher rates than other age groups, the pandemic naturally aligns with a feminine policy agenda. Thus, I hypothesize that female heads of government had both faster and more efficient responses to the crisis than their male counterparts. Second, I hypothesize that prime ministers had quicker and more effective reactions than presidents due to their need to face fewer veto points in government. However, after interacting gender with government type, I believe that gender should have a larger impact on policy responses to COVID-19 than structure, given the potential expansion of presidential powers in states of emergency. Overall, I hypothesize the order of leaders from fastest and most efficient responses to the pandemic to slowest and least efficient as: female prime ministers, female presidents, male prime ministers, male presidents.

An analysis of female members of cabinets and their influence on climate policies.	543	Previous research on female representatives and their influence on policy has mostly focused on so-called women's issues such as childcare, parental leave, and health care spending. However, studies have shown that women are also more concerned about climate change, which implies that female representation might influence the implementation of climate policies. This question is, however, largely unexplored.This begs the question whether female politicians have a positive impact on climate change policies. This paper addresses this gap at the level of executive bodies of governments. We investigate empirically how female representation at the executive level influences the implementation of climate change policies. We use newly released panel data on members of cabinets over time to measure female representation, and measures of environmental performance of countries over time to examine how female ministers influence agenda setting, policies and spending on climate issues. In line with findings in earlier research on female parliamentarians in the legislative, and research of the executive body on health spending, I expect to find a positive effect of female ministers on climate performance of a country.

Previous literature emphasises the role of the head of government in deciding who gets what in their cabinet. However, in coalition governments, it is the constituting parties who put forward their candidates for ministerial office.Why does this matter for women's representation? As party elites are more likely to be male, I argue that during the early rounds of coalition negotiations, the most important ministerial positions are claimed by men. Left-over positions are filled with women candidates to achieve the gender-balance decision making norm. In contrast, in a single-party government the head of government has more freedom in allocating positions and taking representational issues into account.I measure the importance of portfolios by calculating saliency scores based on party manifestos. Following Bäck et al.'s 2011 paper on the role of portfolio saliency in coalition bargaining, I match cabinet portfolios with codes from the manifesto project to calculate a dynamic score for portfolio saliency that varies over time and between parties. If my intuition is accurate, we should find that in a coalition government, it is rarer for women to be appointed to the most salient positions. This effect should be exacerbated the more parties are members of a coalition.

We put forward that this revolution fostered male status anxiety in two ways. First, increasing female labor market participation increases competition in the labor market for men (“the labor market channel”). Second, by changing gender roles and enabling more financial independence to women, the female revolution diminishes the probability that men will find a wife and increases the probability of separation and divorce for married men (“the marriage market channel”). We test these hypotheses in three studies. The first study uses ESS and WVS matched to administrative data to show how local marriage market context and working place conditions shape attitudes towards women.

A broad literature in political science has attributed the growing success of populist radical right parties to socio-economic transformations that have led to different kinds of grievances among working class and other less skilled and less educated voters. Crucially, newer studies combine economic and cultural perspectives on these transformations and analyze how perceptions of social status affect radical right support. We build on this literature and incorporate a factor that so far has been overlooked in these analyses: variation in gender distribution in different occupations. Anti-feminist discourse plays an increasingly important role in radical right mobilization (Mudde 2019) and we expect that men in occupations with larger shares of female employees should be potentially more susceptible for these appeals for two reasons. First, increasing shares of women can be associated with decreasing wages in a profession. Second, men may perceive it as a status loss to work in a more ‘feminized’ occupation. We empirically test these expectations combining cross-sectional and longitudinal data. We use large-scale labor force survey data from the EU-SILC in order to measure the share of women in an occupation and its development over time. We combine this measure with survey data from the ESS as well as the German socioeconomic panel via ISCO codes and test its effect on electoral behavior. We can demonstrate that the share of women in an occupation indeed constitutes an important determinant of electoral behavior.	Behaviour and Opinion

I examine whether the prohibition of the LGBTQ+ ""panic"" defense, a legal strategy that seeks to blame the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity for the defendant's violent behavior, affects the prevalence of hate crimes. Drawing on the concept of social norms, I argue that legislative measures against this practice decrease the number of hate crimes in two ways. First, by informing individuals about prevailing behavioral rules. Second, by conveying a univocal negative image of norm-breakers. To identify the causal effect of banning this practice, I leverage the gradual roll-out of LGBTQ+ ""panic"" defense bans across the United States and implement a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the introduction of these bills leads to significantly lower levels of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime rates. Consistent with the theoretical argument, this effect gradually increases with length of exposure. Besides contributing to the literature on minority politics, policy feedback and contextual drivers of hate crime, insights gained from this work are of assistance to policy makers and minority rights advocates.

We operationalize this tradeoff as two classes of effects: (1) the effect of toxicity on downstream behavior and (2) the deadweight-loss of moderation procedure on future engagement. Both of these effects are expressed as controlled direct effects (CDEs), as our analyses must condition on a comment's acceptance in order to measure how downstream comments react to it. Intuitively, our estimand is the causal effect in a counterfactual world without pre-publication moderation. We exploit a regression discontinuity design to aid causal inference in this setting, although unlike a traditional natural experiment, this does not provide purely design-based causal inferences. Building on recent work on multiply-robust estimators of CDEs, we present a novel doubly robust estimator under the natural experiment. By decomposing an estimator into its design-based component and its fundamentally observational components, we are able to reduce the number of unverifiable assumptions required for causal inference.

So far, scholars have almost exclusively treated individual elections as individual isolated events. I argue that in the presence of concurrent electoral contests on election day, systematic vote alterations can be detected from 'undervoting irregularities' that emerge if protagonists of fraud fail to interfere into multiple races to equal extents. Conceptually, I introduce the distinction between balanced and unbalanced fraud approaches in the presence of several simultaneous electoral contests. Methodically, I develop statistical methodology to detect and quantify systematic interference that stems from unbalanced fraud approaches and evaluate its performance using a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, I apply the proposed methodology to a number of electoral events from recent Latin American elections and shed new light into current trends of electoral integrity across the Americas. These contributions highlight the relevance of contextual information for the practice of election forensics in general and improve our understanding of undervoting irregularities in particular.

The heterogeneity of trust attitudes in developed democracies	408	I define my study of trust as a methodological-substantive synergy. Specifically, I employ a sophisticated methodological approach to answer the substantively complex question of how citizens trust. My overall framework is person-centred, as I ultimately identify latent subtypes of people based on distinct patterns of trust. Using latent profile analysis, I develop a typology of citizens that represents the heterogeneity of trust attitudes in the European Union. As such, my study differs from the majority of current research, where the focus tends to be on average levels of trust in the population. Rather, I establish that citizens trust in fundamentally different ways, which, in turn, informs the meaning of different levels of trust in the aggregate. I anchor my typology in a preliminary variable-centred analysis, where I determine the most optimal dimensionality of the concept. In particular, I find support for a novel measurement model, which acts as the foundation for the patterns of trust. Further, I show that the dimensional structure of my model has interesting similarities with well-known conceptual definitions, and I consequently argue for the potential of my methodological approach to bring empirical research closer to the rich conceptual literature on the topic.

They are, one could say, dormant parts of the structural foundation we operate within. Puzzled by a series of recent developments such as stagnating political participation, expanding networks of non-political organizations, growing numbers of delegated agencies and occurrence of techno-rational discourses, scholars have found an increased interest in the concept of depoliticization. Yet, even though the concept has been widely discussed, it still lacks a clear conceptualization and operationalization. This again causes difficulties for the accumulation and generalizability of the empirical literature. In this article, I propose a new way of understanding depoliticization. Using ISO standards as a starting point, I treat issues as units and estimate their degree of political orientation. The core measurements of political orientation include actor diversity, language sentiment and time framing. In this way, the article brings forth new insight into how we can quantitatively study depoliticization.	Political Methodology

Assessing the impact of parties’ environmental salience on citizens’ vote in the 2019 European election.	283	The months preceding the 2019 European Parliament election saw an important increase in concern for the environment among EU citizens. As the EU has an extensive environmental acquis and MEPs have competences to work in this domain, it would seem rational for environmentally concerned citizens to use these elections to provide MEPs with a mandate to push for more ambitious environmental legislation.Nonetheless, it has often been stressed that European elections are largely second-order, which implies that citizens mostly vote to express their opinion on national issues and fail to provide MEPs with a mandate to act on EU policies. This has raised some claims that the EU suffers from a democratic deficit, and it could lead to a weak representation of citizens’ environmental concerns. However, as citizens generally acknowledge the importance of environmental action at EU level, I expect to find a connection between parties’ environmental salience during the campaign and citizens’ vote choice in the 2019 European elections.I analyse this by first assessing whether parties’ environmental salience improved their electoral performance at aggregate level. Second, I use multi-level models to investigate whether parties’ environmental salience influenced individuals’ party choice. Finding a connection would indicate that European elections are not simply second order and can provide MEPs with a mandate to act on EU policy-issues, such as the environment.Parties’ environmental salience is computed through a content analysis of tweets that candidates posted during the campaign, using a dictionary approach. Citizens’ data comes from the post-electoral Eurobarometer survey.	European Politics

During this era where online interactions can even replace offline actions, Golden Dawn was the first openly neo-Nazi party after World War II to win seats in the parliament of a European country. Mainstream media banned its leaders indefinitely after Ilias Kasidiaris physically attacked Liana Kanelli, a member of the Greek Communist Party, on live television in June 2012. After the ban, many scholars seem to believe that Golden Dawn mobilised its voters online. This approach played a significant role in spreading their messages on social media while trying to appeal to wider audiences. This study samples 108 YouTube videos shared by Golden Dawn and uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to investigate the party’s activity on YouTube from 2012 to 2019. Official channels and politicians’ personal profiles are analyzed to explore their key messaging and style. Results of my analysis show that Golden Dawn’s messaging is populist, nationalist, extremist, and often adopts negative and emotional language. Additionally, their content openly promotes xenophobia and violence, and aims at causing insurrection by mobilizing supporters or in some cases calls for the executions of political opponents.

A lot of political science work has investigated which factors lead to more or less support for these parties. The literature has usually focused on contextual conditions such as structural transformations or the behavior of established parties. Much less research has been concerned with the behavior of niche parties themselves. In this paper we ask if Green parties can successfully appeal to a more mainstream electorate by broadening their issue appeals or if these strategies lead to strong trade-offs with their core constituency. We leverage a field and a survey experiment in Germany around the 2021 election to tackle this question. In the first study, we run a field experiment on Facebook in collaboration with the German Greens where the party randomizes which policy bundles they use to appeal to a broader electorate. We measure the effectiveness of these policy bundles on the election results in the 2021 Bundestag election.

A lot of political science work has investigated which factors lead to more or less support for these parties. The literature has usually focused on contextual conditions such as structural transformations or the behavior of established parties. Much less research has been concerned with the behavior of niche parties themselves. In this paper we ask if Green parties can successfully appeal to a more mainstream electorate by broadening their issue appeals or if these strategies lead to strong trade-offs with their core constituency. We leverage a field and a survey experiment in Germany around the 2021 election to tackle this question. In the first study, we run a field experiment on Facebook in collaboration with the German Greens where the party randomizes which policy bundles they use to appeal to a broader electorate. We measure the effectiveness of these policy bundles on the election results in the 2021 Bundestag election. In the second study, we measure the effectiveness of the different policy bundles for particular groups of voters in a conjoint and vignette experiment ran on a population representative sample in Germany. Our study has important implications for the scholarship on party competition and helps us understand the rise of environmental politics in Europe.	European Politics

Communicating truth and lies not only relates to the spread of misinformation and disinformation but is also strategically employed by different actors to relativize the truth as a shared assessment of reality. This paper analyzes the discourses of truth contestation to assess how truth and lies were discursively constructed and used by different societal and political actors in Austrian and Czech news media. We analyze the print versions of the three most popular national newspapers with different political leanings (conservative vs. liberal) and journalistic routines (tabloid vs. broadsheet), and two most popular disinformation online media platforms per country, for which we expect wealthy material for analysis. Based on a selection of seed words covering the truth-lie polarity, we then use automated content analysis, more specifically latent semantic scaling, to scale media coverage on migration regarding the prominence and dynamics of truth contestation. Building on a post-truth political communication approach, we cover the period of 2013-2020 and take a comparative perspective looking for country and newspaper differences, with a special focus on the political actors driving such discourse relying on named entity recognition techniques. Overall, our study contributes to the debate by offering insights into the dynamics of truth contestation as a pressing challenge to the functioning of democracy.	Political Communication

Despite their popularity, growing concerns about vague definitions are complemented by empirical evidence that contests their widespread existence. Yet, today's political media environment does offer ample opportunities for human and/or algorithmic selection processeswith undesirable outcomes.To reconcile these two observations, I suggest a framework based on so-called feedback loops. It explains how processes can be re-inforcing, yet not lead to catastrophic consequences. This can solve the paradox that extrapolating from typical filter bubble and/or echo chamber models leads to the conclusion of full radicalization within short timeframes, which despite the presence of the technologies for years has not become omnipresent. I argue that typical characteristics of complex systems, such as non-linearity, the co-esisting of positive (reinforcing) and negative (dampening) feedback loops, as well as the existance of endogeneous forces can explain such seemingly contradictory observations.To systematisize the study of such mechanisms, I suggest to distinguish between human feedback loops, algorithmic feedback loops, and interactions between those. I highlight three specific societal concerns that can benefit from a feedback-loop lens and discuss the spread of mis- and disinformation, the normalization of extreme content, and the radicalization of fringe groups.The paper offers a series of propositions as well as suggestions for empirical approaches (in particular, the use of simulation, agent-based testing, experience sampling, and data donations), to enable building better theories of political communication in the digital society.

But how important is the voice pitch in comparison to a candidate’s political position? Does having a lower voice really matter when compared against the standard dimensions on which voters are thought to evaluate candidates, and if so, how much? How does the trade-off between voice-pitch and policy-stance depend on the candidate’s gender, the socio-economic characteristics of the voter, and the policy-issues on which the candidates contend? The objective of our study is to answer these questions, using an experimental methodology. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to approach these questions. We corroborate the earlier literature in the existence of a voice-pitch bias. Furthermore, we find that voice-pitch bias is higher for male than for female candidates. However, the voice-pitch bias voters display is several times more persistent against policy differences among candidates when evaluating female as opposed to male candidates. Overall, even though male candidates face a higher voice-pitch bias absent policy differences, it is easier for them to correct for it by differentiating themselves on the policy dimension. Parallel with the earlier literature, we find that a lower voice pitch creates a perception of higher competence and higher trustworthiness, both for male and female candidates.	Political Methodology

The British Labour Party and the Politics of White Working Class Representation	471	Throughout western democracies, centre-left parties face challenges in trying to hold together their increasingly fractious coalition of the white working class, middle class graduates, and ethnic minorities. An influential argument holds that these parties have lost a lot of support amongst their traditional white working class base through their efforts to promote and cater to ethnic minority interests. While the extent of a trade-off between white and non-white voters has been extensively discussed in the context of the United States, empirical evaluations of this subject are much more scarce in Europe, where the sizes of different race and class groups, as well as the histories of racial and class politics, are quite different. Furthermore, the possibility that social democrats might compensate for the loss of white working class supporters by appealing to the growing graduate professional electorate, who might be assumed to feel less threatened by ethnic minority interest promotion, has not been thoroughly explored. Our paper uses the long-running British Election Study as well as the more recent British Election Study Internet Panel to explore these topics. We assess the extent to which voters see working class and ethnic minority interests as compatable and how perceptions of Labour's absolute and relative success in looking after these groups' interests shapes voting behaviour for different parts of the electorate. Our paper helps fill a notable gap in empirical studies of the politics of race and class representation in Europe.	Parties and Representation

This study draws on social psychological theories of automatic social categorization and recognition effects to argue that familiarity can help reduce voters' bias against minority candidates. The persistent underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in political office, I argue, prevents voters from automatically ascribing relevant traits to minority candidates. To test this hypothesis, I experimentally manipulate voters' subliminal familiarity with candidates by exposing them to a series of synthetic images created by General Adversarial Networks (GANs) that show faces of fictional political candidates. Half of these photorealistic, high-quality images contain subtle visual features of known, real-world minority politicians, evoking subconscious feelings of familiarity in voters. The other half, instead, contains features of unknown, hypothetical minority candidates. Drawing on a large set of such synthetic images that offer rich variance in other relevant candidate features, I propose two experimental studies. Study 1 examines the effects of subliminal familiarity on voting decisions, while Study 2 aims to understand to what extent subliminal familiarity affects the inferences voters make about candidate characteristics. In both studies, I examine whether some voters are more susceptible to subliminal recognition effects than others and whether their partisan identity and level of political sophistication can explain any such potential variance. Not only do the results of this study contribute to our understanding of subconscious processes that influence voters' decision-making, they also have important implications for policies aimed at improving the quality of descriptive representation in modern democracies.

The reforms either created new regional administrations, which were elected (e.g. the United Kingdom 1999) or introduced a popular vote in the already established region (e.g. Greece 1994). Decentralisation reforms have a particular effect on the regional parties, which are limited by the area of their operation. The paper will focus on Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru - the Party of Wales and their transformation since establishing regional institutions: Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales (later Welsh Parliament). The background conditions and the main purpose leading to the establishment of both parties differed significantly and played an important role throughout their existence. Since its establishment, the Scottish National Party has demanded Scotland's independence, while Plaid Cymru was formed mainly to protect Welsh culture and language. Both regional parties had to adapt to the new conditions and create a new strategy for the new political environment. The paper will analyse the impact of the devolution on their political agenda, demands on the national centre and change in the internal organisation structure. Moreover, it should show how those changes have impacted electoral results at both regional and national levels. Further comparison of the two regional parties with similar institutional backgrounds should determine the main differences in the development of Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru in the past two decades.

Over the past two decades immigrants have become an emerging political force in advanced democracies. Yet, little is known about the electoral choices of immigrants, and the studies that do exist are largely descriptive. This study fills this lacuna and studies immigrants’ voting behavior in a comparative perspective. It examines whether social integration of immigrants into the host society might drive them into shifting their support from their group’s voting norms. We theorize that immigrants who face social exclusion and discrimination are likely to follow their group’s voting norms more so than those who are well integrated. We further suggest a number of testable explanations for these patterns: (1) integrated immigrants’ ties to their migrant community are weaker, thus they adhere less to it norms; (2) integrated immigrants may want to symbolically distance themselves from their migrant community and signal their separation from it using their vote choice; (3) as integrated immigrants usually enjoy an improved socio-economic status they may no longer need the social benefits provided by the left – the main political mobilizer of immigrants. Using public opinion survey data we study whether the level of social integration of immigrants is linked to vote choice. Our findings have important implications for theory and policy, suggesting that in the long-run leftwing parties lose support as a consequence of immigrants’ integration into the host society.

This study adds the difference between wholesale and partial alternation: that is, the difference between those countries where, whenever governments change, all incumbent parties leave office (wholesale alternation), and those countries where only some of the incumbent parties leave office when governments change, while some remain (partial alternation). This distinction may form an important missing variable for the institutional determinants of political efficacy, in particular external efficacy, i.e., an individual’s perceptions about the responsiveness of politicians to citizen demands. In countries with wholesale alternation, elections effectively decide who gets into power, independent of whether a proportional and majoritarian electoral system is used. Citizens are likely to experience higher political efficacy here. In systems with partial alternation, backroom negotiations instead of elections are the crucial forum for government formation.

Using data on the 2019 protests of Bolivia and Chile, along with election results at the municipal level of the elections that took place during previous years, and 2020 elections (after the protests), we use difference-in-differences models to assess if (1) protest occurrence influences voter turnout within the municipality they occur, compared to those municipalities that had lower or none protest activity, (2) protest occurrence changes political preferences, compared to previous elections and (3) if episodes of repression of these protests by law enforcement officials mediate the relationship between protest and electoral behavior.

The effect of institutional allies on the responsiveness of political parties towards protests	531	Only recently have scholars turned their attention to the connection and interplay between protest mobilisation and electoral politics – often with mixed findings. This manuscript contributes to the growing field by exploring the extent to which political parties respond to protests in their parliamentary questions, and how this responsiveness might be affected by the existence of institutional allies, i.e. political parties with an ideological affinity to the protests and a shared set of goals. On the one hand, institutional allies can represent an electoral alternative for voters who deem the protests’ issue important, creating a potential electoral backlash for parties who remain unresponsive. On the other hand, responding to protest mobilisation in the presence of institutional allies can also strengthen the institutional allies due to their strong issue ownership – leaving parties with little choice but to remain silent. The empirical analysis examines two ideal types of institutional allies – environmental parties and anti-immigration parties in Germany from 1975 to 2020. By using a regression discontinuity design and mixed methods to assess the effect of protest mobilisation in parliamentary questions, the manuscript addresses some of the long-standing methodological concerns of research on the consequences of protests and social movements.

This study adds the difference between wholesale and partial alternation: that is, the difference between those countries where, whenever governments change, all incumbent parties leave office (wholesale alternation), and those countries where only some of the incumbent parties leave office when governments change, while some remain (partial alternation). This distinction may form an important missing variable for the institutional determinants of political efficacy, in particular external efficacy, i.e., an individual’s perceptions about the responsiveness of politicians to citizen demands.

While research has measured donor performance and ranked donors on the quality of their aid, we know little about the relationship between the international rhetoric on what makes aid giving effective and donors’ actual aid giving choices. In this project, we focus on a historically common donor practice that has been widely recognized as hurtful for aid effectiveness: that of “tying” foreign aid. Foreign aid is “tied” when a donor requires that portions of its aid be spent on goods and services from firms in its home country. We collect and clean a corpus of 161 OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) documents, including 40 annual Development Cooperation Reports (1980–2020) and 121 peer reviews (1996–2020). We employ quantitative text analysis methods to measure donor discourse on the topic of tied aid both at the year and at the donor-year level. We compare this discourse to data on prior and subsequent actual amounts of tied aid in aid commitments and disbursements over the past four decades. For all DAC donors, we assess whether the tied aid discourse in DAC documents (i) responds to the actual donor practice of aid tying and/or (ii) influences subsequent decisions of donors to tie their aid. We find robust evidence of the former and some evidence of the latter.	International Relations and Conflict

Yet, limited by the notion that 'security is a speech act' (Buzan et al., 1998) the wide range of actors and the processes of collaboration, negotiation, and dissent from which securitization is conceived have been understudied. This article makes a claim to move beyond the speech act to conceive securitization as a discourse network and explore the chain of associations and propagation processes that lead to the formation of (in)security. We propose that securitization behaves as a complex system of coalitions where actors adopt (in)security beliefs from other actors and form network dependencies both in cross-sectional and longitudinal ways (Leifeld & Brandenberger, 2019). To substantiate this claim, the study combines quantitative text and network analysis to examine over 10 million Twitter messages shared by five actor groups in the months leading up to the 45th G7 summit: politicians and governmental institutions, the media, advocates, politicians' folowees, and citizens on Twitter. We find that securitization is constructed by networks of elite and non-elite actors who collectively contribute to the debate, helping to propagate the (in)security discourse.

States and rebel groups must consider the repercussions of their actions if they have been found to violate human rights. The literature accounts for why states sign onto and comply with international human rights treaties; however, this paper seeks to explain why rebel groups may comply to human right commitments as well. We argue that making commitments to human rights allows rebels to establish a relatively cheap form of legitimacy. We test this by examining the effectiveness of three types of rebel commitments to human rights: 1) bilateral treaties, 2) unilateral statements, and 3) internal rules and regulations. We find that internal rules and regulations implemented by rebels produce the best human rights outcomes in terms of reducing civilian deaths. We argue this finding is due to internal rules and regulations commitments being specifically applied to rebel soldier's battlefield behavior. Using text analysis, we then examine what type of language generates the higher rate of compliance associated with internal rules and regulations. We also acknowledge that women experience conflict differently than other populations. Rebel humanitarian commitments also impact women differently as some include specific provisions pertaining to women’s concerns while, others do not. Therefore, we also test how gendered language within these commitments impact women, specifically sexual violence against them during civil conflict.	International Relations and Conflict

We consider support for these policies as well as for traditional compensation. We present hypotehses about the relationship between automation risk and different classes of policy preferences with distinct redistributive consequences. Using original survey data from a panel study conducted in Spain in 2018 and 2021 that captures multiple measures of automation risk, we find that workers who are at higher risk prefer policies to prevent or slow down automation technology at the firm level, but we do not find higher support for more traditional redistribution or compensation.

Traditionally, party systems have changed due to large processes such as the industrial revolution or, more recently, globalization. We argue that digitalization constitutes a similarly profound technological change, affecting society and, consequentially, politics. Technological change induced by digitalization has already led to myriad regulations, transnational legal frameworks and jurisprudence in just about every corner of the world. Novel challenges and opportunities of digitalization increasingly enter the political arena. To what extent can the digital revolution (and subsequent politicization thereof) lead to the emergence of a new cleavage? We theorize that if objective conditions that predict how one is affected by digitalization (i.e. labour market position, education, digital skills) align with subjective identifications (e.g. perception of gaining or losing from further digitalization of society, aligning social identities), this provides fertile breeding ground for a nascent political conflict between what we conceptualize as “winners” and “losers” of digitalization. Our theoretical considerations are complemented with original focus group data and exploratory analysis of cross-national survey data. The paper discusses to what extent we can observe the start of a socio-structural divide ­­– with potential for further politicization ­– caused by the digital revolution in Western societies.

We contribute to the literature by examining the political effects of the growth of the salmon fish farming industry in Norway, which created new tasks and more demand for low-skilled labour in local labour markets. We document the labour market effects and ask whether the positive development has shifted the local support for parties such as the Progress Party. To study this we use an Instrumental Variables approach, leveraging that geographic characteristics determine the local feasibility of salmon fish farming. Despite a positive development for low-skilled workers, we find political effects that are quite similar to those in the ``left-behind'' literature, as support for the Progress Party increased. Our results show that this is due to a right-wing shift on the economic, rather than the cultural, dimension. We interpret the results in light of the structure of party competition in Norway.

Today, 95% of territories regulate hours, representing a massive increase from 0 at the start of the 19th century. The data show that extensive regulations were enacted in colonial dependencies starting in the 1920s. This raised the question, What drives adoption of working-time regulation in colonies? I argue that colonial administrators adopt labor regulation to justify continued imperial rule in the face of new international standards and norms. Descriptive and regression results support this conclusion, with the long-term effects of colonization persisting today.	Comparative Politics

Why do some individulas are more likely to vote for such parties, but not others? We show that the answer lies not only in some individual’s economic or cultural charateristics, as commonly assumed, but also in the ways voters tell their national story. National stories and the relational linkages they draw between the nation and out-groups powerfully shape voter behavior. Data from original representative election surveys conducted between 2012 and 2016 in Denmark, the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom are subjected to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), which reveals voting patterns that are highly structured by national stories. Further analysis, in which we estimate multivariate vote choice models, reveals that voters who hold stories incorporating survival past and confrontational future are more likely to vote for populist parties. These findings hold across our four cases. We conclude by suggesting that narrative approaches can be a valuable approach to study populism, both theoretically and empirically.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, large N studies that tried to identify commonalities of left- and right-wing populist voters shed a light on a more complicated picture. When tested empirically, most of the features that were thought to be common to populist supporters across ideologies show diverse tendencies across countries (e.g. Rooduijn, 2018). It thus seems that beyond sharing the thin populist ideology, voters of populist parties do not have much in common. It must, however, be noted that studies across cases are few, and except for Rooduijn (2018) most of them either focus on few countries (e.g., Pauwels, 2014), or address only one or few dimensions of the populist electoral base (e.g., Krause and Wagner, 2021). Furthermore, they all focus on a single time-point: something that received little, if none, scholarly attention is the presence of a “populist voter” over time, or to use other words, if there was ever a “populist voter”. Thus, this study explores the presence of commonalities among the voter base of populist parties across countries and across time, by using nine waves of ESS data (2002-2018), on seven countries that have had established and successful populist parties for the whole period.

Why do some individulas are more likely to vote for such parties, but not others? We show that the answer lies not only in some individual’s economic or cultural charateristics, as commonly assumed, but also in the ways voters tell their national story. National stories and the relational linkages they draw between the nation and out-groups powerfully shape voter behavior. Data from original representative election surveys conducted between 2012 and 2016 in Denmark, the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom are subjected to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), which reveals voting patterns that are highly structured by national stories. Further analysis, in which we estimate multivariate vote choice models, reveals that voters who hold stories incorporating survival past and confrontational future are more likely to vote for populist parties. These findings hold across our four cases. We conclude by suggesting that narrative approaches can be a valuable approach to study populism, both theoretically and empirically.	Behaviour and Opinion

Do such appeals have a mobilizing effect among voters? We address this question using a vignette experiment embedded into an original, nationally representative survey in Turkey (N=1,648) fielded ahead of the June 2018 general elections. Turkey is an ideal case for this question given that a party with a clearly populist agenda, the Jus tice and Development Party (AKP), has long been in power. Respondents in the survey are randomly assigned into one of the four experimental conditions in which a policy issue (an increase in minimum wage) is cast in populist and non-populist framings. We measure respondents’ emotional reactions to different framings of the issue and also ask about their propensity to engage in collective action (signing petition and protesting) about the issue. We also conduct analyses across different subgroups of the sample.	Behaviour and Opinion

Pundits and scholars alike have been speculating frequently that the populist argumentative style could affect voters’ preferences and thus affect populist candidates’ successes. However, there is surprisingly little research that systematically scrutinizes this widely held assumption. To fill this gap, this survey experiment focuses on the effects of populist arguments by various political candidates in communicating their positions on a variety of political issues. We argue that populist arguments could affect candidates’ electoral fortunes through two channels: First, directly by changing voters’ evaluations of the candidate, and second, indirectly by changing voters’ positions on an issue, which may have long-term consequences for electoral competition. We explore these two potential routes with a single-profile vignette survey experiment (before / after design) on a nationally representative sample of voters in the UK. By differentiating these two dimensions of populist appeal we make two significant contributions. First, to the literature on populism which, thus far, has an insufficient understanding of how populist rhetoric works. And, second, to the literature that investigates the efficacy of different communication strategies to which we add a new dimension: the effects of different rhetorical strategies on the evaluation of the respective candidate.

Previous studies (Spies et al. 2020) demonstrated that the causal models underlying individual voting participation are the same across immigrant-origin and native voters, i.e. lower levels on positive determinants or higher levels on negative determinants add up to lower turnout in these models. Why is that? Are immigrant-origin voters different because they grew up differently, because they have other resource levels or because they are mobilised differently by political actors? Or a combination of these explanations? This paper integrates theoretical notions of voting abstinence across both immigrant-origin and native voting groups by differentiating between:(a) socialisation experiences (voters are less socialised into political activity when their parents are less integrated politically),(b) resources (voters have fewer resources for voting, such as education, or knowledge about the political system) and(c) mobilisation (political parties mobilise voters differently, depending on strategic considerations and residence patterns).In a new novel data set of the Immigrant German Election Study 2021, the paper tests pre-registered hypotheses on representative samples from several immigrant-origin and the native groups in the 2021 Bundestag election. Path models, using temporal sequence in a panel survey structure and endogenous intermediary variables, are employed to test the expectations. The empirical findings help to explain the consistent puzzle of lower turnout among immigrant-origin voters by the integration of theoretical explanations of abstention across all voters.

Once citizens have established themselves as voters or abstainers, they simply follow this pattern during following elections. Naturally, young citizens who just became eligible to vote lack such a habit and consequently show higher volatility in turnout than older cohorts. Theoretically then, the non-habit of voting or abstaining makes young citizens especially susceptible to contextual effects. For instance, they may participate in elections that are especially contested or accompanied by innovative or intense (media) campaigns. Scholars such as Franklin (2004) even argue that the general decline in turnout across established democracies follows from changes in institutional rules and elections’ character over the last decades, which had particularly strong (negative) effects on newer voting cohorts. Similarly, the not yet fully developed civic skills makes young citizens more prone to effects from the environment they live in (e.g. Harrop et al. 1991).Yet, extant research has only scantly tackled the differential influence of contextual effects on turnout across age and related voting habits. Looking at the case of Switzerland, a country with one of the highest age turnout gaps (Fieldhouse et al. 2007), we test the claim of particularly strong contextual effects on turnout among younger citizens. Using registered turnout data across over 40 votes and examining both contextual variables from the campaigns and geographical environments, our multilevel, cross-classified models provide a comprehensive answer whether young voters are indeed more influenced by the context than the elder population.

Conventional forms such as voting in elections are obviously important because they influence who are elected for office. Yet, a single vote is unlikely to change election outcomes, and casting a ballot only provides a narrow signal about the preferences of voters. In contrast, direct use of political voice – when voters inform elected politicians about their concerns and preferences – is a stronger and richer signal. Use of voice may thus be a more motivating form of political participation. In this project we hypothesize that appealing to citizens to voice their opinions – and to provide them with easy access to do so – will have an impact on not only their use of voice, but also on voting. We test this in a field experiment where we randomly assign all young voters (18-30 years) in a local government election (n≈100,000) to either (1) an appeal to voice, (2) both an appeal and an opportunity to voice or (3) an untreated control group.

This leaves them under-represented in policy-making and has prompted increased interest in policies that could encourage greater first-time voter turnout. Research on volunteering suggests that schemes such as National Citizen Service or European Voluntary Service could meet such a need, arguing that volunteering provides an opportunity to develop the social capital, political awareness and skills that encourage electoral participation. Such research suffers, however, from limited use of panel data with information on volunteering in childhood and voting in adulthood, and enabling researchers to control for causally antecedent factors encouraging both childhood volunteering and adult voting.This study overcomes this limitation and provides the most robust analysis to date of the effect of childhood volunteering on first-time voter turnout. Using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study and structural equation modelling, it shows that the benefits of childhood volunteering are frequently exaggerated because of a failure to account for childhood political interest and the political characteristics of parents during one's early socialisation. It also shows, however, that childhood volunteering does have a positive effect for those children raised by politically disengaged parents, who would otherwise be unlikely to develop an interest in political affairs. This means that while the benefits of volunteering schemes for democratic participation are frequently exaggerated, they do have the potential to help address generational turnout decline.

The empirical analysis is based on the European Social Survey, and it covers the 8th and the 9th wave (2016-2019). Through linear regression models, the causal relationship between socio-demographic factors and political participation is examined, in comparison with the benchmark. Results are exhibited for each of the different modes of manifest political participation, which are institutional and non-institutional participation, and electoral participation. Then the analysis focuses on two attitudinal factors that are traditionally considered predictors of political participation: latent political participation and external efficacy. Two hypothesis are tested: In comparison with the benchmark, in the Visegrad countries latent political participation is a weaker predictor of political participation, while external efficacy is a stronger predictor of political participation. The different modes of manifest political participation are considered. Finally, differences among the V4 countries are highlighted.	Behaviour and Opinion

As such, subjective class identification with the working class can be understood as a driver of unconventional or protest participation. On the other hand, professional objective class positions can also be linked to higher levels of participation from the standpoint of the resource model. In this paper, we investigate the patterns that link class — both subjective, in terms of identification, and objective, in terms of occupation and labour market position — to both conventional and unconventional political participation. While the class cleavage is said to have become progressively less salient during the post-war period, we examine the extent to which it still holds relevance in both its objective and subjective types for political participation. Moreover, the rise of new value cleavages from the 1960s onwards is understood to have broadened the class bases of protest participation to include middle-class professionals. Recently, the economic crisis and the rise of movements against austerity have revamped the interest of scholars in the social bases of protest and the role of class in the emergence of the massive anti-austerity protest wave of the Great Recession. We analyse the role of subjective and objective social class for conventional and unconventional political participation with a detailed original cross-national survey conducted in 2015 in nine European countries.

But studies to date have focused predominantly on the act of voting, to the exclusion of other forms of participation. Those that look beyond voting focus on participation that includes deliberation (juries) or decision-making (participatory budgeting). Do other forms of civic participation have the same effects? Answering this question is challenging because the choice to participate confounds our ability to identify causal effects. I therefore turn to a unique natural experiment in Peru. Prior to every election, Peruvian officials randomly select citizens to serve as poll workers (miembros de mesa) on Election Day. Following the January 2020 congressional elections, I conducted a two-wave panel survey of these randomly selected poll workers and also randomly selected alternates. Comparing these two groups allows me to identify the causal effect of this civic participation on political attitudes. I find that civic participation increases support for and trust in democratic institutions, especially elections. I also find that it increases political efficacy and engagement. But I find suggestive evidence that these effects are conditioned by the degree to which the poll monitor had a positive experience. Civic participation does foster democratic attitudes, as long as that participation reflects well on the political system.	Behaviour and Opinion

We argue that observing regime agents targeting vulnerable groups causes a psychological dissonance between individuals' sense of regime legitimacy and the observed moral transgression. As a result, regime support should decrease among witnesses of regime atrocities. To test this hypothesis, we analyze original, highly disaggregated archival data from the so-called Nazi ""Death Marches'' at the end of World War II. In contrast to the Nazis' crimes inside the concentration camps, the death marches confronted ordinary German citizens with the regime's mass violence. We find that municipalities exposed to a high number of deaths display a lower vote share for post-WWII right-wing nationalist parties. In line with our proposed mechanism, we show that (1) this effect is particularly visible in time periods when Nazi crimes were politically salient in post-WWII Germany and (2) that death march exposure is associated with psychological and social disengagement in historical survey data. Our findings have implications for the durability of authoritarian regimes and democratization prospects.	Comparative Politics

In this paper, I examine the role that a radio station captured by Franco's army in the first days of the Spanish Civil War played in the number of casualties in territories they controlled during the war. Using a measure of radio signal strength, I estimate the causal effect of radio availability on the number of killings perpetrated by Republican and Francoist forces. In contrast to recent work, I find that access to radio propaganda reduced violence. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in radio signal strength is associated with a 36% decrease in the number of rebel killings in rebel-controlled territories. The evidence presented suggests that radio demobilized Republicans, which helped Franco consolidate power in areas under his control.	Comparative Politics

In this paper, we problematize this view noting that for reasons of expediency political entrepreneurs sometimes seek to alter the memories of violence through manipulation of historical memory post-conflict. To test whether the manipulation of historical memory alters the legacies of violence we study municipalities located to either side of the Lleida line, a battlefront in Catalonia that had been stable for some time during the Spanish Civil War. The intensity of violence to either side of this line varied for reasons that were plausibly exogenous to the political preferences of local inhabitants. Leveraging the data on actual violence during the civil war and in its aftermath, a detailed dataset that we constructed on historical memorials in this area, and outcome measures of political preferences and behavior from an original survey and electoral records we ask whether (i) the pattern of memorialization faithfully reflects the experience of violence, and (ii) whether present-day attitudes and behavior are more a legacy of the original experience of violence or of the subsequent policy of memorialization. We find that the link between civil war violence and memorialization is not always tight and that contemporary attitudes are often a product of memorialization rather than the original experience of violence. These findings suggest an important corrective in the field of legacy studies.	Comparative Politics

Previous research indicate that it is more difficult for business interest groups to influence policy outcomes during periods of higher political salience, such as the global financial crisis. I argue that while at the onset of the crisis the success rate decreased, this is no longer the case at a later stage.On the basis of the preference attainment approach, this paper seeks to analyse the congruence between business interest groups preferences and the political decisions before and after the global financial crisis. Empirically, I analyse three economic policies characterized by higher levels of issue salience: financial regulation, tax policy and corporate governance. The paper focus on Switzerland, given not only the important role operated by its financial sector, but also its corporatism democracy model, since recent research argue that the parliamentary arena has gained in importance vis-à-vis the executive one in corporatist countries. In doing so, the effectiveness of business interest groups’ lobbying is measured by comparing their preferences with the decisions taken in the economic affairs and taxation committees. Methodically, I make use of a novel database relying on the committees’ protocols of 60 policy issues for four legislations (1999 to 2015), which are analysed with quantitative text analyses. The findings will contribute to combine theories on issue salience, on interest groups’ success and on lobbying activities within the parliament.	Legislative Studies

In this paper, we investigate whether different policy domains moder-ate the effect of anxiety on the MPs’ willingness to policy learning. It is often arguedthat the increasing amount of policy failure can be explained in the lack of policylearning by decision makers. While previous studies show that socio-economic andpartisan variables are related to the perception of policy information, little attentionhas been paid to the role of emotions in the policy making process. We contributeto this literature by applying the Marcus’ Affective Intelligence Model that stud-ies how emotions affect individuals’ processing of information. To do so, we willrely on experimental data conducted amongst MPs from the 26 Swiss cantons, inwhich we randomize images that are shown together with policy information. Thisanalysis will allow us to investigate for causal relationships between emotions andpolicy learning. Hence, our findings might offer important implications in order tounderstand how information through various sources influence legislative attitudesand behavior.	Legislative Studies

Poor quality legislation cannot be easily implemented and enforced, and moreover, can be easily challenged. Despite the great attention to this topic, the literature has used simplistic measures of legislative quality and has not provided a robust analysis of its effects. By building on recent developments in NLP, we look at the syntactic and lexical features of the language of legal texts to measure complexity and ambiguity. We apply these measures to a dataset of EU legislation, containing detailed information on its implementation and decision-making process. We find that complex and ambiguous acts are less likely to be implemented.	Legislative Studies

Despite the great attention to this topic, the literature has used simplistic measures of legislative quality and has not provided a robust analysis of its effects. By building on recent developments in NLP, we look at the syntactic and lexical features of the language of legal texts to measure complexity and ambiguity. We apply these measures to a dataset of EU legislation, containing detailed information on its implementation and decision-making process. We find that complex and ambiguous acts are less likely to be implemented.	Legislative Studies

In this paper, we investigate whether different policy domains moder-ate the effect of anxiety on the MPs’ willingness to policy learning. It is often arguedthat the increasing amount of policy failure can be explained in the lack of policylearning by decision makers. While previous studies show that socio-economic andpartisan variables are related to the perception of policy information, little attentionhas been paid to the role of emotions in the policy making process. We contributeto this literature by applying the Marcus’ Affective Intelligence Model that stud-ies how emotions affect individuals’ processing of information. To do so, we willrely on experimental data conducted amongst MPs from the 26 Swiss cantons, inwhich we randomize images that are shown together with policy information. Thisanalysis will allow us to investigate for causal relationships between emotions andpolicy learning. Hence, our findings might offer important implications in order tounderstand how information through various sources influence legislative attitudesand behavior.	Legislative Studies

This provides an incentive for politicians to feign, whereby they publicly propose policies that voters demand but then privately exert little effort toward progressing such policies. This feigning behavior is more likely to occur when the politician's preferred agenda is close to the status-quo or when the politician is an ineffective legislator. My model predicts that under certain conditions, such as a trade shock, less effective legislators will be more likely to publicly support policies that voters demand and will be reelected with higher probability than more effective legislators. Focusing on U.S. House elections, I provide suggestive evidence that supports these predictions.	Formal Models

While existing work focuses on how crises impact voters’ demand for reform, we instead investigate how they alter politicians’ incentives to supply policy experimentation, even if the crisis does not shift voters' policy preferences. To study this problem, we develop a model of elections and policy experimentation. In our setting, voters face uncertainty about their optimal policy and politicians’ ability to manage a crisis. We show that extreme reforms generate more information for voters about their optimal platform. Consequently, the incumbent has electoral incentives to engage in information control. At the same time, a crisis represents an exogenous test for the incumbent, who must prove competent enough to successfully manage the country during turbulent times. Therefore, a crisis has an (independent) impact on the incumbent's electoral prospects, and this may influence his incentives to engage in risky policy experiments. We find that, in contrast to the conventional wisdom, a crisis induces bolder policy reforms only when the incumbent is sufficiently likely to be competent. If the incumbent is relatively unlikely to be competent, then the crisis instead results in policies that are closer to the status quo. As such, our model qualifies the standard intuition on this matter, and potentially allows us to make sense of the mixed results emerging in the empirical literature.	Formal Models

I derive three broad categories of perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBEs), namely polarized, technocratic, and populist equilibria, and show how the equilibrium reelection rule may change under different assumptions about the information structure, i.e., depending on whether voters are only able to observe policy outcomes, inputs, and/or outputs. I find that in contexts where governments are perceived to have little control over implemented policy and economic performance, i.e., in a ""systemic"" environment, voters do not look to outcomes but rather inputs in deciding whether to reelect a ""responsive"" (congruent) incumbent (i.e., ""input legitimacy""). The observation of the incumbent's input in itself provides voters with information about the incumbent’s type irrespective of policy outputs and outcomes. On the other hand, when the underlying policy environment is perceived to be ""endemic,"" voters will reward ""responsible"" (competent) incumbents (i.e., ""output legitimacy""). Therefore, voters will tend to focus on inputs in systemically constrained contexts and outcomes in more unconstrained policy environments.	Formal Models

Since these survey data rely on samples drawn from commercial opt-in online panels with self-selected respondents, it is often questioned whether research based on such survey samples yields comparable results to research based on probability-based surveys. These rely on a random selection of respondents. This study compares a nonprobability and probability sample to answer the question of whether results from both samples are comparable in the analysis of voting behavior.We use two surveys - a nonprobability and a probability sample survey - of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) fielded prior to the German federal election 2017. We compare the two samples (1), regarding estimates' accuracy of characteristics with available external population benchmarks (e.g. turnout); (2), regarding their distribution in a set of over 100 variables, covering a large range of measures of political attitudes and behavior (e.g.polint) and (3), concerning differences in multivariate analyses through a multimodel comparison with voting intention as dependent variable.We show that (1) the probability-based survey sample performs slightly better for estimating characteristics with available external benchmarks. Concerning the (2) comparison of distributions and the (3) multivariate comparisons, we find no conclusive evidence for the type of sample affecting variables' distributions, the model´s goodness of fit and their main effects.This study provides new insights into the usage of nonprobability survey samples for studying voting behavior and exceeds previous research by applying a multimodel comparison and thus quantifying differences between probability and nonprobability survey samples.

Why is it so difficult to politically address rising wealth inequality? To help answer this question we study preferences over inheritance taxation using an original survey from England and Wales. We argue that it is difficult to tax inheritances for two reasons. First, many people don't have strong preferences regarding inheritance taxation, and the people who do, are more likely to come from higher socio-economic groups. There is thus a paradox in that the people who would stand to gain the most from taxing inheritances are those least likely to have an opinion on it. Second, rising house prices mean that more people expect to pass on larger inheritances to their children and that more people expect to inherit larger estates, putting downward pressure on inheritance taxes. Using non-experimental and experimental methods, we show that homeowners with more expensive houses, and people whose parents own more expensive properties, are less supportive of inheritance taxation. After empirically demonstrating our argument, we examine what happens when we randomly inform people about the level of wealth inequality locally and/or nationally. We find that our information treatment does not alter peoples’ preferences: preferences over inheritance taxation appear sticky, making it difficult to mobilize political support to address rising wealth inequality. The paper helps explain why addressing rising wealth inequality is politically difficult and thereby contributes to an increasingly salient debate.	European Politics

Moving beyond the analysis of affective polarization along partisan lines, this paper focuses on the hostility between social groups and how it is affected by economic inequality. Based on social identity theory, we advance two conflicting theoretical arguments: On the one hand, since inequality diminishes the material status of the lower socioeconomic classes, political economists hypothesize that rising levels of economic inequality will decrease the class identity among the poor. Based on this, we argue that inequality should mitigate the perceived group conflict between the rich and the poor and affective polarization between these social groups should decrease. On the other hand, psychological theories of class conflict assume that inequality accentuates perceptions of individual economic positions, leading to a more pronounced class identification among both low- and high-income people. From this, we argue that resentment and animosity towards the out-group will increase and that affective polarization between the rich and the poor will intensify.Using data from the International Social Survey we empirically test these competing hypotheses for 10 European countries over a period of more than 25 years. We contribute to the literature by showing the extent of affective polarization between social classes. Second, we will demonstrate whether economic inequality fosters this hostility between people with different social status, thereby undermining mutual respect and dialogue, which are some of the cornerstones of well-functioning democracies.

Combining novel data on the evolution of income to existing micro- and macro-level datasets, we argue that stagnation leads to greater support for spending cuts and tax cuts. We develop a simple model linking income stagnation to support for cuts via three distinct mechanisms. Stagnation reduces altruistic motives for welfare state spending, it heightens the relative perceived costs of insurance, and it leads individuals to support tax cuts to compensate for their stagnating incomes. Our micro-level empirical analyses show that individuals facing stagnant or lower incomes support spending cuts and tax cuts to a greater extent. This effect is especially strong among high-income individuals and/or people facing low unemployment risk. At the macro level, these dynamics lead to greater retrenchment in countries with lower income growth. Taken together, our findings link the literature on income stagnation to comparative political economy studies of changing welfare states. They help us make sense of why governments implement (often) economically inefficient spending cuts during economic crises, despite rising risks which should lead to larger welfare states. In contrast to previous literature claiming that the implementation of austerity is the result of democracy being subverted, we show that there are rationally based reasons why some pivotal electoral groups may support retrenchment under conditions of economic stagnation.

Moving beyond the analysis of affective polarization along partisan lines, this paper focuses on the hostility between social groups and how it is affected by economic inequality. Based on social identity theory, we advance two conflicting theoretical arguments: On the one hand, since inequality diminishes the material status of the lower socioeconomic classes, political economists hypothesize that rising levels of economic inequality will decrease the class identity among the poor. Based on this, we argue that inequality should mitigate the perceived group conflict between the rich and the poor and affective polarization between these social groups should decrease. On the other hand, psychological theories of class conflict assume that inequality accentuates perceptions of individual economic positions, leading to a more pronounced class identification among both low- and high-income people. From this, we argue that resentment and animosity towards the out-group will increase and that affective polarization between the rich and the poor will intensify.Using data from the International Social Survey we empirically test these competing hypotheses for 10 European countries over a period of more than 25 years. We contribute to the literature by showing the extent of affective polarization between social classes. Second, we will demonstrate whether economic inequality fosters this hostility between people with different social status, thereby undermining mutual respect and dialogue, which are some of the cornerstones of well-functioning democracies.

Explaining individual variations in the deservingness perceptions of social groups	486	The relevance of “deservingness perceptions” is well established in research on public opinion towards social policy with typical hierarchies of groups widely perceived to be more (the elderly, families), less (the poor, the unemployed), or least deserving (immigrants). Previous studies often assumed this hierarchy to be stable, resulting in considerable inequalities in groups’ prospects of obtaining beneficial policy. Yet, we know surprisingly little about whether and how perceptions of groups’ deservingness vary at the individual level. How homogeneous are citizens’ deservingness perceptions?

Thus, we argue that most variance occurs at the individual level, resulting in perceptions that are much more contested than the literature tends to claim.We rely on data gained through an online-survey conducted shortly before the 2021 legislative elections in Germany (N = 5,600). By studying deservingness perceptions for 16 selected groups, we extend previous research that has often focused on only a limited number of “needy” groups, leaving aside relevant targets of public policy such as entrepreneurs, workers or the rich. The main finding of this study that social images of groups are much more complex and heterogeneous, than previously suggested, has crucial implications for our understanding of social dynamics, the voter-party-relation and (unequal) policy responsiveness.

Why is it so difficult to politically address rising wealth inequality? To help answer this question we study preferences over inheritance taxation using an original survey from England and Wales. We argue that it is difficult to tax inheritances for two reasons. First, many people don't have strong preferences regarding inheritance taxation, and the people who do, are more likely to come from higher socio-economic groups. There is thus a paradox in that the people who would stand to gain the most from taxing inheritances are those least likely to have an opinion on it. Second, rising house prices mean that more people expect to pass on larger inheritances to their children and that more people expect to inherit larger estates, putting downward pressure on inheritance taxes. Using non-experimental and experimental methods, we show that homeowners with more expensive houses, and people whose parents own more expensive properties, are less supportive of inheritance taxation. After empirically demonstrating our argument, we examine what happens when we randomly inform people about the level of wealth inequality locally and/or nationally. We find that our information treatment does not alter peoples’ preferences: preferences over inheritance taxation appear sticky, making it difficult to mobilize political support to address rising wealth inequality. The paper helps explain why addressing rising wealth inequality is politically difficult and thereby contributes to an increasingly salient debate.	European Politics

Assessing the impact of deservingness attributions on European solidarity in a cross-national survey	506	In July 2020, EU member state governments agreed on a debt-financed 750 billion Euro recovery instrument to react on the pandemic crisis, a historical new. The policy found wide-spread support among Europeans. European solidarity is not dead, after all. I argue that the pandemic differs from previous crises in that it didn't allow for blame games.From the welfare state literature, we know that people assess the deservingness of other societal groups - the unemployed, the old, the sick - and condition their willingness to show solidarity accordingly. Existing research remains however limited on the effect of cross-border deservingness attributions. In a context of European fiscal solidarity, people would have to estimate the deservingness of whole countries and its political leadership, rather than a societal group.This paper examines whether and how individuals’ deservingness attributions of other EU countries (and their political leadership) affect their willingness to show European fiscal solidarity. Using survey data in ten EU countries from REScEU (Ferrera et al., 2019) and applying multilevel regression analysis, I show that deservingness attributions do explain attitudes on European fiscal solidarity.

Combining novel data on the evolution of income to existing micro- and macro-level datasets, we argue that stagnation leads to greater support for spending cuts and tax cuts. We develop a simple model linking income stagnation to support for cuts via three distinct mechanisms. Stagnation reduces altruistic motives for welfare state spending, it heightens the relative perceived costs of insurance, and it leads individuals to support tax cuts to compensate for their stagnating incomes. Our micro-level empirical analyses show that individuals facing stagnant or lower incomes support spending cuts and tax cuts to a greater extent. This effect is especially strong among high-income individuals and/or people facing low unemployment risk. At the macro level, these dynamics lead to greater retrenchment in countries with lower income growth. Taken together, our findings link the literature on income stagnation to comparative political economy studies of changing welfare states. They help us make sense of why governments implement (often) economically inefficient spending cuts during economic crises, despite rising risks which should lead to larger welfare states. In contrast to previous literature claiming that the implementation of austerity is the result of democracy being subverted, we show that there are rationally based reasons why some pivotal electoral groups may support retrenchment under conditions of economic stagnation.

Moreover, less attention has been paid to the relationship between leaders and the effect they have on allocating women to top positions. The paper evaluates, therefore, whether party leaders select women as a less risky strategy to reduce the probability of losing their party leadership in the future. This is because party leaders perceive women as less ambitious and more collaborative. To test these arguments, I conducted a vignette experiment in an original survey of around 1,000 Spanish mayors. Because mayors have the power to appoint governments, they are asked to select a team member between two randomly-varied profiles of would-be politicians. The research also explores whether age, level of education, and having children influence team selection; as well as if male or female stereotypes (i.e., being described as competitive and self-confident, or kind and conciliatory) influence political advancement. In all, the experimental data confirms that gender, having children, and stereotypes influence teams’ selection. The contribution of the paper is focused on exploring if there are some patterns that define female leaders’ pathways to power. Specifically, the paper contributes to the understanding of the effects of intraparty leadership selection mechanisms, with special attention to party leaders’ motivations and incentives of appointing women on their teams.

Gender Stereotypes in Members of Parliament Twitter self-presentation	1167	Literature has struggled to show how the substantive representation of women occurs in different political areas. While, in the last decade, scholarly attention has been relevantly redirected to gender differences in locus of power, analyses of women performance on social media are rather scarce. This lack of research is especially flagrant if considering that social media are increasingly the central stage in the development of political action. We here seek to fill this gap by exploring if female politicians behave differently from male ones on Twitter, if there exist any variation among the former group, and moreover, if this behaviour is anyhow connected to their offline roles and activity. Particularly, by focusing on Spain’s current legislature term, in this paper we aim to examine to what extent female and male MPs differ regarding their self-presentation strategies. Accordingly, we focus on Twitter bios as a novel source of information about users' interests and identities. Our results suggest that female MPs' bios are significantly different from male ones.

Extant research documents the importance of institutions, women’s groups and community for early women's turnout. However, data limitations prevent scholars to provide robust evidence for theorized household effects. The conventional wisdom, later coined by Duverger (1953), suggests that women's restricted access to labour force and education generated an informational asymmetry within the household, which then increased the importance of intra-marital mobilization for women. However, the conventional wisdom has not been subject to rigorous tests, primarily reflecting lack of suitable data in the pre-survey times. Exploiting unique individual level turnout data from electoral registers in selected Swedish cities after women’s suffrage, and estimating a difference-in-difference model, we provide evidence that intra-marital mobilization was equally important for women and men. These findings are a rebuttal to historical accounts that emphasize a husband’s ability to mobilize newly enfranchised wife over a wife’s ability to mobilize their husband.

Underlying this gender gap in political participation, however, is a striking and unanswered puzzle: across rural India, women show up to vote on election days at high rates, almost equal to those of men, but in between elections women remain markedly less present in political spaces, both relative to men and relative to their rates of votingWhy do women vote but not participate in politics otherwise? I argue that the explanation for this puzzling fact lies in the structure of political networks and women’s agency. Drawing on network data from a complete census of adults in two villages in Madhya Pradesh and in-depth interviews with 40 men and women, I show that women’s political networks are rooted in the household, and women’s political behavior is jointly determined by their household. Women vote not only because theywant to but because it provides a benefit to those with power in their households. I then link the structure of men’s and women’s political networks to their political participation and show that the size of women’s political networks, specifically the size of their networks outside of their household, correlates with their non-electoral political participation. Women’s political participation can only be understood by understanding the nature of influence and coercion in their political networks.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Gender Stereotypes in Members of Parliament Twitter self-presentation	1167	Literature has struggled to show how the substantive representation of women occurs in different political areas. While, in the last decade, scholarly attention has been relevantly redirected to gender differences in locus of power, analyses of women performance on social media are rather scarce. This lack of research is especially flagrant if considering that social media are increasingly the central stage in the development of political action. We here seek to fill this gap by exploring if female politicians behave differently from male ones on Twitter, if there exist any variation among the former group, and moreover, if this behaviour is anyhow connected to their offline roles and activity. Particularly, by focusing on Spain’s current legislature term, in this paper we aim to examine to what extent female and male MPs differ regarding their self-presentation strategies. Accordingly, we focus on Twitter bios as a novel source of information about users' interests and identities. Our results suggest that female MPs' bios are significantly different from male ones. In fact, we demonstrate that the similarity in the bio content can be used to predict the gender of the MP.	Gender Politics and Diversity

However, in other cases, such as that of the Greek Golden Dawn (GD) party, it’s clear that harsh government measures can be effective and lead to party collapse. Embedded within this puzzle is our limited knowledge on how targeted FR parties react to such measures. One effective narrative at their disposal is that of “playing the victim” against an “undemocratic” attack from the government. Such rhetorical devices are particularly dangerous, as they can increase hostility towards outgroups and whip-up support for political violence. We argue that victimhood claims also help increase FR party cohesion and voter loyalty and thus may be used strategically by a targeted FR party. This paper focuses on the case of the GD party and tests whether its official communication adopted more victimhood narrative claims following its sanctioning in 2017, while using its Cypriot “sister-party” ELAM—which did not experience a government crackdown—as a comparison case. We gather thousands of official party news articles and combine supervised machine-learning approaches to detect and classify the use of victimhood narratives by both parties and assess how their usage evolves over time. We expect that as a government cracks down on a party there will be an increase in party victimhood claims that will also correlate with a rise in general claims of national victimhood.

While we know that the content of right-wing alternative media is associated with the rise of right-wing populists, islamophobia, and political polarization (Holt, 2019), little is known about the audience of right-wing news media. Previous studies find that alternative news use is connected to low levels of trust in and a tendency to avoid traditional news media (Newman & Kalogeropulos, 2018; Tsfati & Cappella, 2003). The ongoing debate concerning fragmentation of audiences suggests tendencies of news use polarization and stresses the need to focus on political fringes when studying fragmentation dynamics (Mahrt, 2020). Our research question therefore is: How are the news media repertoires of users of right-wing alternative news websites characterized and do we detect fragmentation tendencies studying the users' overall news diets? The presumption is that alternative news media consumption could lead to recipients turning away from traditional news sources.We address the RQ via audience overlap networks (Webster & Ksiazek, 2012) using the Reuters Digital News Survey (RDNS) 2020. The RDNS surveys the usage of specific news brands, including offline and online as well as traditional and alternative news sources. We employ a cross-national design, including Austria, Germany, Sweden, Norway. The analyses will extend our understanding of alternative news audiences and their media consumption behaviour. We will be able to detect the presence or absence of fragmentation tendencies, and thus possibly polarization of alternative news audiences.	Political Communication

To what extend can women in influential positions such as head of fraction, party leader, or president of parliament contribute to a more gender equal legislature? Certain positions in parliament are critical and allow actors to change and revise existing power dynamics. If women are critical actors promoting women’s advancement into politics, women’s presence in these positions should narrow gender difference in legislative behavior. In this study, I analyze time-series-cross-sectional data from German states to investigate whether gender differences in committee assignment and debate participation narrow when women occupy critical positions. The findings of this research have important implications for efforts to reach gender parity as well as for the functioning of parliamentary democracy more broadly.	Parties and Representation

Despite notable exceptions where judicial decisions have transformed LGBT+ rights, in most established democracies, parliamentary action is a necessary prerequisite for LGBT+ rights advances. We have very little evidence, however, about what drives parliamentary success on LGBT+ rights laws: are legislators updating their preferences (conversion thesis) or is the entry of new legislators with more socially liberal policy preferences driving the change (replacement thesis)? In this paper, we test both the “conversion” and “replacement” hypotheses using a unique database of over 3000 members of parliaments across four countries with different electoral systems across four different policy areas related to LGBT+ rights. Initial findings show that incumbent members of parliament rarely change their voting behavior. Instead, legislative progress occurs via parliamentary cohort replacement which coincides with broader shifts in public opinion. However, we only find this effect among parliamentarians on the center-left of the political spectrum. Our findings not only have important implications for understanding the conditions for the advancement of LGBT+ legislation, but also contributes to the growing literature on if and why incumbent politicians’ actions are in line with their constituents demands, a key feature of any democracy.

When parties cooperate, they are perceived as closer together in an ideological space than when they compete. So far, this mechanism has only been tested at the national level and researchers have largely disregarded the complex interaction between parties competing and cooperating at various levels of a federal state. A German citizen is continuously exposed to different coalitions in her own state, in neighbouring states, and at the federal level. In this paper we argue that this complex multi-level system should have an influence on the perception of voters, especially for coalition parties. More specifically, we hypothesize that voters will perceive those national parties as closer to each other on a left-right scale that are in government in their state even though they are not members of the same coalition at the national level. We test our hypothesis by relying on the GLES 2016-2020 panel study. By doing so, we will not only analyse how regional government participation influences the perception of parties at the national level but also test what kind of consequences change in government participation at the regional level has for this perception. Our results will have important implications for the consequences of government participation in complex multi-level systems.	Parties and Representation

Do perceptions of support parties shift with governing coalition partners?	316	Research has demonstrated that voters use a coalition heuristic in their perceptions of party policy shifts: Junior coalition partners are perceived to shift in parallel to Prime Minister parties. No such effect is found for opposition parties. Several mechanisms account for this: (a) Voters recognize that coalition partners are pressured to compromise over policy, (b) parties of similar positions often form governing coalitions, (c) parties in coalition are less likely to differentiate themselves in public during the legislative term, (d) coalition parties work jointly though legislative and government institutions in policy-making and implementation. The role of ‘support’ parties, has not yet been examined, and political scientists know little of how voters perceive these parties. These parties publicly commit to side with the government on votes of confidence and other major pieces of legislation, yet are not formally represented in cabinet. All four mechanisms mentioned above should also apply to support parties even though they officially remain outside the formal coalition. Drawing on data from over 20 Eastern and Western European countries with coalition governments, we document to what extent the coalition heuristic applies to support parties, and whether voters perceive their shifts as similar to coalition partners in tracking the prime minister. We also argue, and test, that support parties’ ability to maintain a distinctive image is conditioned on how formalized its agreement is with the governing coalition. Our results have important implications for electoral competition and government formation.	Parties and Representation

The Reputational Cost of Political Compromise	242	Effective policy-making requires parties to accept political compromise, yet doing so likely affects their reputation. Political parties thus face a trade-off between responsibility and responsiveness. Responsibility calls for parties to broker compromises, while responsiveness requires parties to adhere to their original policy positions. Previous research has shown that voters adjust their perceptions of parties in response to compromise and party policy change. It is not clear, however, how voter perceptions of compromise affect political trust and credibility. We address this question with two pre-registered studies. With an observational study of 6 Western European countries (Study 1), we show that rejection of compromise coincides with lower levels of trust in political parties. To examine more closely whether responsive or responsible party behaviour in coalition negotiations is decisive for voters’ party evaluations, we conduct survey experiment in Germany (N=7000) fielded just after the 2021 parliamentary elections (Study 2). Using simulated Instagram party messages as treatments, we 1) isolate the effect of parties’ negotiation position from success or failure in the negotiations; and 2) delve into the psychological determinants that drive voters’ party trust after (not) accepting compromises. We find that parties’ steadfast positioning (i.e. rejecting compromise) in coalition talks leads to higher evaluations of party trust, credibility, and representational quality. Further, we find that respondents’ psychological traits of being principled and high social distrust negatively affect their acceptance of party compromise. Our study has important implications for the study of political representation by shedding light on the reputational costs of political compromise.	Parties and Representation

Most works show that citizens are more likely to follow party cues and adjust their issue opinions. However, we know less about to what extent partisans follow their party and who among the partisans do so. Given the prevalence of increasing polarization in the Western democracies, I aim to answer the following question: When a political party takes a more extreme ideological stance, do party supporters follow by taking more polarized stances? I theorize that whether a partisan follows the party depends on (1) the extent to which she perceives the party’s shift and (2) her spatial location relative to the party. To test these expectations, I exploit a real-world sudden party polarization after a leadership change in the Labour Party of the United Kingdom in 2015 that shifted the party’s position to further left. Using British Election Study Internet Panel data, I find that Labour partisans become more left-wing. However, this is not the case for all Labour partisans. First, the more they perceive the party to have shifted to left, the more left-wing position they adopt. Second, only those that are located on the right of the party after the latter has moved further left follow the party. Furthermore, this effect is not short-lived and persists through 2017 and 2019 General Elections. These results provide insight into the conditional role of party identification in opinion formation, which has consequences for democratic representation.	Parties and Representation

The legal literature’s approach to testing hypotheses of judicial bias has been to present bivariate cross-tabulations of ethnicity and trial outcomes among indictees (Ford 2013; Vajda et al 2019). We explain how sample censoring and confounding bias this approach, and we introduce an alternative recently applied in the study of racial bias in police stops (Knox, Lowe, and Mummolo 2020). We present nonparametric bounds on the treatment effects of ethnicity-related variables on trial outcomes under all plausible assumptions about prosecutorial bias, while using new data to adjust for relevant confounds. Whereas naive analyses of our data suggest that the ICTY-IRMCT trial chambers treated all defendants equally, our partially identified estimates suggest an important exception: Bosnian Serbs. We show that, under reasonable assumptions of prosecutorial “bias” arising from practical constraints on arrest and surrenders from 1995-present, a defendant’s allegiance to Bosnian Serb interests raised their probability of conviction and increased their sentence duration.

When Russia declared itself a legal and political successor to all USSR’s obligations, the global configuration of powers had already shifted, so it had to reconfigure. This paper provides an overview of the dynamics of how Russia took its position in relating to its usage of references to international law/international standards and arguments of international law in terms of its foreign policymaking. In particular, this paper addresses the issue of how internal political fluctuations in Russia during the 1990s and 2000s affected its foreign ventures. Specifically, this paper looks into how, when, and if international laws established in the post-1990 period were used or abused in terms of forwarding Russia’s own foreign policy activities and whether this maneuvering triggered any changes to the global political game in any respect.

I argue that temporal considerations are important, with arms transfers solving a critical problem arising from shaky third party commitments. If a protege is worried that it will be abandoned by a friendly third party in the future, it may initiate a preventive strike in the present to capitalize on the benefits of direct military support. Thus, unstable security relationships result in war because they give rise to a dynamic commitment problem. Arms transfers act as a substitute for the expectation of direct military support. As a result, arms reduce a protege's reliance, and soften the blow of expected abandonment. Consequently, they eliminate the incentive for entrapment and result in peace. To illustrate this, I develop a formal model in which a defender, protege, and challenger interact repeatedly over time. When the defender's future commitment to the protege'e is stable, arms transfers are not necessary. However, when the defender's commitment is likely to wane, arms transfers may occur in equilibrium, as they prevent the protege from initiating a war of entrapment.	Formal Models

They can try to limit the enemy's ability to benefit from future attacks (""deterrence by denial""), or punish the enemy ex post (""deterrence by punishment""). These two canonical approaches to deterrence present different challenges and are an alyzed often separately. In this paper we build a game theoretic model that brings together the two approaches and highlights an unintended consequence of investing in denial capabilities. Previous work has argued that deterrence by denial suffers from low perceived capability (to stop attacks) while punishment strategies suffer from low perceived willingness (to retaliate). Our main contribution is to show that efforts to correct the former problem may end up exacerbating the latter. Specifically, investing in denial capabilities may actually signal to enemies a lack of resolve to punish transgressions. The reason is, for unresolved leaders, the only hope of deterring future attacks is to bolster their denial capabilities enough to reduce the benefit of an attack. We show that when investment in denial produces uncertain returns, this may lower one's credibility and prove to be a self-defeating strategy. Our results improve our ability to explain the behavior of deterring countries and to account for the empirical regularities on det errence failures.	Formal Models

Providing a clear and reliable answer to this empirical question has proved particularly difficult, given the insurmountable challenge posed by the selection problems that permeate the empirical study of sanctions. Additionally, scholars have often studied sanctions in isolation, without treating them as one alternative within the toolkit of foreign polic ies a country can adopt. To sidestep these issues, we build a game theoretic model to study how sanctions interact with military interventions within the context of a deterrence game. We show how sanctions can act as complements or substitutes for military intervention in the quest for deterrence. By building a benchmark model where the possibility of imposing sanctions is not present, we can assess the actual effect of sanctions on transgressions from target countries. We show when sanctions make deterrence via the threat of military intervention possible, and when instead the existence of a deterrence effect inhibits the effectiveness of sanctions in preventing or reducing the severity of transgressions.

They can try to limit the enemy's ability to benefit from future attacks (""deterrence by denial""), or punish the enemy ex post (""deterrence by punishment""). These two canonical approaches to deterrence present different challenges and are an alyzed often separately. In this paper we build a game theoretic model that brings together the two approaches and highlights an unintended consequence of investing in denial capabilities. Previous work has argued that deterrence by denial suffers from low perceived capability (to stop attacks) while punishment strategies suffer from low perceived willingness (to retaliate). Our main contribution is to show that efforts to correct the former problem may end up exacerbating the latter. Specifically, investing in denial capabilities may actually signal to enemies a lack of resolve to punish transgressions. The reason is, for unresolved leaders, the only hope of deterring future attacks is to bolster their denial capabilities enough to reduce the benefit of an attack. We show that when investment in denial produces uncertain returns, this may lower one's credibility and prove to be a self-defeating strategy. Our results improve our ability to explain the behavior of deterring countries and to account for the empirical regularities on det errence failures.	Formal Models

The novelty here is that the threat of nuclear escalation comes about inadvertently, making it a function of conflict duration with a non-monotonic relationship to conventional capabilities. When two states have similar conventional capabilities and enter into a war, the conventional conflict will be prolonged, thus resulting in high degrees of nuclear risk. When two states have dissimilar conventional capabilities, conventional conflict will be one-sided and short, thus resulting in low degrees of nuclear risk. The model generates a series of results, including evidence of the nuclear peace, of conflict patterns consistent with the stability-instability paradox, and of the merits of ``burning bridges.’’ Additionally, the model generates mixed results on the feasibility of using catastrophic nuclear risk as a substitute for conventional arming.

Providing a clear and reliable answer to this empirical question has proved particularly difficult, given the insurmountable challenge posed by the selection problems that permeate the empirical study of sanctions. Additionally, scholars have often studied sanctions in isolation, without treating them as one alternative within the toolkit of foreign polic ies a country can adopt. To sidestep these issues, we build a game theoretic model to study how sanctions interact with military interventions within the context of a deterrence game. We show how sanctions can act as complements or substitutes for military intervention in the quest for deterrence. By building a benchmark model where the possibility of imposing sanctions is not present, we can assess the actual effect of sanctions on transgressions from target countries. We show when sanctions make deterrence via the threat of military intervention possible, and when instead the existence of a deterrence effect inhibits the effectiveness of sanctions in preventing or reducing the severity of transgressions.

Therefore, populist actors aim to be closer to the ‘ordinary’ citizens and act in their will. One strategy of populist actors is to simplify political problems. This can be achieved through oversimplification of complex problems, but also through using simpler language. Current studies are divided whether populist actors actually use simpler language in their rhetorical strategies or not. Thus, there is much theoretical and anecdotal evidence about the simplification of populist rhetoric. Also, quantitative evidence has been provided presenting, however, mixed results. This paper aims to shed light on these contradictory results by looking at parliamentary debates in Germany. Analysing a huge text corpus of parliamentary debates from March 1991 to December 2018 this research paper aims to answer the following research questions: Do populist actors use simpler language than other political actors in parliamentary debates? And to what extend does simple language transmit between political actors leading to overall more simplified parliamentary debates? To answer the research questions quantitative text analysis strategies are employed using different measures of language complexity and political sophistication. The paper poses the hypothesis that populist actors use indeed simpler language than other actors following their ideal of a simplified world between ‘good’ and ‘evil’. Also, it argues that simple language transmits from populist actors towards mainstream actors if their debates are held in timely close manner.	Legislative Studies

Some point to a blurring of government and opposition (Andeweg 2013), while others find that parliamentary (voting) behaviour remains structured to a high degree by the distinction between governing and opposition parties (Hix & Noury 2016; Loxbo & Sjölin, 2017). Most existing work concerns single-country analysis often for limited time frames. This paper contributes to this debate by analyzing government-opposition distinctiveness in four parliamentary democracies (Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, United Kingdom) over a long time span (1945-2020).The expectation of a long-term decline of government-opposition distinctiveness is related to increasing levels of party system fragmentation and minority governance, especially in countries with more proportional electoral systems. Decreasing patterns of distinctiveness are expected most clearly among parties with prior governing experience, while challenger parties are expected to behave distinctively.The country selection offers a diverse set of countries in terms of electoral rules as well as the occurrence of minority governments. In each country, we analyse patterns of parliamentary voting behaviour, in particular opposition party support for government bill, as well as speech making, in particular opposition sentiment. The data collection is based on combining various existing sources of parliamentary data, appended by original data scraping and processing of parliamentary data sources. By comparing these two very different aspects of parliamentary behaviour, we can examine the extent to which there is a difference between distinctiveness in rhetoric and in voting behaviour.

If this choice is to be meaningful, opposition parties must behave distinctively from governing parties in parliament. However, previous studies found high levels of consensus in the law-making process between governing and opposition parties in European parliamentary democracies. Our understanding of when and why opposition parties support or oppose the government is surprisingly sketchy. This paper examines the factors that drive the extent to which opposition parties distinguish themselves from the government.Existing studies have mostly focused on parliamentary votes within a limited time frame in one or two countries. This paper will analyse both parliamentary votes and parliamentary speeches in long time spans (approximately 70 years) in four countries with very different political systems: the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Canada.Policy concerns are expected to motivate opposition parties to support the government, e.g. when their policy preferences are similar or when the government accommodates wishes from opposition parties with veto power. However, electoral incentives are expected to drive opposition parties to signal their distinctive position to voters by opposing the government; these arise when opposition parties feel monitored by voters, e.g. when voters are volatile or when the issue at hand is salient. Additionally, the prospect of wholesaly replacing the incumbent government after future elections is also expected to increase opposition parties’ distinctiveness from the government.

At the same time, existing research in public opinion has repeatedly pointed to the crucial role of institutions for the level of democratic consent among winners and losers at the citizen level. In this research, however, the legislature has not figured prominently among the institutional determinants of satisfaction with democracy. In this paper, I bring these two literatures together and analyze the effect of legislative rules on the satisfaction with democracy MPs express. I analyze the power attributed to opposition MPs and parties during the policy-making process and its link to satisfaction with democracy of government and opposition MPs. By focusing on legislatures – the institutions where losers of democratic elections are represented – I present a more direct link between institutional organization and satisfaction with democracy of these losers at the elite level. Results from logistic multi-level models show that the way parliaments are organized does influence the individual level of satisfaction with democracy among representatives. More power of opposition parties enhances the satisfaction of opposition MPs but does not necessarily reduce that of government representatives.	Legislative Studies

In July 2021 the UK government proposed a sweeping statute of limitations to all offences related to the Northern Ireland conflict. The UK government is accused of drawing an arbitrary line under the Northern Ireland conflict and sweeping aside the concerns of victims and their families. Engaging recent historical prosecutions and the proposed military amnesty, this panel looks at the role that military amnesty plays in maintaining necropolitical organizations. Specifically, we discuss the ways in which such amnesty works to reaffirm antagonistic relations between peacebuilding parties despite claims that it is a reconciliatory measure. Using the case study of the British Army in Northern Ireland, we consider historical approaches to military prosecutions by the UK state alongside current proposals for amnesty over all homicides committed in Northern Ireland prior to the 1998 Good Friday agreement through a necropolitical lens. We interrogate the ways in which these calls for amnesty remain under the same necropolitical organization that facilitated the Troubles to begin with and maintain narratives that Other Northern Ireland from Britain.

Yet contemporary scholarship on civil wars as well as attentive readings of first-hand accounts of counterinsurgent forces in Iraq and Afghanistan reveal that another neglected but real challenge is the Positional Problem. Given that individual civilians and fighters as well as civilian populations and armed groups switch sides over time, the civil-war landscape resembles less of a bipolar struggle between two static sides and more as a contest between ever-changing alliance formations at multiple levels. Given these kaleidoscophic dynamics, counterinsurgents must decide how best to position their forces to accomplish their political leaders' aims; however, counterinsurgent leaders are not trained to resolve these positional problems. This argument has implications for just-war theory, military education, and civil-military relations.	International Relations and Conflict

However, these explanations have not been tested systematically. To fill this gap, I first introduce a new dataset that covers the universe of political apologies in the context of armed conflict. Then, I conduct empirical investigations to find out which theoretical explanations matter for an apology. I complement my quantitative analyses with two qualitative ones. First, I conduct an expert interview with a political leader who issued an apology. Second, I offer in-depth case studies. My results from the statistical analyses reveal that political apologies depend on the number of armed groups in a conflict and regime type. I follow up on these results with the interview and the case-studies to show the processes and mechanisms related to a state’s calculus for apologising.	International Relations and Conflict

Despite calls for adequate compensation of those affected by economic shocks, the electoral payoff of this compensatory strategy is unclear. Amid the current globalization backlash, we study the impact of a novel compensatory mechanism set up by the European Union: the European Globalization Adjustment Fund (EGF). By going beyond the American context, we offer a systematic evaluation of whether compensating the losers of globalization pays off electorally through the first assessment of the EGF’s impact on voting behavior.We theorize that, if EGF is consequential, incumbents should be punished less, populists should receive less support and turnout should be higher in regions that applied to the Fund compared to regions that were eligible but did not apply. To evaluate these hypotheses, we build an original panel dataset for 20 European Union countries connecting more than 25,000 localized labor market shocks in the European Union since 2002 with subnational results in legislative and European elections and details about EGF applications. In European elections, we find that a successful EGF application decreased turnout and boosted incumbents when the Fund request was made in the pre-election year. We also find that in regions that successfully applied for compensation, populist parties tended to lose support in the next European elections. However, EGF funding has a limited impact in legislative elections, a conclusion confirmed with individual-level analyses based on the European Social Survey.	Political Economy

We find that commercial reorientation toward the EU is associated with higher levels of redistribution in Central and Eastern Europe, which implies that CEE policymakers combined trade reorganization with compensation for the losers of globalization. Similarly, higher emigration and personal remittances are related to greater efforts to alleviate income inequality. In contrast, adoption of the euro generally induces lower redistribution. Interestingly, the receipt of EU cohesion funds does not have an effect on income differentials in the region.

But when business interests and voter preferences diverge, which side do they listen to? We argue that this depends on legislators’ ideology and the economic structure of the districts that legislators represent.

Yet on election day they often seem to ignore that dislike and vote for corrupt politicians. Whereas previous scholarship has identified that information and care about corruption affects whether voters vote for corrupt politicians or not, we develop a new theory showing how and why a combination of dislike, knowledge and care shapes the role corruption plays in parliamentary elections. We test our hypotheses on Bulgaria, a country that not only has suffered from widespread corruption at all levels of government from the local to the national level but had a blend of both proven corrupt and convincingly clean parties running for office in the 2021 elections. Using a specially commissioned survey from Bulgaria’s leading polling agency Alpha (1000 respondents randomly selected across Bulgaria in July 2021), we find that voters that dislike corruption, identify a party as corrupt, and care about corruption have a significantly lower likelihood of voting for a corrupt party. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the more voters take corruption into account when voting, the more likely they are to vote for clean parties such as “There is such people” and the less likely they are to vote for corrupt parties. To understand fully the role of corruption in elections, we need to look at information about, dislike of and care for corruption.

Evidence from Malaysia	837	What is the fate of firms connected to authoritarian regimes when the government falls from power? Recent studies show that firms’ political connections tend to trump their private benefit, yet we know little about whether a positive return is warranted when a firms’ patron is ousted. Using an original dataset on Malaysian firms, we employ weighted fixed-effect analysis to explain why and how the opposition’s historic electoral victory in 2018 affected politically connected firms’ financial performance. The findings suggest that firms connected to the ousted government improve 9.4% percentage points in returns in an additional year after elections. Further evidence reveals that these rents stem primarily from re-instituting the government’s practice of selective patronage, aimed at consolidating power at the expense of the former ruling party’s support bases. We find little evidence that formal policy influence or positive external perceptions enhance politically connected firms after power alternation.	Political Economy

Economic integration maintains the most sizeable impact with the maximum impact at 11 % of the scale of net political interest.Overall, Germans from Turkey and their children empirically show a clear picture that more integration into German society leads to higher general political interest and a profile of transnational political interest tilted more towards German politics.

Lindemann	Hertie School	p	y	0668	The Socialist Shadow: Immigrants and Regime Preference in an Experimental Online Game	727	Why are immigrants from former communist regimes less likely to support left-of-centre parties than other immigrants? The literature finds recurring empirical evidence for this pattern, but the mechanism underlying this behaviour remains largely unexplained. In this article, I test two theoretical approaches: Immigrants from former communist countries might have particularly high economic aspirations and believe that left-wing policies hinder their own economic success. Conversely, immigrants might turn against the political left due to resentments against parties with a similar ideology as the former communist dictator. To test these mechanisms, I conduct a blocked-randomised experimental online game. The two treatment settings simulate a socialist and capitalist economy to assess the preference for the corresponding regime. Participants are asked to complete tasks, which let them score points based on effort and skill. Depending on the treatment setting, the total points made in each group are either redistributed between all group members equally (socialist setting) or participants keep the score they have individually achieved (capitalist setting). Ideological bias appears if immigrants from communist regimes are less likely to favour the socialist rule system compared to other immigrants, even if they benefit from it. On the other hand, immigrant groups behaving equally across both treatment settings supports the considerations of economic aspirations. By conducting this experimental online game, I do not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of the effect of political socialisation in the case of immigrants, but also propose a novel approach on how to measure political preferences.

They do so primarily because they expect that the outgroup will be less likely to reciprocate cooperative behavior. Such ingroup bias points to a potential challenge in the production and maintenance of public goods in increasingly multiethnic societies. Yet, though the importance of expectations in cooperation is well established, we know very little as to why people expect the outgroup to be less cooperative than the ingroup. In this article, I argue that the ethnic majority expects ethnic minorities and immigrants to be less cooperative because ethnicity is (perceived to be) related to other social factors such as socio-economic status and norm compliance that in themselves a) predict cooperating behavior and b) reduce ethnic bias once knowledge of such factors is available. Hence, the expectation that ethnic outgroup members cooperate less is driven by the correlates of ethnicity more than ethnicity itself. To test these arguments, I conduct a conjoint experiment in Denmark in which respondents are asked to observe and predict the behavior of different players in a large-N public goods game (data is being collected). The experiment is novel in assigning each respondent to different types and amounts of player attributes that makes it possible to isolate both the direct and mediating effects of different social factors perceived to correlate with ethnicity. Investigating whether expectations of cooperation is based on ethnicity or ethnic stereotypes is important for policies aimed at improving cooperation in diverse societies.	Behaviour and Opinion

In this study, I shift focus to a crucial yet heretofore overlooked structural economic driver of resistance to immigration: economic inequality between natives. I construct a granular panel data set of local economic inequality in Germany. Drawing on tax registry data from more than 500 million individual-level tax returns filed between 1992 and 2017, I precisely estimate inequality at the municipal level. Using a difference in differences design, I compare the reaction of egalitarian and unequal communities to the sharp influx of refugees starting in 2015. I consider xenophobic backlash along four dimensions: i) right-wing voting, ii) hate crimes, iii) anti-immigration protests, and iv) petitions against immigration.	Behaviour and Opinion

In invoking the confidence procedure, however, leaders willingly jeopardize their job. To avoid replacement, they need to secure unanimity within their cabinet before calling the vote and the support of the majority of legislators voting on the motion. This begs the following questions: under what circumstances will PMs be more (or less) likely to initiate a confidence vote and how do these circumstances affect the prospects of success of the vote? This puzzle is non-trivial because these votes have been traditionally used for salient and -at times- controversial matters. In this article, I investigate how institutional features that shape the onerousness of governing affect the prime minister’s choice to employ this device and the outcome of the vote. There are factors that can make it harder (or easier) for the PM to obtain consensus from her ministers as well as parliament. I identify these factors as: the size of the coalition and its degree of heterogeneity, the share of the coalition controlled by the head of government, the size of the opposition, and the cabinet’s minority status. By relying on a novel dataset of PMICVs events, I outline different instances of use of confidence votes initiated by PMs and I present an empirical study of the determinants of their usage and success, the first of its kind.

Interethnic Coalitions and Government Stability	1041	Since the end of communism in Central Eastern Europe (CEE), the governments of the region’s new democracies have experienced high levels of turnover, particularly when compared to the more established democracies in the West. Yet, within CEE, there has been much variation in government duration. While studies have shown that government duration largely follows many expectations established in the literature on Western democracies, more recent work has shown that additional factors need to be accounted for to explain the variation in government stability in CEE. To better understand this variation, this paper investigates the role played by ethnic minority parties, important political players in the ethnically diverse countries in the region. Ethnic minority parties are unique from other parties in the region due to their loyal voter base that continues to support them after serving in government, despite routine punishment of other incumbents. Does the electoral stability of ethnic minority parties lead to greater stability of the coalitions that they join? This paper presents a quantitative test of hypotheses using a dataset of governments since the early 1990’s in ten CEE states. This study gives us insight into both the impact of ethnic diversity on government stability and the important role played by ethnic minority parties in the party systems in which they are present.

In this paper, I test existing theoretical models of government formation with new data on 520 parties at 380 formation opportunities in 25 European democracies between 1919 and 1939. The new dataset includes results from all 127 democratic elections in the interwar period, identifies parties’ ideological positions, their main supporting coalitions, and finally government participation. Theoretically, I argue that the interwar period was characterized by greater political polarization and greater uncertainty about party discipline than the decades after World War II. Thus, political elites found it harder to form governments, and wound up with unstable minority governments. Alternatively, governments attempted to protect themselves against defections by forming oversized coalitions. Using mixed logit models, I compare the logic of government formation in the interwar period to the post-World War II era. Initial findings suggest that minority governments and surplus coalitions were far more common between 1919 and 1939 than after 1945. Studying government formation across two periods is important for two reasons. First, expanding the empirical scope of government formation allows us to establish scope conditions for existing theories. Second, the emergence of populist and openly anti-democratic parties in recent years has transformed European party systems in ways similar to the interwar period. Conclusions from models of government formation built on the period 1945-2010 might simply no longer apply. In contrast, lessons from interwar Europe might become more relevant for contemporary political decision-makers.	Comparative Politics

Moving beyond the simplistic relationship between descriptive and substantive representation of women, we analyze whether various personality traits of politicians are associated with their policy position on women’s issues as well as their prioritization of this policy domain. Based on psychological research on the Big Five traits (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism), we theoretically expect politicians scoring high on Openness to Experience to take more liberal positions on social policies and therefore to be more likely to support and prioritize women’s issues. In contrast, conscientious politicians rather tend to adopt more conservative policy positions and consequently will not pay much attention to women’s interests. Moreover, we hypothesize that these effects are stronger for female than for male politicians. Using original data from a comparative survey of elite politicians in Germany and Switzerland, the results confirm our hypothesis about the positive effect of Openness to Experience on the priority that individual politicians assign to the representation of women’s issues. We do not find any significant effects for Conscientiousness.

However, authoritarian psychological dispositions may also affect people's perceptions of the judiciary.

While a large corpus of literature argues that descriptive representation is vital for substantive representation, empirical research largely focuses on analyzing voter preferences for individual candidate characteristics. I argue that such studies are ill-equipped for assessing voters' preferences for descriptive representation. Voters might favor being represented by, for example, a well-educated, mid-aged and politically experienced woman, but this does not necessarily indicate that voters want all legislators to look like that. I design a novel conjoint experiment in which respondents have to decide between two differently composed parliaments and use this design for testing theories about representation preferences. These findings provide a novel perspective on voter preferences for descriptive representation and provide empirical evidence regarding the question of which societal groups voters want to be accurately represented in parliament.

Moving beyond the simplistic relationship between descriptive and substantive representation of women, we analyze whether various personality traits of politicians are associated with their policy position on women’s issues as well as their prioritization of this policy domain. Based on psychological research on the Big Five traits (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism), we theoretically expect politicians scoring high on Openness to Experience to take more liberal positions on social policies and therefore to be more likely to support and prioritize women’s issues. In contrast, conscientious politicians rather tend to adopt more conservative policy positions and consequently will not pay much attention to women’s interests. Moreover, we hypothesize that these effects are stronger for female than for male politicians. Using original data from a comparative survey of elite politicians in Germany and Switzerland, the results confirm our hypothesis about the positive effect of Openness to Experience on the priority that individual politicians assign to the representation of women’s issues. We do not find any significant effects for Conscientiousness. These findings contribute to the study of women’s representation as well as to the booming literature on the effect of personality traits on politicians’ self-reported policy positions and preferences.

In this article, using a 12-wave panel dataset on Spaniards’ political attitudes and data from the Catalan Public Opinion institute (CEO), and based on literature on multidimensional political spaces and political polarization, we test two main arguments. First, that despite the capacity of the left-right dimension as an integrative “super-issue”, perceived polarization regarding other important cleavages can also lead to AP. Indeed, through linear panel models with fixed effects, we show that individual-level changes on perceived polarization regarding the territorial dimension produce individual-level changes on AP, independently of the left-right perceived polarization. Second, that the capacity of each dimension to lead to AP varies depending on individuals’ ideology. That is, the capacity of left-right and territorial polarization to lead to AP substantially differs according to the different ideological groups, highlighting the fact that distinct individuals can become affectively polarized for different reasons. Whereas left-wing individuals seem to primarily become affectively polarized when they perceive a recrudescence of left-right polarization, center and right-wing individuals do so when they perceive greater polarization regarding the national conflict. These results have potential implications for the understanding of the causes fueling AP in multinational democracies and also for de-polarizing strategies and interventions.	Behaviour and Opinion

Most of the theoretical arguments that support the concept of affective polarisation rest on social identity theory and its consequences on partisan in- and out-groups. However, current comparative measures of affective polarisation (Spread –WAPS- and Distance –WAPD-) neglect the fact that individuals’ likes and dislikes towards different parties might result from instrumental individual evaluations as much as partisan group party expressive identities (Huddy et al. 2015; Huddy et al. 2018), measured as the level to which each individual is attached to their respective group of partisans. In this paper we propose to overcome this problem with a new measure based on the following: A) a battery of feeling thermometers (like/dislike) toward different groups of party supporters (voters); B) an Identification with a Psychological Group (IDPG) scale to capture self-identified partisan social identity, designed to capture the perception of shared experiences and characteristics of group members; C) substituting the existing weights included in the WAPS and WAPD formulas that are based on the level of electoral support for each party, for the individual’s score on the IDPG latent factor.

Though also explained by ideological disagreements, intra-citizen hostility is primarily explained through the concept of social identities, and, in particular, partisanship. However, the number of partisan identifiers have either remained stable or declined in advanced democracies, and levels of party identification are no stronger than before. Why, then, is politics so divisive? I tackle this puzzle by focusing on the rise of negative partisanship, a sense of 'anti-them' identity that has come to structure political behaviour in advanced and new democracies like. I leverage survey data collected on the eve of the last German elections (N = 2000) to provide a robust measure of negative partisanship as a social identity, and show its effects on out-voter dislike via an experiment that independently triggers positive and negative party identities via news media content. I compliment the experiment with web-tracking data and automated text analysis to analyse respondents' media diets using an innovative word embedding method, allowing for article-level content analysis. I expect negative partisans to display higher levels of out-voter dislike and to disproportionately consume media content that attacks the party with which they negatively identify. This interdisciplinary paper is the first to combine the concept of negative partisanship and online news media consumption, empirically and theoretically advancing our understanding of negative political identities and their effects on affective polarisation.

High-profile dissidents in exile are often on the receiving end of states' online attacks because of their influential role in transnational advocacy networks. With connections at home and abroad, they are in a unique position to relay information between the domestic opposition and international audiences. To better understand how states respond to exiled activists within the online opposition, this paper outlines and evaluates a method for detecting targeted harassment in foreign influence operations. I propose using transfer learning with labeled Twitter data on offensive language detection and state-sponsored disinformation to identify tweets from targeted online harassment campaigns by foreign state actors. I test and evaluate this approach with data from Twitter's transparency reporting on information operations and tweets that mention high-profile exiled dissidents from China and Iran. I demonstrate the utility of this method by examining how state-sponsored online harassment campaigns differ from normal Twitter activity across political contexts. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of transferring knowledge between related text-as-data approaches for the task of detecting targeted harassment in foreign influence operations, which will enable further investigation into how online harassment campaigns factor into state strategies for transnational repression.

Effective use of these tools and methods rests on demonstrations of their performance, which in turn relies on using the right kind of data to test them. Simulations are hard to conduct well because real social science data is so complex: simplified tests using parametric data may not comport well with actual social science applications. Conversely, benchmarking on well-known studies leaves researchers unable to determine performance since the population parameters are unknown. In this paper I introduce a new solution using synthetic data: a strategy in which the underlying relationships between variables in real-world data are learned, and from which an arbitrary number of entirely new but realistic observations can be generated (i.e. “synthesised”). I use generative adversarial networks (GANs) – a form of deep learning -- to model aggregated social science datasets in order to synthesise realistic looking, but brand new, data. I then show how this data can be used to benchmark statistical designs and methods, and contribute new software for researchers to use.	Political Methodology

Gender Inequality and Political Representation in Rural India	222	Research on representative democracy often assumes that elected officials from disadvantaged and dominant groups are equally influential once in office. Drawing on an original survey in 319 Indian village councils, we leverage both reputational measures and behavioral observations to show that this assumption does not hold. Women elected through gender quotas do not equally affect decision-making in village councils after their election. Analyses suggest that this gender disadvantage can be magnified or mitigated by inequalities on other identity dimensions. Recognition of this underappreciated form of political inequality is imperative for scholars to accurately identify the strengths and limitations of descriptive representation. From a policy standpoint, this suggests that reforms aiming to increase the representation of members of disadvantaged groups (e.g. quotas) may not alone suffice to enable individuals from traditionally excluded groups to affect policy.

The effects arise because of a demand for preference alignment and only exists for bureaucratic top positions, where political attention and discretion are strongest.

However, a key dynamic remains unexplored: Are women taking over committee positions, ministries and speaking time on issues that previously were dealt with by men, or do they introduce and establish new policy areas that were previously not represented at all? The answer to this question matters for our understanding of how descriptive translates into substantive representation. Using data on parliamentary speeches, ministerial posts and committee assignments, I test how the salience of policy areas and their genderedness have changed with the increase of women's numeric representation across Europe.

Scholars have long recognized that women’s descriptive representation is determined by both demand-side and supply-side factors. Demand-side factors have to do with the preferences that voters and political elites have for women legislators, whereas supply-side factors determine the size of the pool of women with the resources to compete effectively for office. Unfortunately, existing empirical studies fail to appropriately model the complex interaction between these factors and how their effects vary across different institutional contexts. Using a new global dataset on women’s legislative representation from 1990 to 2018, I find, in line with my theoretical expectations, that the supply and mass demand framework works better in democracies than in dictatorships and that elite demand, while important in both regime types, matters much more in dictatorships. My analysis provides a potential explanation for the inconsistent results in the existing literature.	Gender Politics and Diversity

While the existing literature mainly investigates causes of women's absence from the top of politics, this paper analyses the other side of the coin, namely women's absence from the top of bureaucracy by studying the career progression of male and female civil servants. We propose that women's career trajectories in the bureaucracy depend on the ideology of the government in office. Female civil servants will have improved career opportunities under left-wing compared to right-wing government coalitions because of 1) ideology and 2) demand for preference alignment in the bureaucracy. We use a data set of all central government employees in Denmark measured quarterly from 1998 to 2019. As the Danish public sector is distinctively non-partisan and holds strong meritocratic norms for bureaucratic promotions, it provides a hard case for testing our propositions. Our results show that female career trajectories in civil service improve under left-wing governments compared to right-wing governments. The effects arise because of a demand for preference alignment and only exists for bureaucratic top positions, where political attention and discretion are strongest. Closer examination reveals the effects are due to general career disadvantages for female civil servants following shifts in government, disadvantages that are smaller if the incoming government is left-wing rather than right-wing. The results highlight some of the barriers for female policy makers’ career progression, but also highlight how partisan politics shape the national civil service.	Public Policy Administration

Evidence from quasi-experiments in Poland	1104	Our study exploits a series of quasi-experiments to estimate the causal impact of electoral rules, gender quota in particular, on the representation of women in local legislative bodies. In five municipality elections in Poland, in the years 2002-2018, the arbitrary threshold of 20000 inhabitants divided municipalities into different electoral rules. This allows to apply the sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD).In 2018, the gender quota of 35% was applied for the first time in the municipalities above the threshold. We do not find sufficiently robust evidence of any effect of gender quota on the number of elected women, age nor education of councillors, despite the strong positive effect of gender quota on the number of female candidates and the share of votes received by women.In contrast, some evidence suggests a backlash effect against female candidates running for mayors in the municipalities covered by the gender quota. Before the EPSA conference, this result will be compared with the simultaneously held elections to the legislatures of higher-level local administration (county and province), for which the data is currently being collected.Other features of the electoral system – the number of seats in the council, size of electoral districts, multiple non-transferable vote, first-past-the-post and proportional system – do not seem to have any statistically significant effect on those outcomes. Instead, the number of women in the municipality councils grows gradually with time, irrespectively of the changes in electoral rules.The paper may also fit the tracks ""Political Institutions"" and ""Behaviour and Opinion.""

Gender Inequality and Political Representation in Rural India	222	Research on representative democracy often assumes that elected officials from disadvantaged and dominant groups are equally influential once in office. Drawing on an original survey in 319 Indian village councils, we leverage both reputational measures and behavioral observations to show that this assumption does not hold. Women elected through gender quotas do not equally affect decision-making in village councils after their election. Analyses suggest that this gender disadvantage can be magnified or mitigated by inequalities on other identity dimensions. Recognition of this underappreciated form of political inequality is imperative for scholars to accurately identify the strengths and limitations of descriptive representation. From a policy standpoint, this suggests that reforms aiming to increase the representation of members of disadvantaged groups (e.g. quotas) may not alone suffice to enable individuals from traditionally excluded groups to affect policy.

Under which conditions are legislators representing minority interests? In this paper, I use parliamentary speech from Norway together with novel data on politicians' backgrounds, travels and party financing to study how local economic hardship affects parliamentary behavior. I find that MPs representing districts with high economic pressure, proxied by local unemployment, tend to deliver significantly fewer speeches in parliament. This reduced speech delivery cannot be explained by increased traveling to home districts or parliamentary absenteeism. Instead, I demonstrate that the party limits floor access once local unemployment is high, because MPs representing these districts tend to deviate more from the party line in speeches. Taken together, my results indicate that local interests are suppressed in times of distress, to avoid elevated incentives to deviate from the party line from compromising the party brand.

This paper argues that mass parties uniquely benefit from introducing party-centered electoral institutions at the local level. To test this hypothesis, I take advantage of a local governance reform in early 20th century Sweden, where the local governance type was decided by a population threshold. I find that municipalities that used a traditional type of local governance, community meetings, had higher support for the conservatives in national elections. In contrast, municipalities that used elections and representatives for local governance had higher national-level support for the communists and social democrats. A crucial difference between these parties is the way that they are organized: the social democrats and communists are organized as mass parties that rely on local branches and members as their main electoral strategy. The conservatives, on the other hand, are a typical elite party that is more dependent on connections to the bureaucracy and media than on local branches and members. These findings highlight how spillovers between different levels of politics matter for scholars, who want to evaluate the policy consequences of institutional reforms.	Political Institutions

However, how do quotas affect individual career progression across multiple levels of office, particularly where they differ or do not exist at all levels? We examine this question for European legislators, questioning how political party recruitment and nomination strategies for managing candidates at multiple levels of office differ when quotas are in use. Taking the European Parliament as a prime referent case, we assess the extent to which the use of quotas can not only help political parties to boost the presence of women in office, but it can also help to correct for leaky recruitment pipelines across multiple levels of office. Ironically, institutional choices that enhance women’s presence in legislative roles may also lead to their progressing more quickly to further positions elsewhere.	Gender Politics and Diversity

In this paper, we investigate if the election of a woman for office spearheads female representation. We rely on administrative data and close elections in Denmark from 1993 to 2017 to estimate the difference between marginally electing an additional woman compared to electing an additional man. Specifically, we focus on local elections, where a woman marginally wins a seat over a man competing for the same seat. Local elections in Denmark are proportional and most parties run on open lists where the number of personal votes alone decides who gets the seats that the party wins in the elections. Within clusters of each municipality, party list, and election year, this creates a number of close elections and in some of these, a woman marginally beats a man or not. We use this as a source of random variation in the share of elected women both within each party list and within each municipality board to estimate effects of increased female representation. Our findings show that a woman marginally elected increases the share of women within the same party in the succeeding election. The effect is driven by incumbent women being more likely to rerun, while an additional woman reduces the share of new female candidates in the future candidate pool. Other parties within the municipality also increase their share of women in the subsequent election.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Our results suggest that while women, overall, are as successful as men at the electoral stage (and voters holding more gender-equal attitudes helps), female candidates’ electoral success is particularly sensitive to party decisions at the nomination stage.

To what extent does parenting increase the probability of an interruption of one’s political career, and what are the long-term consequences for parliamentary spells and the further political career prospects? Findings in labour economics tell us that differences in career outcomes and the gender pay gap are mainly driven by the so-called motherhood penalty and that children can even have a career boosting effect for fathers. Using biographical entries of some 12.000 German state MPs from 1946 to 2019 we investigate the long-term effects of having children on political careers.	Gender Politics and Diversity

However, how do quotas affect individual career progression across multiple levels of office, particularly where they differ or do not exist at all levels? We examine this question for European legislators, questioning how political party recruitment and nomination strategies for managing candidates at multiple levels of office differ when quotas are in use. Taking the European Parliament as a prime referent case, we assess the extent to which the use of quotas can not only help political parties to boost the presence of women in office, but it can also help to correct for leaky recruitment pipelines across multiple levels of office. Ironically, institutional choices that enhance women’s presence in legislative roles may also lead to their progressing more quickly to further positions elsewhere.	Gender Politics and Diversity

However, critiques warn against generalizing from roll-calls because they are requested strategically, for example, to signal a policy position or to enforce party group cohesion. What are the patterns of roll-call vote requests and do they suggest strategic behavior? To address this question, we leverage newly collected data on all roll-call vote requests in the European Parliament for the last two-and-a-half legislatures, from 2009 until today. We sketch the patterns of roll-call requests over time, across procedures, policy areas, and actors to evaluate the degree of (un)representativeness of roll-call votes along these dimensions. We contribute to a rich literature on legislative behavior in the European Union that is based on roll-call voting and that assumes that roll-calls are a representative sample of all voting in the European Parliament. In addition, we add to the scholarly debate on the representativeness of roll-call votes with a more comprehensive large-scale study than has been carried out on EP legislation to date.

The World Health Organization, however criticized for delayed reaction on the Covid-19 challenge, is at the centre of global attention regarding achieving Universal Health Coverage (Burci 2005; Colin 2015) but very little is known about WHO Collaborating Centres, that is, scientific institutions located in more than 100 countries which actively cooperate not only with WHO, but also with national health authorities. Characterized by scientific expertise in local and global health problems WHO CCs have a unique place as Global Governance Institutions (GGIs, Yang 2021). Because they combine global mandate of WHO mission with sensitivity to local problems regarding health care, they may be a missing link between WHO and the so called Non-State Actors in Global Health. However a lack of proper cooperation between those two pillars of Global Health governance is perceived as one of the main challenges in this field and, undeniably, compromises WHO relations with its partners (Lee, Kelley and Piper 2020), WHO CCs may fill the gap between global orientation of WHO on the one hand and Non-State Actors’ activism on the other. Unfortunately, the valuable contribution of WHO CCs to Global Health often goes unnoticed in the mass media and their scientific potential is underutilized by WHO itself which constantly admits it in Evaluation Reports.

I argue that this is driven by member states cultivating ties with particular UN agencies through ideologically-driven donations to these agencies, which leads the agencies to be responsive to the donors' preferences. Consequently, states ultimately prefer the inefficiencies than risking issues being handled by agencies to which they have weaker ties. I investigate this claim empirically by showing that countries' ideological orientations influence their donation behavior in the UN. Not only do countries that are ideologically close to the US contribute more, their donation preferences differ even among agencies that are thematically similar. The results extend our understanding of states' informal influence on IOs, and highlight that continued inefficiency in the operation of UN agencies may be a pernicious problem to solve.

Yet, the focus of this literature has lied on such conflict induced by party or government preferences and not public opinion. To fill this gap, we explore how heterogeneous public preferences across the member states shape the levels of intra- and inter-institutional conflict, thus the speed of EU law-making. We argue that the levels of public polarization and salience attached to a policy area across the EU countries shape the duration of legislative negotiations. Under the conditions of increased policy salience and visibility of EU policy action, homogeneous public opinion across the member states enables the EU legislators to conclude negotiations promptly and find the compromises which satisfy the preferences of the public. However, when EU action in a policy area is not uniformly regarded as a desirable outcome across the member states, the EU legislators are constrained in the extent to which they could compromise during policy negotiation without risking political costs at home. This, in turn, protracts the interinstitutional negotiations. To test our argument, we draw on a unique dataset containing information on the duration and intensity of the trilogue negotiations between the EU legislative institutions across policy areas in the period 2009-2019 as well as public opinion data we compiled from the Eurobarometer surveys.

In the European section of this market, migrant-origin Muslim communities are approached by their countries of origin, not only as relatives and networks but also as a means of influencing European politics. On the other hand, less hierarchical and more decentralized religiosities arise from European Muslims’ changing needs for meaning and the various tools they use to communicate with fellow believers elsewhere. Both options have been taken as threats in Europe for different reasons: the former as a risk of religious-nationalist foreign infiltration (e.g., “the Gray Wolf radicalization”), and the latter as Pandora’s box, which even includes violent extremisms (e.g., “the ISIS radicalization”). This dichotomy, however, is far from capturing the tension as individuals feel and cope with it. Focusing on a selection of 160 interviews with young adults of Turkish and Moroccan origin, I will argue that the globalization mechanics (i.e., circulation, creolization, deterritorialization, de-nationalization) render migrant-origin societies a challenge against the monopoly of both the countries of residence and origin. Even though most of them frequent a mosque financed by the country of origin and support the community to have a collective voice, this participation does not necessarily take the form of submission to an unquestionable higher authority. Hence, it includes disagreements and alternative knowledge claims over subject matters such as gender and intergenerational relations, religious self-expression and identifications, the operationalization of beliefs, and their combination with traditions in the country of origin.

So far, evidence reveals a socio-demographic divide. People with higher levels of education and higher incomes tend to feel more European than their counterparts. Traditional theories explained the sorting of socio-demographic groups into political camps by pointing at the groups' different material interests or values. I argue that the sorting of social groups into identities itself serves as a cue: people take the socio-demographic profile of a political camp into account to make decisions about which camp to join and how much to identify with a political camp. More specifically, I assume that an individual is more likely to adopt a stronger European identity if she perceives that other social groups she likes have a more pro-European opinion. In contrast, if she perceives that groups she likes sort into the anti-European camp, she will be more likely to have a less strong developed European identity. To test this claim I have collected novel survey data from Austria and Italy. My findings support my theoretical claims across countries. This paper contributes to the literature on how issues and not only parties become polarized.	European Politics

The assumption of qualitative thinning out?	52	Scholarship interested in nonprofits’ repertoire of political tactics, and its possible ‘qualitative thinning out’ – i.e. a presumed shift in political tactics (Onyx et al., 2010) – has been limited by two major caveats: (1) political tactics are often reduced to advocacy tactics alone and (2) political tactics are examined within a predominantly liberal nonprofit regime. We address these issues by focusing on a neo-corporatist nonprofit regime and including politicization tactics. While advocacy aims at influencing the decisions of an institutional elite, politicization of the public sphere refers to how nonprofits stimulate public debate and shape and influence opinions by citizens in the public sphere (Almog-Bar & Schmid, 2014; Warren, 2003). Our statistical analysis is based on a database of nonprofits in Flanders, the northern region of Belgium (N = 496). Our results show that (a) advocacy is more heavily pursued than politicization, (b) there are similarities between the political repertoire of advocacy and politicization, (c) cooperative and direct political tactics are more frequently used than confrontational and indirect ones and (d) the assumption of ‘qualitative thinning out’ should be replaced by the assumption of ‘neo-corporatist path dependency’ for the Flemish context.

In the second scenario, a researcher is interested in identifying all groups referenced in a corpus of political texts. We propose a strategy combining crowd coding and supervised learning in a novel text annotation and token classification setup that addresses this second scenario. We apply this strategy to extract the group appeals of British mainstream parties between 1945 and 2019.

This paper picks up some bits and pieces from Lipset and Rokkan's famous concepts of political cleavage structures and adopts these theoretical building blocks to account for diverging electoral maps. We argue that the canonical definitions of four historical cleavages no longer sufficiently account for growing political divergences among urban vs. rural or center vs. periphery. Instead, the new cleavage of city and land is structured by strategic maneuvers of conservative parties and their relation with the populist right at the local and national levels. The empirical part of this paper explores the new divide of urban and rural interests by applying modern methods of geographical data analysis. We utilize aggregate-level electoral returns from Austrian and German electoral districts and, where available, precincts. We also merge aggregate electoral returns with survey evidence by techniques such as multilevel regression and post-stratification so as to better understand the interaction of individual preferences and local context and their joint effect upon the emergence of right-wing populist political actors.

In the last decades, new demographics—immigrants, emigrants, and youth—have been granted the right to vote. So far, the academic literature has studied each of these expansions as separate phenomena, to the detriment of common knowledge advancement. I argue that the granting of voting rights to each of these demographics should be jointly studied under the umbrella of contemporary enfranchisement. With this starting point, I propose a common theory on how parties position themselves on enfranchisement proposals. For this paper, I draw on a global dataset on the extension of the right to vote since 1960 as well as three in-depth case studies.	Parties and Representation

Not surprisingly, their emergence and electoral success has motivated a considerable amount of scholarly research. Most of the literature on the PRR, however, focuses on the national and supranational political levels, leaving the subnational level highly unexplored. This paper fills that literature gap by exploring the electoral strategies of PRR parties in substate elections and along the territorial dimension of political competition. To do so, we compare the political discourse of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) across German Länder since its first regional electoral success in 2014 until 2020. Unlike other authors who have focused on single cases or small-n comparisons using more qualitative approaches, we analyse party offer across a greater number of regions using quantitative content analysis through the Regional Party Manifesto coding. Our main argument is that PRR parties adapt to the multi-level structure of the state and make electoral use of centre-periphery issues to find a niche for themselves. Preliminary empirical findings support our main hypothesis, showing evidence of AfD’s party manifesto heterogeneity in the center-periphery dimension across German states.	Parties and Representation

We analyse the patterns of party switching in eight democracies (Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania) from the early 1990s to early 2020s. We measure the switches along multiple dimensions. First, we consider the magnitude (the number of MPs involved), the coordination of moves (individual vs. collective switching) and the sequencing of switches (simultaneous or staggered). Second, we take account of the origin of switchers: unaffiliated MPs, from one or several parliamentary groups, and combinations thereof. Third, we consider the destination of switchers: non-affiliated status, an existing or new parliamentary group, and combinations thereof. Our approach sheds new light on the complexity of party instability. Elucidating these types of party instability allows us to examine conditions under which we see actors engaging in one type versus another. For example, when are we likely to see “collective defection” (coordinated switches from one parliamentary group to another), “fission-fusion” (coordinated moves from several groups to form a new parliamentary group) or “exit” (MPs exiting their parliamentary group to become independent MPs)? Examining a broader set of possible types of instability will allow us to provide a more complete picture of parliamentary party instability than is provided in the current literature. The motivations for party switching, and the type of party switching that occurs, have consequences for party support and thus affect party systems generally.	Parties and Representation

When do Party Leaders increase their Party's Vote Share?	1138	Do popular party leaders increase the vote share of their political party? The individual-level relationship between the popularity of party leaders and reported vote choice in parliamentary elections has been well established by existing survey research, however, whether a greater popularity of party leaders actually translates into higher party vote shares has received no systematic attention. In addition, the electoral consequences of affective voter polarization over party leader images have so far not been theorized sufficiently. I purport that polarizing party leaders have a greater positive effect on their party's vote share compared to universally popular leaders, because of their greater mobilization potential. This paper examines the relationship between leader popularity and changes in party vote share using cross-national survey and administrative data on parliamentary elections. The results enhance our understanding of polarization and the personalization of politics by identifying potential micro ecological fallacies in existing research and have important implications for the selection of party leaders.

The existing research on this question deals only with the ratification of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the most prominent universal WMD treaty. It puts an emphasis on security cooperation with the superpowers and the participation of countries in rivalries or militarized disputes. However, those explanations do not satisfactorily explain the ratification of either the NPT or other WMD treaties. This paper puts forward a theoretical model that integrates factors connected with security costs and benefits, and social norms. The model argues that states that possess the given WMD, or search for it, are likely to postpone ratification. On the contrary, a security alliance with a major power supporting the respective treaty, support for multilateralism, and a high regional ratification rate motivate countries to ratify faster. The model also involves two counter-intuitive claims: that an insecure environment speeds up ratification, and that respect for human security rights had a positive effect on ratifications even before the ‘humanitarian turn’ in the field of arms control. To provide an empirical test for the model, the paper conducts a survival analysis of the ratifications of the five major universal WMD treaties during the years 1963-2018.

The external Relations of Plurilateral Non-state Actors	625	Why does Morocco have observer status in transnational parliaments in Latin America? Why does an increasing number of regional international organisations (IOs) maintain representations in third countries?This paper argues that legitimacy considerations strongly determine the external relations of IOs, which contribute to legitimising IOs in two ways. Firstly, there can be a direct effect if IOs credibly solve coordination problems and efficiently fulfil tasks that are usually provided for by states. Secondly, there can be an indirect effect that derives from either certain characteristics of an IO or the “division of labour” in external affairs between member states and an IO. A two-level architecture of external relations allows member states to exploit different configurations between these two levels. Granting specific states observer status can aim at stressing an IO’s efforts to spread democratic norms; or allow states to pursue controversial policies without straining bilateral relations.This paper looks at different forms of external relations of IOs and their underlying motives. After identifying institutional patterns of external IO relations in a quantitative large-N design, case studies will shed light on how IOs pursue external relations in order to signal legitimacy and the extent to which this is successful.

One of the main destinations of these exports and investment is Europe. As a result, emerging country multinational enterprises (EMNEs) are being exposed more than ever to new norms and practices, and new levels of exposure and potential scrutiny. What effect will this have on labor rights in developing countries such as Brazil? In this paper, we propose that as Brazilian MNEs increase their exports and investment to Europe, collective agreements will become more generous and concessional and strikes less frequent, as the MNEs try to avoid scandals in host markets and become exposed to European norms and practices. We test our conjectures using novel data measuring collective action outcomes in Brazil. We also introduce a novel method for measuring outward investment linkages which, along with subnational data on exports, is matched to our collective action data by city, economic sector, and year for the period 1992-2018, incorporating Brazil's major modern globalizing episodes. Our results confirm our hypotheses, that these economic linkages function to diffuse better collective labor standards. In addition, for the first time, we can test and confirm how the California Effect in labor standards impacts firm decision-making using direct (rather than indirect) measures of collective labor standards.

If states are restricted from challenging borders, though, what does this mean for their support of their ethnic kinsmen abroad? We suggest that states should be less likely to make demands for the separation of their co-ethnics from a neighboring state as the norm strengthens, but that they should be more likely to make demands for better treatment of the co-ethnics within the state. We test this expectation with data from the ICOW Identity Claims data set, and find support using multiple measures of the strength of the territorial integrity norm.

Yet little is understood about the conduct of middle powers in international cooperation, particularly in the international organizations (IOs) that they form. Are middle powers independent or are they beholden to greater powers, and what are the geopolitical dynamics within middle-powers IOs? Using textual analysis tools, including topic modeling, named entity recognition, and social network, on a large corpus of declassified US State Department cables from the 1970s, we explore how US officials reported on, and tried to influence, different developing country international organizations. We find that the US was not only concerned with what was happening in middle power IOs, but that they relied heavily on specific countries for information. Our findings suggest not only that text analysis is useful for the study of international organizations but that middle power IOs are important in the global landscape.

However, the Bank underwent a major reconstruction of its economic staff in the mid-1960s and within only a few years, the Economics Department became the third largest department in the Bank with over 200 newly recruited staff. The economic work at the Bank was reorganized through the central Economic Committee and economic analysis was elevated to top levels of the Bank’s operations with considerable consequences on the Bank’s behavior.This largely untapped episode of the establishment of the Bank’s economic capabilities poses a challenge to theoretical approaches to international organizations (IOs) established in fields of Political Science and International Relations. It was primarily driven by events within the Bank, without any incentives from the Bank’s shareholders and without following an explicit reorganization strategy promoted by senior management. Using it as a case in point, the paper aims to show how an organizational change can come “from within” by illustrating the instruments of staff strategic agency and the conditions that facilitate the effort of norm entrepreneurs in their attempts to shape the behavior of the IO. Furthermore, given the theoretical underdevelopment of our understanding of “staff as agents”, the paper incorporates the concept of reputation, virtually unsued in the IO scholarship, and shows how reputational concerns enabled and constrained certain types of behavior of the World Bank’s personnel.

While increasing attention is given to institutional overlap and regime complexity in the international relations literature, there is hardly any work that addresses the question of legitimacy under conditions of overlap. This paper addresses the question: How do International Organizations claim Legitimacy in Complexity? Its main contribution is to present a theoretical framework that unpacks institutional overlap and its implications for legitimation strategies employed by IOs. The relationship between IOs and their environment is theorized in terms of a business environment, where overlapping IOs are compared to business suppliers working in the same market. Borrowing the concepts of competitive advantage and differentiation strategies from the business literature, I argue that in their quest for leadership, IOs react to overlap by employing strategies of legitimation by differentiation (LegD) through which they make use of their competitive advantage. I present an exploratory case in which I analyze the legitimation claims of both the League of Arab States and the African Union in Libyan conflict in 2011 drawing on data from the both organizations’ communiques covering the first year of the Libyan conflict and preliminary data from interviews with a number of former and current officials.

Yet little is understood about the conduct of middle powers in international cooperation, particularly in the international organizations (IOs) that they form. Are middle powers independent or are they beholden to greater powers, and what are the geopolitical dynamics within middle-powers IOs? Using textual analysis tools, including topic modeling, named entity recognition, and social network, on a large corpus of declassified US State Department cables from the 1970s, we explore how US officials reported on, and tried to influence, different developing country international organizations. We find that the US was not only concerned with what was happening in middle power IOs, but that they relied heavily on specific countries for information. Our findings suggest not only that text analysis is useful for the study of international organizations but that middle power IOs are important in the global landscape.

Evidence from the OECD Development Assistance Committee	1122	Project-level data on foreign aid from the OECD creditor reporting system includes a categorical measure of the degree to which a project targets the goal of gender equality. In this paper, we study the cross-country variation in whether projects are assessed for this metric and, if so, to what degree they are marked as targeting gender. We argue that new aid donors may assess their projects for the gender marker more consistently than traditional donors, as a way to signal their commitment to transparency and responsible aid data collection to the international community. Preliminary analyses support this argument: we find that new donors assess a higher proportion of their aid flows (both in terms of project count and committed amounts), whether or not they are marking the projects as targeting gender. Across the traditional donors, we find greater variation in marking behavior but a more inconsistent assessment––in other words, traditional donors tend to assess only the projects that they mark as targeting gender. Finally, we explore the variations between target sectors and recipient countries.	International Relations and Conflict

In this paper, I argue that state representatives from weaker states can leverage this unequal power distribution and overcome institutional constraints under two conditions. First, state delegates who increase their autonomy vis-à-vis their home authorities can act relatively independent in governing bodies. Second, individual traits, such as experience and skills, can augment their bargaining position vis-à-vis an international organization. Together, these conditions can make state representatives ‘respected individuals,’ who enjoy particular standing in decision-making—from staff, management, and other state delegates. To illustrate this interaction of structure and individuals, I draw on insights from 16 semi-structured interviews with Executive Board members of the International Monetary Fund—a ‘typical’ case for decision-making of international organizations. I find that representatives from multi-country constituencies are better equipped to speak independently in discussions (in contrast to those from powerful member-states, who tend to follow their authorities’ instructions more closely). Further, by drawing on extensive experience in the Fund, these individuals can achieve disproportionate weight in negotiations. My argument plausibly extends beyond the IMF to other international institutions and multilateral negotiations. In doing so, I show how to combine structural and individual explanations to advance our understanding of decision-making in international affairs.	International Relations and Conflict

When do politicians support the enactment and enforcement of competition law? This paper examines the policy environment in which competition law is made and applied. We pose a tradeoff between taxation and competition law: Incumbent firms seek both weak competition law and reduced corporate taxation. Because politicians require revenue, the policy bundle most preferred by firms is frequently politically unfeasible. Instead, firms and politicians may agree to weak enforcement of competition policy and in exchange increased tax revenue. This bargain is especially likely under less representative political institutions, where politicians still need revenue but only weakly value consumer outcomes. We derive our theoretical claims from a formal model. To test our claims, we draw on both cross-country and within-county, industry-level data. We find that as political institutions become less representative, higher tax payments are associated with weaker competition policy.	Political Economy

Studies of European opinion on social rights for immigrants have shown that individuals exhibit little support for government transfers that benefit groups which “they do not recognize as their own”. We argue that the labour market competition and cultural approaches are insufficient to understand welfare chauvinism. We posit that natives may be afraid that immigrants will impose substantial fiscal costs on the welfare state. Using cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey, we show that individuals that perceive that immigrants receive more than they contribute and that believe that the health care system in their country will be unsustainable in ten years are more likely to hold a welfare chauvinistic position. One of the main difficulties of testing the fiscal burden argument is that the potential cost of immigration is often approached in the literature as if it was endogenous to the deservingness of immigrants (to how much effort they put in their life). We address this issue by implementing a conjoint analysis in Spain where we indicate different attributes of immigrants. In line with the fiscal burden argument, we find that individuals are less likely to be in favour of granting full social rights to immigrants that pay on average less taxes than natives and that make a higher use of the health care system. Furthermore, we see that the effect of paying less taxes is present even when immigrants are presented as working on average more hours than natives.	Political Economy

How Foreign Direct Investment Affects Protected Areas	317	There is a growing literature analyzing the effects of globalization on the environment. Yet, we know little about how economic openness affects biodiversity. In this paper, we focus on the conflicting incentives that foreign direct investment (FDI) poses on governments’ foremost strategy to protect biodiversity: the establishment of protected areas. Protected areas remove land – and its resources – from private appropriation and exploitation. Although protected areas have expanded in most countries, especially since the mid-1980s, they have done so at varying rates, which is not explained merely by geography or development. We test three competing hypotheses regarding the relationship between FDI stock and protected areas: the Race to the bottom hypothesis (FDI discourages the expansion a country’s protected areas); the California effect hypothesis (FDI is associated with a more progressive expansion of a country’s protected areas); and a variant of the Kuznets curve hypothesis (FDI has a U-shaped effect on the expansion of protected areas). Panel data analyses on a diverse sample of 60 developed and developing countries strongly support the California effect, though FDI’s positive effect is diminishing. Such finding is robust to different samples, different measures of FDI, and estimation methods. Our paper sheds new lights on globalization’s non-economic implications and adds to our understanding about how international factors influence the provision of public goods.	Political Economy

In this study, we examine the potential consequences of such behavior on the natural environment. Focusing on Vietnam, an authoritarian regime, we argue and show that even within such a context politicians seek to demonstrate high economic growth prior to elections in order to signal competence to political leaders (and voters), which directly affects the environment. Our empirical analysis is based on an original dataset of constituency-level air pollution from satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements which we match with data of individual candidates of the Vietnam National Assembly (VNA) during three electoral periods spanning the years 2007 to 2016. Leveraging on this wealth of fine-grained data, we demonstrate that air pollution fluctuates along the electoral cycle with the highest pollution measured around elections, thus indicating the presence of an environmental political business cycle (EPBC). Using a spatial error model, this paper presents an innovative way of furthering the understanding of the nexus between electoral cycles and environmental pollution. We add to the literature on (environmental) political business cycles and the role of elections in nondemocratic regimes by applying innovative measurement techniques based on satellite imagery.

Any cases of non-enforcement hence often result from a lack of enforcement capacity. In contrast, this paper argues that governments are strategic in their enforcement behavior: they enforce penalties only against some types of firms and some of the time. Building on a game-theoretic model, I show that any government that worries about potential negative economic effects from stringent enforcement hesitates to enforce regulation in equilibrium. This means that a government enforces penalties only against resilient firms and when the country's economy performs well. I test this expectation against original plant-level compliance data from European carbon markets. My findings indicate that operations from firms that are more profitable, pay more taxes and come from more resilient sectors do comply better, but this difference disappears as markets tumble. During economic crises, structural dependence on capital increases, and governments shield even resilient firms from strict penalty enforcement.	Political Economy

The recent public health crisis due to COVID19 has also catapulted questions surrounding the role and desirability of scientific expertise in politics to the forefront of public debates. Nevertheless, given the limited number of studies available and recently developed measurement tools there are still questions regarding the stability of such attitudes and replicability of previous results. This paper compares two waves of survey data in nine European democracies to map how the structure and prevalence of technocratic attitudes have changed between the pre- and post-Covid19 environment. Our analysis shows that the structure of technocratic attitudes remains stable, that is attitudes showing a strong preference for expertise, elitism, anti-politics and low preference for populism, and that the share of European citizens that exhibit such preferences has increased in every country under study. Further, the paper asks how has the experience of a global pandemic changed citizen preferences for science and expertise in political decision-making, a key dimension of technocratic attitudes? Findings suggest that preferences for experts in politics remains high among most citizen groups, though important differences remain in the way different citizens evaluate the political response to the COVID pandemic.

Further, the paper asks how has the experience of a global pandemic changed citizen preferences for science and expertise in political decision-making, a key dimension of technocratic attitudes? Findings suggest that preferences for experts in politics remains high among most citizen groups, though important differences remain in the way different citizens evaluate the political response to the COVID pandemic.

However, trade-offs between the two rights must be made as they contradict each other. In this study I will investigate citizens attitudes towards the norm conflict at the specific example of surveillance policies to prevent terrorism. Citizens can not only become the target of an attack, but also of the counter-terrorism policy which interferes with their freedom. This balancing issue is set in the context of increasing polarization over political ideology within Western democracies. While terrorist attacks are conducted to transport a political message, its counterpart the surveillance measure are debated and established by political actors. This becomes important as citizens carry an ideology themselves which brings them closer to one of these actors or further away. How do citizens balance their preferences for civil liberties and security in the context of political polarization? Using an original survey experiment conducted in Germany, I will show how the four factors (feeling threatened by a terrorist attack, becoming targeted by a surveillance measure, ideology behind an attack and ideology of counteracting politicians) influence the attitudes of citizens and whether these factors are conditional on each other. First, this paper contributes to the terrorism literature with the examination of terrorists’ ideology as an influential factor for citizens attitudes. Second, the results extend our understanding of political polarization and its strength in a context where citizens prefer a policy but have an aversion towards the political actor.

The recent public health crisis due to COVID19 has also catapulted questions surrounding the role and desirability of scientific expertise in politics to the forefront of public debates. Nevertheless, given the limited number of studies available and recently developed measurement tools there are still questions regarding the stability of such attitudes and replicability of previous results. This paper compares two waves of survey data in nine European democracies to map how the structure and prevalence of technocratic attitudes have changed between the pre- and post-Covid19 environment. Our analysis shows that the structure of technocratic attitudes remains stable, that is attitudes showing a strong preference for expertise, elitism, anti-politics and low preference for populism, and that the share of European citizens that exhibit such preferences has increased in every country under study.

To this end, we conducted a two-wave panel survey experiment in Switzerland during the campaign leading to the popular vote on the CO2 law on the 13th of June 2021. Switzerland is an ideal setting for this study as we can measure the change in peoples’ opinion on climate change separated from other issues. We collected data from news articles and twitter to estimate the sentiment and the topics of the media coverage during the campaign. Preliminary results show that campaigning on cost and cuts in mobility by the “No” campaign had a larger impact on younger people, despite their overall higher support.	Behaviour and Opinion

Government debt is thus likely to become a hot political issue again, yet we still know little about how people reason about debt sustainability. How do concerns over high debt levels compare with concerns over other salient issues such as climate change or illegal migration? How malleable are these concerns and with what consequences for people’s policy preferences and their expectations for future fiscal adjustment? We use observational and experimental data collected in Great Britain to answer these questions. We purposely designed instructional videos that summarize two different sides of the debate over debt sustainability: one video emphasizes the unprecedented levels of government debt, while the other video emphasizes the low interest rates that keep governments’ borrowing low. We randomly expose respondents to these videos and use a within-person design to examine whether watching the video changes expressed concerns about debt. Moreover, we use a between-person design to examine whether the videos affect respondents’ fiscal policy preferences and priorities as well as their expectations about future growth, inflation, and the likelihood of fiscal adjustment. This allows us to examine whether respondents have a widely shared mental model regarding the consequences of high debt. In the absence of such a mental model, politicians face fewer constraints from public opinion than commonly suggested.	Behaviour and Opinion

Specifically, we test the effects of different side-by-side article overviews views akin to the platform allsides.com alongside different detailed views that reveal bias through in-text highlighting on the perception of bias in the specific articles our participants are exposed to. The experiment randomizes over five salient political topics, ensuring that our insights are not driven by issue-specific perceptions and we elicit a range of standard individual-level covariates that allow us to systematically explore inhomogeneous treatment effects.

From there, two patterns emerge: Conventional survey scales to assess environmental and climate beliefs tend to experience ceiling effects, which is consistently very high values for most individuals, both over time and cross-county (e.g., France and Germany). Secondly, we assume new “soft” forms of climate denial emerge, leading to very limited individual action. They encompass the individual unwillingness to act, which they justify by the necessity of their own emissions, a belief in technological or offset fixes, doomism or overoptimistic beliefs. Lastly, individual action is regarded as futile as long as the political system is not changed (following Adorno and the Fridays for Future movement). We will use these notions in addition to ISSP's Franzen&Vogel (2013) scale to see if these items help to distinguish between people scoring very high in the original scale as well as how it influences different climate change policy opinions. Based on a unique survey of 500 respondents each in two countries, we assess to which degree these new forms of soft climate denial occur. Our findings can be used to create new survey items with less ceiling effects for environmental and climate policy opinion formation. In the future, policy makers that observe and try to alter these new soft forms of climate denial might have chances to succeed implementing ambitious climate policies.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, survey respondents are typically asked to report positions on complex policy issues without space for contemplation or justification. When providing quick-fire, top-of-the-head responses, it is unsurprising that voters express contradictory beliefs, or give responses that can vary haphazardly over time. Drawing on prominent models of survey response, and dual-process theories from social psychology, I argue that articulating justifications gives people reason to slow down and consider their line of thought more fully. I hypothesise that when prompted to provide justifications before stating their political positions, respondents will report attitudes that are more consistent across issues and more stable over time. I describe an experimental design and associated modelling approach to test these expectations.	Behaviour and Opinion

A New Experimental Approach	1251	How important are party cues for public opinion? While the literature on party cues has grown rapidly following the ‘experimental revolution,' it offers no general answer: Party cue effects fluctuate widely across experiments, and they are highly sensitive to contextual features of the treatment material. For instance, effects sizes depend on whether the treatment material (typically news stories) includes policy information and interest group cues, on how salient or difficult the political issue is, and on the level of elite polarization on the issue. This contingency creates a problem of external validity common to experimental research: Not all versions of treatments are equally informative about the real-world effects of a phenomenon, but researchers seldom know which to trust more, making it impossible to draw general conclusions.To address this problem of external validity, we present a novel experimental design testing the power of party cues embedded in real-world news. First, we randomly sample 80 news articles covering policy proposals from one of the world’s leading news agencies, the Associated Press. Second, we carefully edit the articles, creating two versions of each: One in which party cues are present and one in which party cues are masked. Third, we use the two versions as treatment material in a large-scale, factorial survey experiment with 8,000 nationally representative US participants. This experimental design allows us to estimate a party cue effect that averages across the different features of the news articles, but also to examine which features that enhance and reduce the effect.

Despite a large body of research, important open questions remain: First, existing evidence is mostly uninformative about the everyday inﬂuence of newspaper content on public opinion, focusing on the rare case of exposure to diﬀerent outlets. Second, it was so far not addressed how predispositions shape individual responses to news content in the real world. I address both issues exploiting a rare shift in the migration coverage of the major German tabloid newspaper Bild. I combine panel data from over 15,000 individuals with content analysis of 2.5 million newspaper articles using BERT models. The results show that a moderate increase in the emphasis of crime in migration coverage substantially aﬀects immigration attitudes, but only among individuals who do not already associate immigration with crime. These ﬁndings show that media outlets hold substantial power to shape public opinion in contemporary democracies and bring to attention the importance of predispositions in shaping individual reactions to news content.

While most research focuses on their effects on electoral and policy outcomes, political protests often aim at raising voters’ awareness for specific issues or topics. Environmental protests are a particularly interesting case – not only has the environmental cause always been strongly anchored in protests, but these protests also aim at sensitize citizens to change their behaviour in a number of ways. Importantly, our knowledge on the extent to which these efforts are effective is minimal. In a time when it is often argued that to achieve climate targets there needs to be a fundamental shift in consumer and behavioural habits, this gap is particularly relevant. This paper studies the extent to which these protests are successful by testing their effect on a number of important outcomes: voting behaviour, environmental-friendly behaviour - such as bike-usage - and environmental attitudes. Specifically, I collect a novel dataset on Fridays for Future protests in Germany, as well as on these different outcomes. I combine geospatial data with multiple data sources and conduct difference-in-differences estimations models to find that environmental protests have a positive effect on voting behaviour and that repeated exposure increases the effectiveness of protests. Additional analyses using data from panel surveys and online petition signatures further support the argument, and a comparative analysis with multiple Western European democracies tests its generalizability. Overall, this study’s findings are relevant to understand the consequences of political protest, as well as the politics of the environment more broadly.	Behaviour and Opinion

In one of the first comprehensive and systematic attempts, we explore whether a similar relationship exists transnationally – a cross-border effect stemming from environmental disasters abroad on public opinion “at home.” Spatial analyses present robust evidence that people’s environmental salience attitudes are substantially driven by disaster-related deaths in nearby countries. It follows that natural disasters cannot be treated as isolated incidents within state borders, but they rather have far-reaching, transnational consequences on public opinion and, potentially, policy. Accordingly, this research adds to our understanding of environmental politics, public opinion, natural disasters, and diffusion effects.	Behaviour and Opinion

As 60 percent of the Amazon and 12 percent of the total world’s forest area are located in Brazil, Brazilian voters are uniquely positioned to influence policies that can substantially contribute to the global fight against climate change. This paper investigates the impact of fires on political behavior in Brazil. Fires are often intentionally set for land grabbing and to expand land available for pasture and crop production. However, fires can get out of control and spread much beyond what fire setters initially expected, affecting broad segments of the population that do not benefit economically from them. Fires can therefore also be expected to increase environmental concern and to shift political attitudes by increasing the salience of environmental degradation. By exploiting exogenous variation in fires caused by weather conditions, we investigate whether fires increase support for green party candidates. We further examine how the impact of fires on political behavior is shaped by the local population’s reliance on the agriculture and livestock sector.	Behaviour and Opinion

Employing a difference-in-differences design at the level of 1400 polling stations, the analysis shows how the vote share of the incumbent socialist bloc, who has held clear issue ownership on climate change, increased by up to two percentage points in flood-stricken areas. Moreover, flooding exposure also led to a higher vote share for electoral candidates running on pro-climate platforms – both within and across parties. Together, these results suggest that the flood caused affected citizens to shift support towards parties and candidates with a pro-climate agenda rather than, for example, punishing them for being governmental incumbents. The study thus provides a vivid example of how personal weather experiences can translate into actual political behavior.	Behaviour and Opinion

We contribute to the bourgeoning empirical literature in this field by focusing on the micro-level. We examine whether and why different environmental stressors aspire people to move. The analysis relies on newly collected survey data of approximately 1800 households residing along the 200 kilometers of the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. We employ a quasi-experimental design to compare affected and unaffected populations at a similar baseline risk in experiencing different types of environmental events in order to isolate the causal effect of deteriorating environmental livelihoods on migration aspirations. The results suggest that individual perceptions of negative environmental conditions motivate people to consider moving away from their homes. However, while short-term environmental events, i.e., floods do not affect migration aspirations, long-term environmental events, i.e., riverbank erosion increase aspirations for permanent internal migration. These results suggest that depending on the type of environmental event, people might prefer adaptation to migration, and hence they entail important policy implications with regard to the effects of climate change on future internal migration flows.

Related literature depicts two very different set of predictions. The field on welfare preferences portrays individuals as rational calculators, while motivated reasoning scholarship rather presents public opinion as being emotionally-driven, striving to confirm beliefs. I reconcile these two strands of work by proposing that while individuals seek out to confirm their beliefs most of the time, they may sometimes face larger incentives to update these and reach accurate conclusions. Such incentives are likely to be present if individuals are directly affected by an issue or/and care strongly about it. I employ comparative online experimental data to test this argument. Findings show that scientific information does not increase attention or shape to policy proposals, and neither does belief-congruent information. Rather, prior beliefs per se, have a direct impact on attention and support. This is the case even when they face significant incentives to update their beliefs, in order to translate their interests to relevant policy preferences. The findings presented in this paper have far reaching implications to the study of preferences, motivated reasoning and the politics of UBI.	Political Economy

I use a novel hand-collected database including the universe of Catholic priests' appointed in rural Spain between 2000 and 2019, and leverage on the quasi-natural experiment by which foreign priests are allocated to Spanish parishes. I find foreign priests are able to mobilize their parishioners towards more conservative and religious positions. Moreover, having a foreign priest fosters a change in people's local spending preferences, giving priority to community building expenditures. However, foreign priests also reduce people's desire for a status-quo change, measured as preserving francoist street names.	Political Economy

Evidence from a Multilevel Analysis	938	There has in recent years been a growing interest in the citizens' lack of confidence in public authorities.

The interest has further been amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic where public authorities have been responsible for enforcing containment and closure policies vis-à-vis the citizens. Although there are a number of both macro and micro-level studies of attitude formation towards public authorities, there is a lack of knowledge about how the two levels interact. Studies suggest that education is a key factor in public opinion formation (Bovens and Wille 2017; Steen 1996; Kuhn et al. 2016; Hakhverdian and Mayne 2015). However, the direction between education and confidence is not clear. On the one hand, citizens with longer educations are more informed and then, likely to be more critical towards dysfunctional public authorities. On the other hand, people with higher education have more competencies in understanding and interacting with public authorities which might be translated into higher confidence. The article makes use of data spanning 162664 individuals across 34 countries in the period 1994-2020 for a multi-level model which enables us to examine how the level of education interacts with important macro-level drivers in terms of the procedural and distributional fairness as well as the output, and process performance of the public authorities.

Since citizenship is a requirement for participation in federal and state elections, a growing number of people is excluded from political decision-making.

Therefore, local administrations that aim to increase naturalization rates often initiate their own naturalization campaigns.

Since campaigns can be substantially different, we also document and evaluate individual campaigns to identify elements that can promote or hinder their success. Our analysis shows that campaigns can work well – if they do not solely address foreigners but involve the administration as well.	Public Policy Administration

The notion that policies diffuse from one country to another is well understood in political science and economics. The ways in which this could happen in the context of debt crisis resolution policies, however, remains largely unexplored. By focusing on the external and domestic incentives of sovereign debt repayment, the literature on sovereign default indeed typically neglects the role of across-state learning mechanisms in shaping sovereign debt management. To fill that gap, this paper fits a longitudinal network model to assess whether and how defaulting countries observe the experiences of others, when restructuring their debts with foreign private creditors. In particular, the model tests whether incumbents look at the impact that given repayment actions have had on the economic and electoral performance of peer governments in other countries. Results seem to indicate that this is indeed the case: past electoral and economic performance in other countries significantly affects the probability that governments adopt the same repayment behaviour as others.

This paper examines voters’ attitudes about rapid currency depreciation as well as their preferred policy responses. We argue that voters’ job insecurity strongly influences their attitudes about currency crises. Specifically, individuals with high degrees of j ob insecurity express stronger concern about currency depreciation, they are more opposed to orthodox policy responses such as raising the interest rate, and they are also more supportive of unorthodox policy responses, such as intensifying capital controls. Data from nationally representative surveys in two countries experiencing currency crises—Argentina and Turkey—support our argument. A follow-up survey experiment in Turkey, which randomly primed some respondents about deteriorating labor-market conditions, provides further evidence. This treatment influenced attitudes about currency depreciation, interest rate policy, and capital controls among the subset of individuals that are particularly vulnerable to job loss during a currency crisis—those with low education and low incomes. Overall, the results show that concerns about the labor market have a strong and systematic influence on how voters respond to currency crises.	Political Economy

Financial crisis management and inequality	584	Critics of the Eurozone crisis management maintain that the measures taken at the height of the Great Recession have increased economic inequality across Europe and especially within the most affected member states of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Such assessments face, however, a double challenge. First, financial crises have typically divergent effects on the gap between the rich and the poor, with currency and inflation crises enlarging it and banking crises reducing it. Second, certain rescue measures by national governments or international donors can partly offset the negative impact of austerity. To address the puzzling variety of crisis management outcomes, we develop a political economy framework that links the type and severity of the crises to the measures of the national governments and the international donors. Empirically, we compare the effects of the crises measures for the OECD world from 1970 to 2018. The empirical study uses a difference-in-difference design and shows how both crises and rescue measures have affected the real wage development in different economic sectors and in the entire society. Our research design differentiates between spending- and tax-based austerity programmes and accounts for the underlying conditionality of international loans. The analysis demonstrates the moderating role of government ideology and polarization. We also assess whether regional crises such as Great Recession have more pronounced effect than purely national crises.	Political Economy

In some countries, suchchanges altered consolidated institutional equilibria with regard to political representation.Focusing on cross-country variations of electoral fragmentation between1946 and 2020, this article analyses how exposure to financial crises andfinancial assistance explain the stability of electoral competition. Using pooledand difference-in-difference analyses, the main finding of this research shows thatexposure to economic shocks results in more electoral fragmentation only whennation-states lose much of their decision-making power to use local knowledge toidentify and adopt suitable economic policies to face economic adversities.

This paper examines voters’ attitudes about rapid currency depreciation as well as their preferred policy responses. We argue that voters’ job insecurity strongly influences their attitudes about currency crises. Specifically, individuals with high degrees of j ob insecurity express stronger concern about currency depreciation, they are more opposed to orthodox policy responses such as raising the interest rate, and they are also more supportive of unorthodox policy responses, such as intensifying capital controls. Data from nationally representative surveys in two countries experiencing currency crises—Argentina and Turkey—support our argument. A follow-up survey experiment in Turkey, which randomly primed some respondents about deteriorating labor-market conditions, provides further evidence. This treatment influenced attitudes about currency depreciation, interest rate policy, and capital controls among the subset of individuals that are particularly vulnerable to job loss during a currency crisis—those with low education and low incomes. Overall, the results show that concerns about the labor market have a strong and systematic influence on how voters respond to currency crises.	Political Economy

But who is engaging with political content online and how do segments of the online public differ, e.g. between their primary arenas of engagement? The state of the online public discourse is a disputed issue. Against the notion of polarized, low-quality discussions, featuring misinformation and hate speech in online environments, the concept of deliberation represents an ideal form of political discussions and offers a constructive angle to examine online environments. Mapping the online public discourse is empirically challenging. Most previous research focused on specific aspects, such as news media diets (Guess, 2020) or online discussions in specific arenas (Esau et al., 2020).Using digital trace data in combination with large­scale survey data from Germany, we map out who selects into engaging with political content on various types of sites, relevant for the online public discourse. We further construct a typology of users and compare characteristics and behaviors between profiles.Overall, we do not find strong patterns of selective exposure and a large demographic and attitudinal overlap in the audiences of different segments of the online public sphere. However, especially people with high education and high political knowledge engage with political information online. When considering online forums and other platforms that enable political expression and discussion, we find that, in tendency, people with more extreme political views are particularly active. Our study contributes the first evidence from digital trace data to the empirical literature on online deliberative systems.	Political Communication

Recent advances in collecting the traces of people’s online activity have created potential to improve mea- surement of media habits in general. However, traces have been rarely used to test how people’s self-reported news exposure corresponds to actual news exposure.

In this pre-registered project relying on a multi-wave survey and several months of browsing data with a US sample (n = 2,219), we examine how well self-reported general news exposure, as well as self-reported outlet-specific exposures, corresponds to actual consumption. Beyond comparing the raw self-report to behavioral exposure, we also examine how correspondence changes when taking into account (a) how much people say they consume news online versus offline (b) how much they report to use other devices than the one from which we get traces (c) how much other people use the browser from which we get the traces.

Currently, we have very limited knowledge of the effects that CAs have on influencing important issues for the public (issue salience). In this study, we aim to examine the influence that CAs have on the transference of issue salience and compare these results with other channels for news consumption. Through a seven-day longitudinal survey, we compared the most important issues reported by users (N = 352) consuming different news channels, such as CA, social media, and news websites. Although our results were not significant, our analysis suggests that those consuming news via CAs have a lower probability of agreeing on what issues are more important to the country compared to participants consuming news on social media and news websites. The findings indicate that news consumption through CAs can decrease shared context compared to users consuming news in other channels. In addition, our results suggest that high trust in the channel and attention to political news in algorithmically driven channels decreases the probabilities of agreeing on what is important for society. The results pose important questions for further research such as the impact and democratic role of CAs in the overall news ecology.	Political Communication

Taking advantage of a unique data set on the ideological position of Swiss municipalities and members of parliament, we can explore this question in a ‘real action’ context. We find that voters support the adoption of direct democratic institutions if their own ideological position is closer to the median voter than the median member of parliament. We argue that such representation deficits are particularly likely in case of electoral systems that are conducive to majoritarian and partisan biases and thus lead to the systematic under-representation of large political groups. Importantly, this effect of ideological distance remains robust when controlling for socio-demographic minorities (religious, linguistic, and social), direct democratic traditions at local level, and electoral support for the main political parties.

In this paper, I propose a complementary framework in which the differences between extreme and moderate voters are analyzed through a multilevel strategy. By combining cross-sectional European electoral data and individual panel data from Germany and Spain, I show that ideologically extreme voters perceive the parties as holding more extreme ideological positions. This happens regardless of whether voters and parties are leftist or rightist. Cross-sectional data shows the divergence between extreme voters from various European countries, which accounts for differences of polarization among the countries and variance between European parties. Individual data shows that polarization has a double component: extreme voters are farther away from their non-supported parties not only because of voters’ extreme positions but also because they are allocated more to the extremes by these voters. Therefore, I show voters on different sides of the spectrum more and more withdraw into their own realities, making democratic compromise difficult on this qualitatively distinct level. In all, my results suggest that projection models of voters’ perception and polarization studies should consider voters’ extremism as one of the variables explaining parties ’perceptions.

This question received considerable attention in the literature in the past decade. Previous research has shown that most voters have somewhat ‘correct’ perceptions of where parties are located on a left-right dimension, and that certain factors, like coalition membership, rhetoric, and changes in party leadership, influence how much those perceptions deviate from the real positions on average. Recent research demonstrated that ‘demand side’ factors, like which topics are most important to voters, also influence how they perceive party positions. This paper adds to this, relaxing the unitary actor assumption and introducing heterogeneity on the ‘supply side’ to the analysis. I argue that if party elites have heterogeneous positions, voter estimates of party positions deviating from the mean position but falling within the range of positions held by party elites can be considered just as correct, changing the notion of what should be considered a deviation from the correct position.I test this expectation by combining individual-level data on voter party perceptions with a novel data set on intraparty heterogeneity, which exploits textual data from Twitter to estimate the positions of MPs in several European countries. The findings have potential implications for mass-elite linkages, representation, as well as voting behavior.	Parties and Representation

We analyze Ukrainian trade transactions before and after the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that Ukrainian firms from districts with fewer ethnic Russians experienced a deeper decline in trade with Russia. This decline is economically significant, persistent, and can be explained by erosion of inter-group trust. Affected Ukrainian firms suffered a decrease in performance and diverted trade to other countries. Our results suggest that, through social effects, conflict can be economically damaging, even away from combat areas.	Political Economy

I draw from established theories of how trauma can shape political participation and utilise the concepts of re-traumatization and risk-aversion to predict how battlefield outcomes vary due to past exposure to famine. I leverage individual-level data from the Union Army in the US Civil War to investigate how cohorts of Irish soldiers differ in their behaviour compared to counterfactual cohorts of soldiers from other immigrant groups. I validate this approach by observing the physical effects of famine on soldier heights and use various strategies such as estimating soldiers’ origins in Ireland to capture individual-level famine intensity. I find that soldiers born just before the potato famine participate at consistent rates but desert from the battlefield at higher rates than both their older compatriots or equivalent cohorts of other immigrants. I rule out an alternative economic mechanism and highlight that a risk-aversion mechanism best explains these elevated patterns of desertion. This research contributes to our understanding of the psycho-social effects of war and how behaviour during conflict is influenced by earlier trauma.	International Relations and Conflict

Despite the seemingly fast recovery after the Civil War of 1918, the wounds of the conflict are still present in subtle ways in Finnish society. In a survey conducted by the Finnish public broadcasting company YLE, 68% of respondents said the conflict still divides Finns at least to some extent. But where do these dividing lines show up and how? Do municipalities that were more exposed to the civil war vote differently from those that were less exposed? Or do individuals with a family history of the civil war hold different political views?To answer questions such as these, we combine historical and contemporary data sets with modern micro-econometric methods. The primary purpose of our paper is to leverage within-country variation in exposure to the civil war to study (i) what were the immediate political impacts of the Finnish Civil War, and (ii) how the relationship between civil war exposure and voting behavior evolved over time. We also use survey data on modern-day political elites to examine how the civil war influences ideology today.	Political Economy

This transit is new for the Ukrainian mentality, both politically and socio-culturally. For instance, a measure of successful adaptation is the call for nationality and unity through the formation of the image of a patriot, promoted more actively in the post-revolutionary periods. Namely, the law on the language was adopted, which consolidates the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language. Today, Ukraine is in the stage of cultural openness and cooperation, whereas the investment in culture is a contribution to the national unity, education and erudition. Thus, Ukraine enters the world arena, enhancing its image. Ukrainian students have the opportunity to go to work or study abroad, which demonstrates the positive dynamics of the future state development. The imprint imposed on people of the past stage, in this case, the Soviet past, contributes to the development of a contrasting position regarding the polarity of ""freedom of speech, a course towards NATO"" v. ""stability, the idea of ​​a hegemony, a strong and united power"", expressed in the pro-Russian or pro-European vector of further development of the Ukraine. The issue of transition to a market economy and effective management of foreign investment is also on the agenda. Such a transit of Ukraine of a new formation will be briefly presented in my proposals.	Comparative Politics

We analyze Ukrainian trade transactions before and after the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that Ukrainian firms from districts with fewer ethnic Russians experienced a deeper decline in trade with Russia. This decline is economically significant, persistent, and can be explained by erosion of inter-group trust. Affected Ukrainian firms suffered a decrease in performance and diverted trade to other countries. Our results suggest that, through social effects, conflict can be economically damaging, even away from combat areas.	Political Economy

We argue that uncertain and/or discriminatory property rights can impede the decision to return home after forced displacement. This effect has larger implications for the transition from conflict to peace because certain social groups are selectively favored for economic recovery and access to political power. This critical institutional factor is often overlooked in studies of return from displacement. Empirically, we assess the effect of secure property rights on the decision to return in post-conflict Iraq using survey data on the origin and destination of Iraqi internally displaced persons and returnees from 2019 in a spatial matching framework. We show that individuals with more secure property rights are more likely to return home after displacement than individuals lacking written documentation and facing other barriers to access to their housing and land, suggesting that property rights and a stable transition to peace are interlinked. We complement this observational data with experiments embedded in a 2021 survey conducted in Monsul and Sinjar that explore the importance of property rights in return decisions.

In this paper, we ask whether this exposure has the same effect on migrants themselves---particularly those who migrate abroad temporarily for employment. While contact may foster tolerance, labor migrants often encounter ethnic outgroups in hierarchical and transactional circumstances; the impact of these encounters on intergroup relations are not well understood. Partnering with local governmental and non-governmental organizations in Mizoram, India, we conducted a randomized controlled trial on cross-border migration in which we connected individuals seeking overseas employment with job opportunities in the Persian Gulf region’s hospitality sector. Two years after the program began, individuals in the treatment group grew significantly more tolerant toward ethnic, cultural, and national outgroups---both toward groups that migrants worked and lived alongside (other South Asians) and toward groups migrants interacted with only in service settings (Middle Easterners and Europeans). These results imply that migrant-native interactions shape attitudes in both directions, and that the contact itself matters more than its nature. This increased tolerance also bolstered support for cooperative foreign policy, such as international trade and diplomatic cooperation; by contrast, it had little effect on attitudes toward national integration.

But why do some states colonize frontier areas with settlers and others do not? I examine this question in the context of New Guinea, a large island that both Australia and Indonesia attempted to colonize over the 20th century. I have compiled new, detailed panel data on all Indonesian state-sponsored transmigration (in West Papua) and white settlement (in Papua New Guinea) over the 20th century. My findings are twofold. First, colonization is responsive to geopolitics --- both Australia and Indonesia escalated efforts to settle New Guinea in response to new security threats. Second, developing countries are much more effective colonizers. The promise of free land drew 300,000 Indonesians to New Guinea but drew only 1,500 whites there given much higher standards of living for Europeans on the Australian mainland. Shortly after the failure of white colonization, Australia peacefully decolonized Papua New Guinea. This paper therefore shows how settler colonialism is generally only a viable state building strategy for poor countries whose populace can be lured to contested frontiers with the promise of free land. I draw out the implications of these findings for our understanding of why other Western states like Greece, Portugal, the United States, and Russia ceased settling contested lands over the 20th century, and the logic of colonization in territorial conflict more generally.

The relationship between FDI and economic development has been discussed by academics and policymakers. Literature suggests that FDI contributes to higher economic growth by triggering technology spillovers, helping the formation of human capital, integration of international trade, creation of competitive business environment. An emerging literature highlights the importance of investment climate in post-conflict countries. Promotion of a strong investment environment is a key driver of post-conflict recovery, especially in supporting growth, creating jobs, and enhancing well-being. FDI is likely to be higher in strong growth countries compared to weak growth countries at the end of conflict. In the immediate aftermath of conflict, investors are cautious to invest because of political, security and business risks. There are many ways to improve the investment climate and therefore improve economic development. In addition to more orthodox approaches, current research focuses on post-conflict countries’ ability to attract FDI by implementing TJ mechanisms. Even though FDI favors countries that have natural resources, peace policies and commitment also matter. Using a panel data regression analysis, this paper tests for the influence of TJ on the relationship between FDI and economic development with moderation analysis for conflict countries between 1970-2006. I expect to observe that TJ strengthens the positive nature of the FDI-economic development relationship in post-conflict countries.	International Relations and Conflict

Although the relationship between elections and conflict has been studied extensively, in this paper we focus on the reasons why ex-combatants participate in democratic politics and the way in which they do so. We use individual information on the participation in communal assemblies’ meetings of more than 10,000 former members of the paramilitaries in Colombia and data on the universe of candidates who stood for election between 2003 and 2015. On the one hand, we describe the characteristics of this participation: we analyze who participates in politics, where they do it, and what kind of activities they carry out. On the other hand, we study the impact of their participation on the selection and performance of candidates. Relying on a difference-in-difference strategy, we explore the impact of the participation of former ex-combatants on right-wing candidates, polarization, and the competitiveness of elections. The paper allows us to advance our understanding of electoral dynamics in the post-conflict period, making use of detailed information on participation and wartime experience.

This paper proposes that differences in men and women's post-conflict political engagement may be due, in part, to the type of violence used against them during conflicts. In particular, given the psychological impact of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), and the shame and stigma associated with it in many societies, this may reduce engagement in post-conflict political life. Women are disproportionately the victims of CRSV, which may account for asymmetric gender effects of conflict violence found in some contexts. We test this argument through a combination of new experimental data and existing survey data from multiple conflicts, where we find no gendered effect of general conflict violence. Conversely, we find that women who are victims of conflict-related sexual violence have lower rates of post-conflict political engagement. These findings highlight the importance of considering how different patterns of conflict violence affect post-conflict political engagement.	International Relations and Conflict

Evidence, however, reveals increasing FDI inflows in post-conflict countries. A question remains as to why foreign firms systematically invest in post-conflict settings despite greater risk. This paper contends comprehensive peace agreements (CPAs) serve as credible signals to attract FDI in post-conflict countries. Namely, CPAs include specific provisions alleviating two credible commitment problems salient in low-information, post-conflict settings. First, CPAs bolster the host country's credible commitment to peace through ‘cost-increasing provisions’ that escalate the costs of re-arming and re-mobilizing for government and rebel forces alike. Second, CPAs resolve the commitment problem of expropriation through judicial provisions safeguarding property rights and contract enforcement. Employing Arellano and Bond's (1991) generalized method of moments estimation, I examine the effect of CPA provisional variation on FDI inflows using UNCTAD FDI data for 206 countries from 1990-2015. Findings reveal post-conflict countries adopting CPAs with cost-increasing provisions attract significantly greater FDI inflows. A key implication suggests CPAs may help facilitate economic development through FDI in the initial post-conflict years, when states may be most vulnerable to conflict relapse.

The goal of this paper is twofold: mapping changes in attitudes towards migration over time, and constructing a person-centred typology (instead of a variable-centred typology) that explains such trends.Part one of our quantitative analyses corroborates the Group Conflict Theory (GCT), which postulates that intergroup competition influences the attitudes towards the representatives of the outgroup, such as ethnic minorities or immigrants (Blumer 1958). These perceptions are influenced not only by the structural position of the individual (i.e. socio-economic status) but also by the contextual factors, such as changes in economic situation or an influx of migrant population (Blalock 1967). Building on the dynamic version of GCT (Meuleman et al. 2009) and using all nine rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) data, we will delineate the change in attitudes towards migrants and migration before, during, and after the refugee crisis of 2015-2016, covering the period from 2002 to 2018.Second, we will investigate the typology of attitudes towards migrants and migration by applying multilevel latent class analysis (MLPA) to the ESS data (Meeusen et al., 2017). By applying the MLPA to the data from the two ESS modules focused on the attitudes towards migration and asylum policy, i.e. round 1 (2002-2003) and round 8 (2016-2017), we show that there has been a shift in attitudinal profiles at the individual and at the country level before and after the refugee crisis.

Governments in Western democracies have recently taken restrictive stances on migration and the integration of ethnic minorities. Face veil policies in particular are becoming increasingly common across Western democracies, with many countries adapting partial or full bans. While most research on the reactions to policies is focused on the consequences of intergroup contact, less is known about how voters react to these policies. In this study, we address this gap by assessing the effect of policies targeting ethnic minorities on outgroup hostility. In what we term policy cues, we argue these policies are means by which political actors define who is entitled to be a member of a polity. We test this argument by leveraging on Canton-level policies on face veils in Switzerland and study its impact on outgroup hostility, which we measure through hate crime, voting behaviour and political attitudes. Using a series of difference-in-differences designs, we find that these policies have important behavioural consequences for the integration of immigrants and those of ethnic and religious minorities. This study has implications for how policies impact the attitudes and behaviours of voters and the cohesiveness of multicultural societies.	Behaviour and Opinion

Many see these laws as targeting religiously-observant Muslim women. What effect might these policies have on public attitudes towards immigrants from outside of Europe, many of whom are Muslim? We argue that public discussion of restricting religious symbols can influence public attitudes towards immigrants by signaling to the public that religiously-observant Muslims are not members of a socially constructed in-group and by heightening in-group/out-group distinctions, leading public attitudes to become more negative towards immigrants. To test this hypothesis, we draw on public opinion data from the Eurobarometer Survey Series to measure public affect towards immigrants between 2009 and 2018 in three European countries that passed laws banning the wearing of full face veils: France, Belgium, and Austria. We also use Pew Global Attitudes Survey data to look closely at specific attitudes towards Muslims in France in 2006 and 2011. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe, and how they are affected by public policy.	Behaviour and Opinion

Newer work extends this to consider how knowledge is relevant for other outcomes, including attitudes and policy preferences. Yet observational surveys often lack questions testing respondents’ factual knowledge about particular topics. Consequently, extant work relies on batteries of general political knowledge questions to distinguish more informed voters from less informed ones. This invokes a potentially strong assumption: possessing general knowledge should be diagnostic of holding issue-specific knowledge. We empirically test this assumption using 2018 survey data from seven European countries (Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, UK) that, unusually, includes knowledge questions about general politics as well as EU immigration (N=11,429). After building knowledge scales using item response theory, we construct counterfactual models that simulate how becoming more informed about either general politics or EU migration changes respondents’ immigration attitudes and preferences (an ‘information effect’). Then, we compare the sizes and directions of these effects across both types of knowledge questions. Our results make two contributions: (1) novel cross-national evidence of how and to what extent EU immigration attitudes and preferences are sensitive to citizens’ levels of different kinds of knowledge, and (2) empirical evidence about the validity of using general political knowledge questions as a proxy for respondents’ specific knowledge about issues. This presents implications for information effects research that depends on these common survey question types.	Behaviour and Opinion

Some argue that cognitive dissonance will lead people experiencing outgroup suffering to have a more negative view of outgroup members (Homola et al. 2020), while others will argue that exposure to outgroup suffering will increase empathy and decrease hostility towards outgroup members. In order to advance this debate, I analyze the mainly forgotten case of German refugees in Denmark after World War II (and after the German occupation of Denmark), where Denmark was home for several years to around 200,000 German refugees (mainly women and children) which were eventually repatriated. Using geo-coded data on the distribution of refugees and major refugee camps in the 1940s as well as a 1971 survey containing information about attitudes to Germans, I show that respondents living in areas with a previously higher concentration of German refugees in the 1940s held more negative attitudes towards Germans in 1971. This effect of local German refugee exposure on attitudes towards Germans is only negative for older Danes which would have been more likely to personally being exposed to the German refugees and having experienced the German occupation of Denmark.

We addressed this gap by adopting a social network approach to scrutinize the Telegramsphere as an information-sharing ecosystem of current affairs by uncovering how information flows indicated by content overlap and shared users influenced the structure of Telegram networks and shaped communities overtime. Using state-of-the-art web-mining and social network analysis techniques on a unique data set that spanned the full messaging history (N= 2,033,661) of 174 Dutch-language public Telegram chats/channels, we show that the structure of the observed networks was strong and highly distinctive. Over time, conspiracy-themed, far-right activist, and COVID-19-sceptical communities dominated the Dutch Telegramsphere of current affairs. Overall, the results indicated that consuming socially and politically relevant information in the Telegramsphere exposes users to content spillover from far-right and extremist communities especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that more moderate and extremist chats/channels were “linked in the dark” raises concerns that the Dutch Telegramsphere has morphed into a ” self-perceived corrective'' against the ""biased'' views of established institutions.

While extant research in the field of political communication is mostly concerned with algorithmic bias, user-driven bias had been largely neglected. Yet, search queries are the key way in which searchers explicate their information need. Building on framing theory and selectivity in political information we argue that search queries are ingrained with the searcher’s (political) predispositions. Issue frames in mind of searchers manifest themselves in their search terms and queries. We explore how individuals use search queries to find political information (RQ1), and how these searcher types relate to political and socio-demographic characteristics (RQ2). We examine the cases of immigration and climate change in the Netherlands and collect survey data among a representative sample of the population (N = 1,994). We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding and Latent Class Analysis to identify searcher types, which we regress on issue attitudes, issue importance, and other political and socio-demographic indicators. We find that search queries co-occur to form searcher types that are related to the searcher’s personal characteristics. Notably, searchers formulate queries in ways that are related to their political positions, but this differs for different issues. These findings imply a systematic bias in user-input on search engines which is probably transferred to the search results. Future research needs to consider both user choices and algorithmic factors when auditing search engines on political bias.	Political Communication

In line with the liberal IR theory, I posit that the flows of publicly available, politically relevant information between states may be expected to reflect the patterns of their economic inter-dependence. At the same time, drawing on realist theorizing in IR and on sociology of media, I formulate alternative hypotheses that highlight the importance of the power of nations and of factors associated with the logic of media systems for the patterns of information flows globally. To evaluate the relative merit of these propositions, I present the first large scale map of the intensity of ties that connect more than 160 states in the realm of public information flows, as reflected in more than 3000 online media outlets. For each of the more than 2 000 000 articles from these outlets, forming a carefully defined sample from global media in 2018-2019, I use natural language processing tools to estimate the frequency of references to all countries in the world. Non-English articles, forming around 75% of the sample, have been automatically translated into English to allow for consistent processing and analysis. A preliminary analysis of the data partly supports all three lines of theoretical reasoning, but it lends much more value to the realist and media studies hypotheses, at the expense of the liberal interdependence hypothesis.

Using state-of-the-art web-mining and social network analysis techniques on a unique data set that spanned the full messaging history (N= 2,033,661) of 174 Dutch-language public Telegram chats/channels, we show that the structure of the observed networks was strong and highly distinctive. Over time, conspiracy-themed, far-right activist, and COVID-19-sceptical communities dominated the Dutch Telegramsphere of current affairs. Overall, the results indicated that consuming socially and politically relevant information in the Telegramsphere exposes users to content spillover from far-right and extremist communities especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that more moderate and extremist chats/channels were “linked in the dark” raises concerns that the Dutch Telegramsphere has morphed into a ” self-perceived corrective'' against the ""biased'' views of established institutions.

While extant research in the field of political communication is mostly concerned with algorithmic bias, user-driven bias had been largely neglected. Yet, search queries are the key way in which searchers explicate their information need. Building on framing theory and selectivity in political information we argue that search queries are ingrained with the searcher’s (political) predispositions. Issue frames in mind of searchers manifest themselves in their search terms and queries. We explore how individuals use search queries to find political information (RQ1), and how these searcher types relate to political and socio-demographic characteristics (RQ2). We examine the cases of immigration and climate change in the Netherlands and collect survey data among a representative sample of the population (N = 1,994). We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding and Latent Class Analysis to identify searcher types, which we regress on issue attitudes, issue importance, and other political and socio-demographic indicators. We find that search queries co-occur to form searcher types that are related to the searcher’s personal characteristics. Notably, searchers formulate queries in ways that are related to their political positions, but this differs for different issues. These findings imply a systematic bias in user-input on search engines which is probably transferred to the search results. Future research needs to consider both user choices and algorithmic factors when auditing search engines on political bias.	Political Communication

In line with the liberal IR theory, I posit that the flows of publicly available, politically relevant information between states may be expected to reflect the patterns of their economic inter-dependence. At the same time, drawing on realist theorizing in IR and on sociology of media, I formulate alternative hypotheses that highlight the importance of the power of nations and of factors associated with the logic of media systems for the patterns of information flows globally. To evaluate the relative merit of these propositions, I present the first large scale map of the intensity of ties that connect more than 160 states in the realm of public information flows, as reflected in more than 3000 online media outlets. For each of the more than 2 000 000 articles from these outlets, forming a carefully defined sample from global media in 2018-2019, I use natural language processing tools to estimate the frequency of references to all countries in the world. Non-English articles, forming around 75% of the sample, have been automatically translated into English to allow for consistent processing and analysis. A preliminary analysis of the data partly supports all three lines of theoretical reasoning, but it lends much more value to the realist and media studies hypotheses, at the expense of the liberal interdependence hypothesis.

Numerous organizations express every day the concerns and demands of its constituents thus forging the narratives that shape the agenda for dealing with policy issues in multiple sectors. However, given the volatility of policy agendas and an emphasis on studying policy outcomes, it is difficult to follow the diversity and complexity of multiple actors and issues and more importantly, to understand their potential influence on the policy process. Using data from press releases and tweets of the 150 most salient interest groups, unions, and social movement organizations and MPs and parties in Spain in a ten-year period, this paper uses computational linguistics techniques to measure the degree in which narratives and frames of interest group organizations are appropriated by political elites on multiple issues across arenas in a longitudinal perspective. Results show that the adoption of interest group rhetoric varies by party ideology and status, interest group type and issue salience. The implications of the adoption of public narratives by elites are discussed in light of the agenda dynamics and policy influence literatures.	Parties and Representation

While much has been written on the development of corporatist structures and political actors separately, less is known about relationship between corporatism and interest groups’ interaction with political parties. It has been argued that formal incorporation in governmental policy processes in corporatist countries is a substitute for organizational ties to political parties and incorporated interest groups may as a result find such ties less useful. However, in this paper, we suggest that the correlation between the strength of corporatist consultation and concertation arrangements and party-group ties is likely to be positive rather than negative since relevant interest groups can use relations with political parties to secure reliable access and influence party decision-makers before and during corporatist negotiations. Moreover, because corporatism is arguably efficient at producing public policy outputs it probably makes parties, as organizers of government, more attractive targets in general, at the country-level. By using novel survey data on party-interest group ties in up to 19 mature democracies, we conduct the first systematic, cross-national analysis on the connection between the degree of corporatism and the strength of organizational ties between parties and trade unions as well as employers’ associations. Our results show that there is a positive association between institutionalized access to the state and party-group ties. This sheds new light on how the institutional framework parties and interest groups operate in, affects the interplay between these important intermediary organizations.	Parties and Representation

Groups possess expertise and information that can help parties develop more efficient and representative policies. But the information provided reflects the policy goals of the group and not the society as a whole. To compensate for this, a party needs input from several groups. But parties have limited capacity and must be selective about what groups they grant access to. The interest group literature on access has devoted little attention to parties. This paper adds to the literature by examining how party and policy specific factors affect the number and composition of groups a party grants access to in their decision-making processes. Building on theory of parties as rational goal-seeking actors, I theorize that parties will spend more time on policy areas that are important to them and thus grant access to more groups in these areas compared to others. Furthermore, parties will minimize the risk of public criticism and grant access to a more diverse set of groups in these policy areas. The hypotheses are tested by combining the PAIRDEM interest group survey dataset covering seven Western democracies with party salience data from the Manifesto Project. Multiple regression analysis controlling for country fixed effects, media salience and party size, show some support for the hypotheses. Parties grant access to more groups and gather more information on policy areas that are important to them. This implies that policies related to the areas the party prioritizes are the most well-grounded.	Parties and Representation

The role of intra-party politics on the ambiguity of electoral pledges.	743	Electoral pledges and their fulfilment cover an essential role in democratic systems and are highly relevant to the concept of political representation. Most studies define pledges as sentences that both show a commitment and are objectively “testable”. However, little attention has been paid to variations in the strength of commitments and consequently to the non-testable “soft” pledges: those that are ambiguous, vague and very general. Recent studies have shown how ambiguity of party platforms can be a rewarding electoral strategy and can be strategically used to balance the demands of the general electorate and party activists. We argue that the role of intra-party politics can be equally important in explaining the sources of ambiguity: adopting vague stances might result in fact from a failed compromise or an attempt to lessen conflict among factions within the party. This paper aims to test this argument by exploring how the degree of parties’ ideological heterogeneity influences the strength of commitments. The hypothesis is tested on a dataset including about 200 parties across 23 countries and 30 elections. Party ideological heterogeneity is operationalised through individual policy positions from elite survey data that enable analysis of elite-level party ideology and heterogeneity. To capture the strength of commitments, we focus on the degree of specificity of the electoral pledges included in party manifestos. Specificity is estimated using Speciteller, a text-analysis tool designed to detect ambiguity by scoring sentences from most general to most specific.	Parties and Representation

A growing number of studies analyze this phenomenon, although it is unclear whether and to whom parties are responsive. This paper discusses the different implications of the proximity and directional model of voting for parties' responsiveness to position shifts of the electorate. It argues that parties are responsive to the position of specific segments of the electorate that are more likely to vote for them, and does not respond to the median voter. Taking this into account, this paper analyzes and compares the responsiveness of parties to the median and the party voter. It relies on the unique setting of direct democracy in Switzerland to estimate the ideological position of the median voter, the party voter, and the different political parties over time. The paper uses a Bayesian Item Response Theory model to operationalize the ideological direction of ballot proposals and uses it to evaluate parties' responsiveness to the median and the party voter. The results show that parties are not responsive to the median voter's position but seem to follow the position of the party voter.	Parties and Representation

Measuring intra-party competition in OLPR systems	896	In open-list proportional representation (OLPR) systems, candidates must obtain personal votes to succeed. Hence, many analysts infer that intra-party competition during electoral campaigns is the norm in such systems: because they need to direct votes to themselves, candidates from the same party list would have to compete against one another for the votes their party receives, weakening, therefore, ties between voters and parties. This perspective neglects the roles parties play in organizing electoral contests. In this paper, we examine ways in which intra-party competition is mitigated in a context where parties are universally considered to play little or no role. Specifically, we investigate how parties compose their list of candidates to avoid geographic overlap among competitive candidates. We use a new dataset with election results at the level of the polling station for Brazilian elections between 2010-2018 and employ measures of spatial overlap to show that competition between members of the same party is mild, whereas it is intense among candidates from different parties. The paper highlights the importance of thinking of the multiple and varied roles parties play in elections, even in contexts where they are believed to be weak and close to irrelevant.

Various proposals of reform have been made to reinvigorate representation and political participation. This paper focuses on one aspect of that debate: finding an alternative to FPTP, which is the electoral rule most frequently used in single-member districts, but which is criticized, among others, for allowing only a limited expression of voters’ preferences. Many alternative rules have been suggested, such as Approval Voting, Majority Judgement, Range Voting, etc. The literature on these decision rules has concentrated on their formal properties. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how frequently these rules would lead to different outcomes in normal electoral settings. This paper improves our understanding of these rules by examining their mechanical effects. We start from data on voters’ party utilities from “real-world” settings, based mainly on CSES data. This allows simulating and comparing the outcomes of different electoral rules under a variety of distributions of voters’ party preferences. We then analyze how frequently they lead to different outcomes and identify the contextual characteristics that explain these differences. For the latter question, we focus on a number of party system or electorate’s characteristics, which have been highlighted in debates on challenges to representation (such as ideological polarization, party system fragmentation, or affective polarization).

One possible reason is that female and racial minority candidates are disadvantaged due to strategic voting in plurality/two-round runoff elections, as this system can incentivize voters to choose their second-best candidate — if they believe this candidate has a better chance of winning among the broader electorate — over their most preferred one in order to avoid an even less desirable election outcome. Ranked-choice voting (RCV) systems, by contrast, have the potential to lower the incentives for strategic voting because votes for low-performing candidates are not “wasted” but rather reallocated to better-performing candidates in a voter’s ranked list. Accordingly, we measure whether the introduction of RCV increases the chances that female and racial minority candidates win local elections. Specifically, we leverage the introduction of RCV for municipal elections in four Californian cities since 2004 to identify whether RCV has an effect on the electoral chances for minority candidates using difference in differences estimation. Preliminary results suggest that RCV has no effect on the electoral chances of female candidates, but it has a small positive effect on candidates from racial minorities. We further analyze the potential mechanisms for an effect such as changes in voter turnout and the size and characteristics of the pool of candidates following the introduction of RCV.

In addition, to examine the complex relationship between electoral rules and voter turnout, we exploit two recent reforms of the legal rules concerning local elections in Poland, implemented in 2011 and 2018. This allows us to use eg. regression discontinuity design and synthetic control approach in the research on the impact of electoral rules on voter turnout. Moreover, the data that we have collected enable us to move our study beyond the simplification of voting systems as “majoritarian vs. proportional”. While previous quasi-experimental studies have been limited to the electoral systems, which were not simple versions of SMDP or PR, the availability of district-level data for Polish local elections enables us to test the effect of electoral rules on turnout also for simple SMDP/FPTP and PR.

This paper focuses on one aspect of that debate: finding an alternative to FPTP, which is the electoral rule most frequently used in single-member districts, but which is criticized, among others, for allowing only a limited expression of voters’ preferences. Many alternative rules have been suggested, such as Approval Voting, Majority Judgement, Range Voting, etc. The literature on these decision rules has concentrated on their formal properties. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how frequently these rules would lead to different outcomes in normal electoral settings. This paper improves our understanding of these rules by examining their mechanical effects. We start from data on voters’ party utilities from “real-world” settings, based mainly on CSES data. This allows simulating and comparing the outcomes of different electoral rules under a variety of distributions of voters’ party preferences. We then analyze how frequently they lead to different outcomes and identify the contextual characteristics that explain these differences. For the latter question, we focus on a number of party system or electorate’s characteristics, which have been highlighted in debates on challenges to representation (such as ideological polarization, party system fragmentation, or affective polarization).

One possible reason is that female and racial minority candidates are disadvantaged due to strategic voting in plurality/two-round runoff elections, as this system can incentivize voters to choose their second-best candidate — if they believe this candidate has a better chance of winning among the broader electorate — over their most preferred one in order to avoid an even less desirable election outcome. Ranked-choice voting (RCV) systems, by contrast, have the potential to lower the incentives for strategic voting because votes for low-performing candidates are not “wasted” but rather reallocated to better-performing candidates in a voter’s ranked list. Accordingly, we measure whether the introduction of RCV increases the chances that female and racial minority candidates win local elections. Specifically, we leverage the introduction of RCV for municipal elections in four Californian cities since 2004 to identify whether RCV has an effect on the electoral chances for minority candidates using difference in differences estimation. Preliminary results suggest that RCV has no effect on the electoral chances of female candidates, but it has a small positive effect on candidates from racial minorities. We further analyze the potential mechanisms for an effect such as changes in voter turnout and the size and characteristics of the pool of candidates following the introduction of RCV.

Measuring intra-party competition in OLPR systems	896	In open-list proportional representation (OLPR) systems, candidates must obtain personal votes to succeed. Hence, many analysts infer that intra-party competition during electoral campaigns is the norm in such systems: because they need to direct votes to themselves, candidates from the same party list would have to compete against one another for the votes their party receives, weakening, therefore, ties between voters and parties. This perspective neglects the roles parties play in organizing electoral contests. In this paper, we examine ways in which intra-party competition is mitigated in a context where parties are universally considered to play little or no role. Specifically, we investigate how parties compose their list of candidates to avoid geographic overlap among competitive candidates. We use a new dataset with election results at the level of the polling station for Brazilian elections between 2010-2018 and employ measures of spatial overlap to show that competition between members of the same party is mild, whereas it is intense among candidates from different parties. The paper highlights the importance of thinking of the multiple and varied roles parties play in elections, even in contexts where they are believed to be weak and close to irrelevant.

There is an ongoing debate among practitioners and scholars about the drivers of parties’ policy positions. Yet, existing work has not, so far, fully taken into account the spatial interactions of party strategies. Current empirical efforts based on simple ordinary least squares fail to honor these complexities. This article addresses this shortcoming by examining how parties adjust their environmental positions in response to rival parties’ environmental strategies. In particular, I argue that parties are not affected by the strategies of all their competitors. Only green parties' electoral success pushes parties to emphasize environmental issues. Spatial-econometric analysis of parties’ election policies about the environment from European countries between 1980-2020 empirically establishes that among their competitors, only electorally successful green parties pressure parties to adapt environmental positions.

Evidence from a Field Experiment with Party Candidates	139	Modern societies face many important problems. Political parties and their politicians are required to address these problems and provide solutions. However, they have limited resources and need to make choices between problems. This raises the question which problems parties and their politicians pay attention to and why? We report from a pre-registered large-scale randomized field experiment conducted on a sample of more than 6,000 party candidates in the Danish local election in November 2021. Candidates randomly received an e-mail invitation to read a report about one of two societal problems (climate change and public schools) highlighting one of four content aspects (public opinion, party positions, media reporting, and statistical indicators). We estimate effects with an intention-to-treat analysis and our results show that party candidates are equally likely to engage with reports about statistical indicators and public opinion (about 27% of candidates in the two conditions). The level of problem attention in the remaining conditions featuring party positions and media reporting is -2.5 [95% CI: -5.6 to 0.6] and -3.6 [95% CI: -6.7 to -1.5] percentage points lower compared to the statistical indicator condition. We further show that the more obtrusive problem public schools increases attention by 3.7 [95% CI: 1.5 to 5.8] percentage points compared to climate change. We are currently scheduling interviews with candidates to get a deeper understanding of their attention to problems.

In particular, can moral rhetoric increase non-copartisans' favorability toward the party? Drawing insights from previous research on moral arguments and partisan bias, I argue that moral rhetoric is generally not persuasive, even among those who are morally aligned, and that moral rhetoric can further push away non-copartisans with pre-existing hostility toward the party. I use original survey experiments on representative samples from Britain to test my arguments. Consistent with expectation, I find that moral rhetoric does not easily persuade. Inconsistent with expectation, I find that moral rhetoric does not further alienate hostile non-copartisan voters. These findings suggest the limit as well as the potential of moral rhetoric as a form of party communication. The paper contributes to studies in party competition, moral psychology, and persuasion.

Yet political behaviour research often considers environmental attitudes as a component of a broader ‘second-dimension’ and either subsumes it into this or omits it. Using data from the 5th wave of the European Values Study, we demonstrate through factor analyses that environmentalism loads as a separate dimension across Western Europe, that environmentalism has somewhat different social predictors, and that it has important effects on party preference that differ from those of other second dimension issues. Our findings have crucial implications. Firstly, ignoring environmentalism in studies of political behaviour misses an important part of the picture. Secondly, subsuming environmentalism into a broader “cultural” dimension may lead to incomplete conclusions about both social predictors and the electoral consequences of political attitudes and values. Thus, allowing for a separate environmental dimension opens up novel perspectives on political representation in Western democracies.	Parties and Representation

Evidence from Germany and Switzerland	1158	The issue of climate change and how societies need to change the way they produce and use energy has come to the forefront of public interest in recent years. In this paper, we examine how the increasing salience of the climate change issue impacts party competition within multi-party parliamentary countries. We theorize that while the climate issue was owned by green parties before, by now it has been integrated into the traditional left-right policy dimension. As an empirical evidence, we present the results of a comparative survey experiment that we conducted in Germany and Switzerland. In this experiment, we examined how voters place parties on a scale after reading negative and positive statements on two regressive taxes: the carbon-tax and the Value Added Tax (VAT). We theorize that if the issue has been fully integrated into the economic issue dimension, the voters will place the parties similarly under all conditions. Conversely, if green parties own the issue voters will believe that they support the carbon tax no matter which condition they are in but not the other parties. We find, that while green parties still own green issues, left parties are placed much closer to the green parties when voters see positive statements about the carbon tax than otherwise. Right parties are placed farther away under this condition. We argue that this is because while left parties adopt green issues, right parties move away. Thus the environmental issue gets partly integrated into the economic issue dimension and it is polarizing.	Parties and Representation

Instead, school personnel and parents receive most of the credit (blame) for good (poor) performance. We also show that local politicians are keen to shift blame onto higher levels of government, but do not engage in government-opposition blame games at the local level. Taken together, our findings suggest that vertical blame shifting prevails over majority-opposition blame games in settings characterized by a political consensus culture.	Parties and Representation

Minority governments often enjoy the legislative support of external support parties which play an ambiguous role in politics: while they are formally part of the opposition, they are simultaneously committed to keeping the government in office and passing its bills. Scholars have theorized that external support parties choose this roles because it allows them to influence policy without suffering the electoral cost of governing. How does accountability work under such circumstances? And can that teach us something about accountability and retro-spective voting more generally? In this project, I hypothesize that voters who are satisfied with government performance will feel more positively towards and will be more likely to vote for parties that support the government. Using the new Parliamentary Governments in Europe Data (PAGED), I explore the responsibility attribution to and electoral consequences for informal and formal support parties as well as ""true"" opposition parties.

The Role of Issue Divergence in Voters’ Perceptions of Their Party System and its Implications	419	How do parties differentiate themselves from each other, and how does this differentiation affect voters? This paper argues that alongside the more traditional party-system characteristics like the number of parties and the degree of ideological polarization, parties and party systems also vary through issue divergence, the degree to which there is conflict over what the key issues in politics ought to be. Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, I demonstrate that voters perceive greater differences between parties when parties propose agendas that diverge with respect to issue emphasis. I then substantiate the practical relevance of these perceptions of party differences for voters by showing that respondents who perceive higher degrees of difference in their party system are likely to report higher levels of satisfaction with democracy and higher levels of electoral participation. These results contribute to our understanding of party systems and how they influence voter behavior.	Parties and Representation

Comparative evidence from a three-fold study	1198	While extensive evidence confirms that winning an election increases satisfaction with democracy (SWD), the evidence on the effect of entering parliament is scarce. This is surprising given the increasing impact of new parties in Western democracies. Not only are they more likely to irrupt parliament than ever before, but their voters also display lower levels of SWD and other indicators of democratic support. Do they become more supportive after their party breakthrough? This paper provides three complementary studies to answer this question. The first one leverages the quasi-as-random nature of seat assignment around legally fixed electoral thresholds to identify the effect of parliamentary entry on SWD. It exploits post-electoral survey data from the cumulative files of the CSES with administrative electoral records within a regression-discontinuity approach (RDD). The second study uses pre- and post-electoral waves from six European panels to compare changes in SWD among voters of new parties entering parliament barely above the threshold with those gaining a sizeable number of seats. While voters of minor new parties become more satisfied after the election, voters of major new parties do not. The third study exploits extensive panel data (n>8000) for an in-depth analysis of AfD voters during the 2017 German Federal election to provide insights into this seeming puzzle. This paper contributes to the extensive literature on the winner-loser gap in SWD. It also adds to the growing literature on party entry effects. Most importantly, it provides original insights on why party-system change might not foster democratic support.	Parties and Representation

In this paper, we analyze the consequences of the relative decrease of the IMF’s lending capabilities on member states’ decision to entrust their central banks with (stronger) powers as lenders of last resort (LOLR). While the IMF's absolute lending capacity is near historic highs, the growth of its lending capacity has not kept pace with financial globalization and potential liabilities of developing countries. We develop a formal model based on the beer-quiche game that shows that states with a reduced access to IMF lending capabilities should be associated with member states’ expansion of their central banks’ powers as to act as a LOLR – independently from the soundness of the countries’ financial systems, or their repayment reputations. We test our theory on a sample of developing countries between 1974 and 2014, using an original database of central banks LOLR capabilities. A battery of quantitative tests provides strong support for the empirical implications our theory. These findings suggest a substitution between domestic and global financial safety nets when access to IMF lending is reduced.

Weldzius (2021) suggests that global supply chain trade has contributed to the “end of currency manipulation” due to the decreased benefits of this beggar-thy-neighbor policy, but he does not address the transmission mechanism for the policy shift. In this paper, I address this transmission mechanism, arguing that intensified interdependence between countries has constrained the monetary policy choices of central banks, in particular, “nonhegemonic” central banks. These non-hegemonic central banks consider the impact of policy divergence from the hegemon in their regional trading bloc. The hegemon sets policy according to some exogenous rule, the outcome of which has spillover effects on the non-hegemons’ policy choices. The more interdepedence between the non-hegemon and hegemon, the more likely the non-hegemon converges on the hegemon’s monetary policy (cf. Bearce 2009). I test this theory by analyzing the central bank minutes and policy reports of 34 central banks in four regional trading blocs (North America, South America, Europe, and East/Southeast Asia) between 2000 and 2020. Using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, I measure how much non-hegemonic central banks are influenced by the monetary policy set by their regional hegemon (ECB, Fed, BoJ, and PBOC), conditional on the intensity of economic interdependence measured as global supply chain integration. I will support the quantitative analyses with three case studies of Argentina, Switzerland, and Thailand.	International Relations and Conflict

The existing literature describes these pressures as originating from competition for capital among countries, and suggests convergence on a core set of policies relevant to foreign investors. We argue that the pressures from financial globalization are driven by credit conditions in the U.S., which transmit to domestic credit markets in other countries; and that these pressures extend to a much broader set of business-friendly policies, because governments use such policies to compensate domestic firms for higher borrowing costs when credit conditions tighten. We provide evidence for our argument using party manifestos from 59 countries between 1962-2017. Our paper documents a new link between global capital cycles and parties’ policy positions and suggests a mechanism connecting financial markets and global convergence to business-friendly politics.

The recognition that failed states do sometimes experience state consolidation suggests, in line with a growing body of work at the interstate level, that a balance of power system is not an effective guarantee against one actor dominating the others. At the same time, balance of power dynamics complicate efforts to consolidate authority in weak states, and help to explain persistent violence. We thus argue that balance of power dynamics constitute a central challenge for state consolidation, but not an insurmountable one. We construct a game-theoretic model of balance of power politics in which a set of secondary actors must choose whether to align with a dominant actor. If enough actors support the leader, political consolidation occurs around the leader; otherwise, a contest ensues that both allocates spoils to the winners and has the potential to unseat the leader. In this environment, either state consolidation or persistent balance of power politics can emerge in equilibrium. Moreover, we show that, independent of the material environment, state consolidation is more likely when secondary actors jointly believe it more likely. This result suggests that aspirants for state consolidation will have an incentive to adopt risky strategies that may produce dramatic victories, which in turn could precipitate a tipping process in which secondary actors rally to their side. We illustrate the logic of this argument with reference to politics in Afghanistan.	International Relations and Conflict

The various causes and consequences of these walls is hardly studied in a systematic way. This paper seeks to fill this gap by examining the effects of constructing these walls have on leaders’ tenure. My theoretical point of departure is the Selectorate Theory that was introduced by Bueno de Mesquita et al (2003). The theory stipulates that states’ policy choices are shaped by leaders’ motivation to stay in power and the institutional framework within the country. Assuming that leaders will do everything they can to stay in power, they will also build walls – as one policy option at their disposal - if they think it as beneficial to surviving in power. Hence, using this as a political tool should prolong their tenure, or help their re-election bid, whenever relevant. This should be more pronounced the more democratic a country is. This paper attempts to test this link by using the Carter and Poast’s dataset of all border walls 1800-2014.	International Relations and Conflict

Most existing research has analyzed what factors affect natives' opinions on accepting refugees to the country. However, our understanding of preferences for refugee settlement (e.g., refugees living in camps or spreading across the country) is limited. It is critical to examine whether natives prefer refugees to live in closed camps at the border or spread across the country as this has implications for refugees’ integration as well as the host country’s social dynamics. Focusing on host countries experiencing civil conflict and political tension, this study emphasizes the role of security concerns and suggests that depending on refugees' relationship to the minority group and insurgency in the destination, preferences for refugee settlement vary. It analyzes factors that affect natives’ opinions on refugee settlement through a conjoint experiment in Turkey. The results highlight the importance of security concerns and cultural concerns. Additionally, the analysis reveals that preferences for refugee settlement are quite stable and refugee attributes have limited impact. Further examinations suggest that while those who have pro-refugee attitudes prefer refugees spreading across the country, those who have negative attitudes prefer refugees in border camps. This study contributes to the literature by underscoring the role of security concerns and highlighting the stability of attitudes toward refugee settlement.	International Relations and Conflict

Sectorial trade dominance in WTO trade disputes	766	Scholars have been widely studying political and economic determinants of WTO dispute settlement participation since its initiation in 1995. Yet, the role of sectorial trade dominance and bilateral sectorial trade in WTO trade disputes and retaliation cases remains unclear. Extending previous theories to link dispute settlement initiation and the role of trade, I first argue that trade disputes aim to protect domestic industries against breaches of international trade agreements which leads to a higher likelihood of dispute initiation when sectorial trade is larger. Building on the role of bilateral trade balances, I then claim that the existence of sectorial trade dependencies combined with trade harming policies is perceived as a systemic threat and thus governments initiate more trade dispute cases. I test these assumptions in a quantitative, large-N regression framework using panel and dyadic data from 1995 to 2019. I employ sectorial trade data from CEPII for over 100 countries and newly aggregated data on WTO dispute settlement performance. Promising results support the argument that higher sectoral trade as well as larger bilateral import and export shares increase the probability of initiating a WTO trade dispute. Moreover, these results also persist for the trade dispute cases that reach the final stage of authorization to suspend concessions and retaliate. These findings suggest that complaint parties initiate more trade disputes when strategic trade sectors are harmed by foreign country’s breaches of international trade agreements.

On the Trade Diversion Effects from Civil Conflict.	374	We develop a novel estimation approach to consider political or economic shocks from third countries in bilateral trade relationships and estimate heterogeneous and persistent trade diversion effects caused by civil conflicts. Our estimation approach is derived from the structural gravity model of international trade and translates the triadic relationship between a conflict country and an exporter-importer pair into an estimable dyadic relationship. Our results indicate that importers divert trade flows from conflict countries to alternative export partners in the agricultural, manufacturing and minerals sectors, but not in the fuels sector. We further find that this trade diversion effect is persistent after civil conflicts resolve, and that trade diversion fosters market integration via RTAs among affected dyads. Our heterogeneity analysis emphasizes that firms with highly integrated supply chains are less likely to divert shipments and that diversion takes place immediately in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, but only after long conflict spells in the minerals sector. Finally, we conduct a general equilibrium welfare analysis based on three case studies and find that civil conflicts lead to net welfare losses for all (indirectly) affected countries, even those exporters to whom trade flows get diverted. Our findings add to the discussion of the persistent economic costs of civil conflict. Finally, our estimation approach can be adapted to other frameworks where unilateral political or economic shocks in one country may affect the bilateral relationship between other countries.

A Multilevel-Network Model of Joint Negotiations and Preferential Trade Agreements'	599	When do collective interests trump strategic interests when it comes to negotiating preferential trade agreements (PTAs)? The number of regional integration organisations vastly increased in the aftermath of the cold war. Moreover, an ever growing number of states negotiate and sign PTAs with third parties as a single group, representing a common interest. While depth of integration clearly defines the political space in which states navigate, an increasing number of moderately integrated groups of states decide to jointly negotiate trade agreements, without any prejudice to member states' rights to negotiate bilateral agreements. For many states, this offers new opportunities as they face the choice whether to negotiate agreements individually or as part of a larger group.This paper employs novel quantitative methods and network analysis in order to analyse (i) the political and economic benefits and costs of negotiating as a group as well as (ii) the conditions under which certain states decide to go alone, rather than being part of a (potential) coalition. Using multilevel-network models, the relevance of trade relationships and previous trade agreements both on international and regional level is scrutinized in a large-N analysis. This approach takes into account possible spill over effects of agreements signed by single member states of regional IOs as well as network effects influencing the choices of potential accession candidates to IOs. A number of interviews with trade representatives and negotiators shed light on the rationale of the decision between individual and group negotiations.	International Relations and Conflict

We study patterns in decisions made by the US International Trade Administration and International Trade Commission to introduce a novel source of privileged treatment. We argue that the position of a firm within the economy is a key determinant of successful petitions: more ‘central’ firms, which draw on a more diverse set of inputs and which have more links throughout the domestic economy, enjoy a privileged political position, because benefits to these firms extend indirectly to a broader set of constituents. To test this argument, we use firm-level data from ORBIS and data from the Global Antidumping Database, and match it with data on linkages between firms in the domestic economy. We provide evidence that more ‘central’ firms are more likely to see their petition accepted.

At its core, the years 1989/90 brought two new systems to Eastern Europe: capitalism and democracy. Yet, thirty years later, Eastern Europe shows feeble democratic institutions and imperfect market economies. What explains this unsuccessful transformation? This paper points to the rushed marketization of East European economies in the early 1990s as a key explanation for citizens low support for democracy and capitalism. Using micro-level data from East Germany, we find that firm privatizations led to a marked resurgence of the former Socialist Unity Party. We argue that this effect is likely due to perceived cronyism. Socialist voting thrived whenever firms were sold to Western elites. The exclusion of East Germans belied the narrative that capitalism is meritocratic, thus sowing mistrust toward the new regime at large.	Political Economy

Despite the controversies opened in the last years regarding the legacy of the Spanish transition for the continuity of many Francoist political and economic elites during the democratic period, there has been no systematic study on to what extent Francoist elites remained in power nor on the factors explaining elite reproducibility under distinct regimes. In this paper, we present a new dataset to measure the renewal of elites in the Spanish transition called the ""Spanish Transition dataset."" Our dataset contains more than 500 profiles of the main economic and political figures of late Francoism as well as the leaders of the main opposition forces and those leading the Transition to democracy.

Theories of elite-led democratization have shown that when facing a situation of deep social unrest, repression is more likely in cases of high social inequality. However, many contemporary autocratic regimes are able to conciliate low levels of inequality and their autocratic features. This paper offers an innovative answer to the question of under what circumstances is elite-led democratization more attractive.Using data for 188 autocratic regimes between 1945 and 2015, this article provides strong empirical evidence that economic clout — defined as the extent of economic influence over the international community by an autocratic regime — is a crucial factor in the autocrat’s decision to democratize. Employing a staggered Difference-in-Differences design, I empirically show that high levels of economic clout (HEC) increase democratization costs, making repression the cheapest and most attractive choice. The mechanism is twofold: (i) HEC makes extractive activity more attractive for the incumbent in power as these regimes allow for more extraction. (ii) Most importantly, the existence of HEC will prompt international trade partners to not pressure the regime to democratize in order to keep the favorable economic status quo, in order to keep benefiting from the economic gains from trade with the autocracy. In non-HEC regimes, the costs of repression will be higher since international pressure to democratize will be more pronounced, prompting the autocrat to democratize instead of investing in repression.

Using micro-level data from East Germany, we find that firm privatizations led to a marked resurgence of the former Socialist Unity Party. We argue that this effect is likely due to perceived cronyism. Socialist voting thrived whenever firms were sold to Western elites.

While most nations have one or two offices on each ballot, localities within the United States can present voters with a dozen or more. Prior experimental and observational evidence demonstrates that when people face a greater number of political decision tasks they tend to focus on the perceived “most important tasks first,” putting greater effort into that decision and seek out the most information about that decision. Politically, this tends to result on a focus on presidential or gubernatorial races, at the expense of congressional and lower races(Andersen 2011). Voters focus on the top-of-the-ticket and rely on partisanship to guide lower decisions, and then exaggerate their perceptions of lower tier candidates that they learn less about. This study uses a unique 10-day campaign simulation that permits a more fine-grained analysis of how exactly subjects cope with the learning demands of multiple office races being contested simultaneously. By experimentally manipulating the number of offices subjects see, and the positions and personalities those candidates project, this project seeks to better map how voters seek out information about the various contests they can view, what information they pursue about the various candidates, and how the various pieces of information affect their evaluations of and decision to vote for office candidates.

The Electoral Impact of Candidate Selection	993	The effect of party cohesion on voter choice is a common wisdom in electoral studies. This is also the argument party elites use to justify the existence of a single candidate for the post of party leader (normally referred as “coronations”). However the electoral consequences of competitive leadership selection events remain under-studied. Do candidates elected in primaries perform better? Or are primaries desired but also perceived by voters as a signal of an intra-party lack of cohesion? In this paper we want to assess the electoral impact of competitive leadership selection. We use an original dataset of leadership selection events at the regional level for the main parties in Canada, Germany and Spain since the early 1990s. In addition, we employ an experimental design to examine the effect of different intra-party selection procedures on vote choice. Our design also allows us to analyze why voters punish or reward candidates elected via different intra-party mechanisms.	Behaviour and Opinion

A wealth of literature has tried to answer this question relying on intrinsic motivations. A smaller body of literature has focused the role of extrinsic motivations such as social norms. This literature has argued that perceptions of what others deem acceptable is an important factor determining the preferences individuals develop and their willingness to express them. This literature has two main shortcomings. First, it lacks a broader theory as to which political platforms are stigmatized and why. Second, there is no real-world evidence that individuals self-censor counter-normative preferences. This paper aims to overcome these shortcomings. Theoretically, I argue that there are two political platforms that are likely to be stigmatized in advanced industrial democracies: successor parties in post-authoritarian countries and radical- right parties. Empirically, I exploit the peculiar the Spanish voting procedure that makes individuals vote in a way that is observable to others. I exploit variation in this level of ""publicness"" of voting choices to provide real-world evidence that individuals self-censor preferences for successor parties and radical-right parties. The findings will highlight the role of peer pressure and self-regulation in inhibiting behavior at odds with democratic values.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, we argue that voters’ reaction to the policies are conditional on the actor implementing them. Voters have different expectations towards political parties regarding the policies they are expected to implement, and subverted expectations can have electoral consequences. This is particularly the case when they are related to issues central to the party’s ideological agenda. We supply experimental evidence of this in the case of social-democratic austerity policies: Left-wing voters punish social democrats much more for implementing such policies than they punish a mainstream right party for the same actions. Our findings have important implications for several ongoing debates in the literature such as the demise of social democratic parties in the wake of the Great Recession, the interplay between parties and citizens, as well as the general effect of austerity on electoral outcomes.

While research on the reasons why pledges are (not) fulfilled has been growing in the last couple of years, voters' reactions to government pledge fulfilment is still understudied. Previous research on citizens' retrospectively oriented reactions has mainly focused on studying the effects of a government's performance (sociotropic or egocentric) unrelated to election pledges. While there is initial evidence that voters punish governments for breaking their pledges, we still lack knowledge to which kind of pledges voters respond in a positive or negative way. We acknowledge the growing importance of group targeting and mobilization, i.e., the fact that parties make election pledges addressing specific groups of voters positively or negatively, such as business owners or migrants. We argue that two factors affect how voters react to the fulfilment of targeted election pledges: 1) their perceived deservingness of the target group and 2) their individual belonging to that group. To assess how voters respond to group targeted pledge (non-)fulfilment, we rely on a survey experiment based on real broken or fulfilled election pledges conducted during the election campaign for the 2021 legislative elections in Germany and for the 2022 presidential election in France (N = 12,000).

We primarily rely on dynamic panel models, but the results are robust to different estimation techniques such as 1-way or 2-way fixed effects models.	Behaviour and Opinion

This relationship is a cornerstone in democratic societies because otherwise political elites become untethered from the public they are supposed to serve. Yet as much as this model of accountability is normatively desirable, research from the last decades show that if people like their leaders, then they tend to approve of all sorts of performances. That is, the relationship runs opposite of the traditional model. Such findings are often attributed to the string of tendencies that underpin directional motivated reasoning. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between institutional trust and performance evaluations of the institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on a multi-wave panel data with over 10,000 Swedish respondents, we show that there is a reciprocal relationship between evaluations of how the institutions handled the pandemic and institutional trust.

While research on the reasons why pledges are (not) fulfilled has been growing in the last couple of years, voters' reactions to government pledge fulfilment is still understudied. Previous research on citizens' retrospectively oriented reactions has mainly focused on studying the effects of a government's performance (sociotropic or egocentric) unrelated to election pledges. While there is initial evidence that voters punish governments for breaking their pledges, we still lack knowledge to which kind of pledges voters respond in a positive or negative way. We acknowledge the growing importance of group targeting and mobilization, i.e., the fact that parties make election pledges addressing specific groups of voters positively or negatively, such as business owners or migrants. We argue that two factors affect how voters react to the fulfilment of targeted election pledges: 1) their perceived deservingness of the target group and 2) their individual belonging to that group. To assess how voters respond to group targeted pledge (non-)fulfilment, we rely on a survey experiment based on real broken or fulfilled election pledges conducted during the election campaign for the 2021 legislative elections in Germany and for the 2022 presidential election in France (N = 12,000). We study voters’ reactions at different levels: specific support (performance evaluation of government and voting) as well as diffuse support (political trust and democratic satisfaction). The findings of this study have major implications for our understanding of promissory representation, group politics and policy feedbacks.	Behaviour and Opinion

We theorize that terrorism works, but for its supporters rather than for the terrorists themselves. Because supporters are willing to contribute resources to a terrorist organization, thereby increasing the terrorist organization's ability to launch attacks, this will coerce the targeted government to revise its policies in accordance with the supporters' preferences. Targeted governments respond with concessions in order to erode support and thereby render the terrorists easier to defeat. Support can be rational even when, as is empirically likely, supporters' ideal policies are closer to those of the government than to those of the terrorists. We examine six campaigns generally regarded as unambiguous failures of terrorism. For each, we show that governments made concessions that placated the supporters but not the terrorists, and that this was followed by successful suppression of the weakened terrorists.	Formal Models

Whereas traditional models consider interactions that end in either war or a peaceful bargain, we assume actors can also engage in low-level, costly policy options that shape final political outcomes in their favor (e.g., sanctions, airstrikes, cyberattacks). We analyze this new class of models using the tools of mechanism design. In contrast with standard monotonicity results in crisis bargaining models, we identify general conditions under which a greater private willingness to fight is associated with a lower probability of war or expected utility from settlement. Theoretically, our results identify when including multiple conflict options breaks key tenants regarding the role of private information in conflict. Substantively, our results suggest that improving specific conflict capabilities can perversely lead to more war or worse outcomes for the state making the improvements.	Formal Models

To address these questions, I analyze a formal model of tactical choice by the leadership of a dissident group and endogenous mobilization of citizens. I show that violent and nonviolent tactics are chosen in very different circumstances. Nonviolence is relatively more effective and is more likely when citizens have strong incentives to mobilize due to high grievances but expec! t to face low repression. Violence is relatively more effective when citizens face weak incentives to mobilize, either due to low grievances or high repression. Therefore, the conditions under which nonviolent tactics are preferred are also the conditions under which both tactics are more effective. Further, groups can change focus from nonviolence to violence in the face of increased repression, and counterintuitively, they can also shift from violence to nonviolence as grievances are exacerbated.

How can an autocrat ensure that this organization does in fact repress his opponents? And in what circumstances does the secret police defect and refuse to repress the opposition? I present a dynamic model where an autocrat is threatened by a mass opposition movement and uses the secret police to repress it. I examine the conditions under which secret police agents will repress even when they have no interest in the survival of the autocratic regime. I then examine how the interaction with opposition activists may affect the agents’ decision to repress, and how the opposition may choose tactics to make the secret police’s defection more likely.

The third party faces a dilemma: while the threat of intervention might reduce the autocrat's investment in repression, this might produce political instability and possibly more repression against civilians. By maintaining repression relatively low via the threat of intervention, a third party animated by humanitarian concerns de facto increases the vulnerability of the autocrat to domestic challenges. When domestic challenges can lead to a power vacuum and prolonged internal conflict, we show that citizens would benefit from the presence of a third party less committed to preventing repression, and more concerned about political stability. By tolerating a higher level of repression, a third party primarily concerned about political stability can limit the possibility of prolonged internal conflicts and ultimately ensure a lower level of repression against civilians.

Yet, so far, the literature has focused on the individual use of this procedure only, and MEPs’ patterns of co-sponsorship of written questions remain understudied. This paper fills this gap and investigates why MEPs unite forces to table questions collectively. Furthermore, it sheds light on the rationales of MEPs to draw attention to specific policy issues in their group questions. Building on the theories of legislative organization, I formulate hypotheses on the role of specialization, nationality, and partisan affiliation for MEPs’ co-sponsorship of written questions. I further argue that MEPs who represent different national and partisan interests are likely to table questions together if the policy issue that they ask about is salient for their national parties and publics. To test the argument, I rely on the original dataset of all group written questions addressed by MEPs to the European Commission and the Council in the period 2009-2019 as well as on the Euromanifesto study and Eurobarometer opinion polls. This paper contributes to our understanding of EU agenda formation, informal coalition-building and legislative networks in the European Parliament, and MEPs’ representation of public and partisan issue priorities.

As members of either the government or opposition, their role in proposing, supporting or opposing policy seems to be set. However, there are instances in which individual members work together on legislation across party lines. While this behavior might seem irrational from a party unity perspective, I propose three mechanisms that might explain it. First, as MPs see themselves as surrogate representatives of social groups, they might be motivated to work together with other members of those groups on legislation. Second, candidate-centred electoral systems might motivate MPs to look for collaboration along geographic or policy lines rather than within party. Third, situations that weaken the government parties' cohesiveness, such as minority governments, oversized majorities and ideologically broad coalitions might lead to MPs looking for policy outside their party. I test these mechanisms using a dataset of bill cosponsorships in 14 European countries between 1990 and 2020.	Legislative Studies

To answer this question, we first analyze the CSES data that cover over 40 elections in Western Europe since 1996.

We then study what parties benefit from strategic voting overall, and across electoral systems and districts magnitudes. Second, to explore further the mechanisms at stake, we analyze data from lab experimental elections in the UK and France. The key advantage of this method is that the elections are conducted in an abstract context in which the left-right ideology of subjects (measured in a post-experiment survey) is by design uncorrelated with their strategic incentives in the lab elections. Hence, we can assess whether rightwing and leftwing subjects inherently behave differently when it comes to casting a strategic vote.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, such quotas and their institutional design are also subject to intense public debate. Surprisingly, research on citizens' preferences towards legislative gender quotas only have been rarely analyzed so far.This paper thus asks the question of which factors affect public preferences towards gender quotas. We answer this question based on a combination of experimental treatments as well as observational factors included in a large scale survey among 2500 respondents in Germany. We make use of a vignette experiment, where we provide the respondents with a varying degree of information on certain gender-quota related factors. Respondents for example receive information on the impact of the electoral system on the probability of being elected as a candidate or the effect of gender quotas on substantive representation of women. Our findings demonstrate that gender quotas are highly polarized among the public, and that informing respondents about various factors as well as consequences associated with the introduction of gender quotas has no effect on public preferences. In contrast, we find that ideological position and the gender of a respondent are relevant predictors for gender quota support.	Behaviour and Opinion

Do they consider programmatic positions, valence issues, the opinion of transnational actors and experts, the candidates’ past, or their views on democracy? This paper aims to explore the operating mechanisms of vote choice in presidential elections in problematic democracies. It disentangles the role of candidates’ policy positions, personal histories, approval by domestic and external political actors, as well as sociodemographic attributes. The paper argues that different candidate attributes matter to different types of voters, and the key voter moderator is their cultural liberalism. Culturally more liberal voters are more likely to make electoral choices based on the democratic credentials of candidates. Simultaneously, candidate programs matter when they are congruous with the liberal-conservative outlooks of voters. The empirical analyses combine a conjoint experiment in the Czech Republic with an analysis of survey data from presidential elections in Central and Eastern Europe.

Observational and experiment evidence of the psychological partisan effect of electoral systems	438	Majoritarian electoral systems as well as proportional systems with small districts give an advantage to rightwing parties in the translation of votes into seats because these parties are more popular in rural areas where, under those systems, voters tend to be over-represented in parliament. We do not know however is the role that voters play in this relationship. Do they amplify the mechanical partisan effect of the electoral system or tone them down? To answer this question, we first analyze the CSES data that cover over 40 elections in Western Europe since 1996. We construct a measure of strategic voting by merging individual-level survey data with district-level electoral data. We then study what parties benefit from strategic voting overall, and across electoral systems and districts magnitudes. Second, to explore further the mechanisms at stake, we analyze data from lab experimental elections in the UK and France. The key advantage of this method is that the elections are conducted in an abstract context in which the left-right ideology of subjects (measured in a post-experiment survey) is by design uncorrelated with their strategic incentives in the lab elections. Hence, we can assess whether rightwing and leftwing subjects inherently behave differently when it comes to casting a strategic vote.	Behaviour and Opinion

In recent years this has only strengthened. A more interesting question is now what it takes to drive partisans away from their preferred party’s candidate. In this study, we test the limits of partisan loyalty by presenting research subjects with political candidates who deviate from partisan expectations in both policy and behavior. These deviations come in two forms, policy incongruence with their party’s typical stances on prominent issues and moral failures, in the form of being caught in one of four possible scandals. We use two experimental designs, a conjoint study and a dynamic process tracing simulation and find similar results in both. We find that partisans respond to deviant candidates by decreasing their liking for those candidates but still remaining loyal behaviorally in most cases. At the extreme, when candidates both deviate in policy and experience scandal subjects become more likely to abstain from voting than defect. Only in our most extreme condition did subjects become more likely to defect to the out-party candidate rather than vote for their in-party candidate.	Behaviour and Opinion

Theories of voting distinguish between instrumental and expressive motives behind voting behavior, but their long-term partisan implications remain largely ignored. We delve into this question by focusing on a rare instance of expressive voting: support for the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in the 1984 EP election, marked by the death of PCI’s charismatic leader, Enrico Berlinguer, only six days prior to the poll day. PCI became the most voted party, for the first time in its history. Are voters exposed to this event are more loyal to the party? If so, did such effect persist after PCI dismissed its brand?Using the difference in the vote share for PCI between 1979 and 1984, we obtain a municipal measure of empathy-based support for the party. We find that the change in PCI votes predicts future vote for the left, even after PCI is dismantled in 1991. We also instrument vote for Berlinguer in 1984 through the district (Lazio, Marche, Tuscany and Umbria) in which he ran both in 79 and 84 (i.e. after his death). People in this area had an additional motivation to vote for PCI, i.e. to actually cast a ballot for the deceased leader. Using such distinction as an instrument for ""Berlinguer vote"", we find that empathic vote generates a long-term loyalty to the left.

Re-Assessing Spatial Theory	116	Spatial models of vote choice devise actors to be risk-averse. Voters are supposed to be repelled by unclarity about political platforms and/ or by uncertainty about the ideological or programmatic positions of candidates and parties. This analysis builds upon a series of survey experiments so as to explore vote choice under certainty, risk, and ambiguity. Our findings reveal that risky alternatives, when electoral platforms are unclear, but potential outcomes and their respective probabilities are common knowledge, neither repel nor attract voters. In contrast, voters are driven away by uncertainty, when both outcomes and the probabilities of potential outcomes are unknown. Ultimately, we consider both experimental evidence and observational data from a voter survey to concomitantly address the internal and external validity of our research. In this paper, we present a series of survey experiments that focus on voter uncertainty about spatial party positions. In turn, we link experimental findings with observational evidence on German Bundestag elections. This enables us to apply internal consistency and validity derived within an experimental setting to a real-world electoral scenario so as to address both internal and external validity.

This trend is particularly observable in multi-party systems. One under-researched dimension of this phenomenon is the impact of ambivalent political attitudes. Ambivalent voters who simultaneously hold positive attitudes toward more than one political party or leader may be particularly inclined to switch parties between elections. A closely related question, then, is how voters become politically ambivalent. To understand the underlying causes, this paper focuses on two paths of explaining how voters' considerations sets can become larger and thereby increase the likelihood of developing ambivalent attitudes. The first path addresses ideological distances between parties. It is argued that an increasing number of parties leads to ideological convergence among some parties. As a result, the overlap in policy content becomes greater and certain parties appear more similar. Comparing the positions of these parties would therefore not reveal too many differences from which a decision could be derived. The second path deals with tradeoffs between (1) a favorite party and a potential coalition partner and (2) a party and its leader. For example, a voter may be conflicted if she clearly prefers a party but disagrees with a potential coalition partner, or if her preferred party disagrees with her preferred candidate/leader. While both pathways are mainly relevant for multi-party systems, they also apply to some extent to two-party systems. For the empirical analysis, data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) and the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) are used.	Behaviour and Opinion

Governments often face the challenge of implementing policies that are unpopular among affected local communities such as the establishment of wind parks or the phase-out of coal mines. However, little is known about how governments can ensure local support to successfully enact such unpopular policies. We argue that local communities are likely to support these policies when they perceive them to be economically beneficial.

More specifically, we study the effects of nuclear power plants on voting for the Green Party in Germany, a strong opponent of nuclear energy.

We examine the political effects of a severe flood that occurred shortly before the 2021 German federal election. Drawing on more than 500,000 survey responses and a panel of electoral returns, we assess how flood exposure affected (i) the issue salience of climate change, (ii) self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting in federal elections. The flood did not have a major impact on either of these three outcomes. Even in areas that suffered catastrophic destruction, the Green Party only saw small electoral gains. To explain this, we discuss two mechanisms: first, disaster exposure may not change preferences when climate change denial is rare, and the majority of voters already view climate change as a serious issue. Second, severe disasters could induce risk aversion among constituents and therefore decrease the propensity to vote for challenger parties. Our results suggest that the increasing frequency of natural disasters may not translate into political support for climate change policies.	Behaviour and Opinion

This study explores whether policy stances of MP candidates are affected by random variation in local yearly weather. We find negative relationship between how important matter climate change is for Finnish MP candidates and yearly deviation in local snow fall. Snow fall is a salient weather measure and local yearly deviation are random thus establishing a causal link. We use election advice application data, where candidates answer set of policy questions on a scale before the election, of Finnish MP candidates in order to get a measure of climate change (policy) attitudes. In order to explore the mechanism behind, we exploit the fact that in Finland election constituencies are geographically large, meaning voters and candidates do not necessarily share the same local climate. Using mean snow fall deviation of candidate’s voters, weighted by the share of candidates votes she got from the municipality, we find that the coefficient for candidate’s home municipality weather becomes insignificant whereas the coefficient for mean weighted weather of voters stays negative and significant. This suggests that candidate react to the voters, not the weather they experience themselves, when forming their climate change policy stances.	Behaviour and Opinion

We examine the political effects of a severe flood that occurred shortly before the 2021 German federal election. Drawing on more than 500,000 survey responses and a panel of electoral returns, we assess how flood exposure affected (i) the issue salience of climate change, (ii) self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting in federal elections. The flood did not have a major impact on either of these three outcomes. Even in areas that suffered catastrophic destruction, the Green Party only saw small electoral gains. To explain this, we discuss two mechanisms: first, disaster exposure may not change preferences when climate change denial is rare, and the majority of voters already view climate change as a serious issue. Second, severe disasters could induce risk aversion among constituents and therefore decrease the propensity to vote for challenger parties. Our results suggest that the increasing frequency of natural disasters may not translate into political support for climate change policies.	Behaviour and Opinion

Evidence from natural disasters	312	Do parties listen to their voters? A major challenge of studying party responsiveness is the interdependence between parties and voters. There may be congruence between parties and voters as parties may have responded to voters, but political parties may have also primed voters in the first place. In this study, we aim to overcome this challenge by exploiting exogenous variation in public opinion. More specifically, we leverage a novel dataset on natural disasters which produce exogenous variation in the salience of environmental issues to voters. We combine this dataset with a newly compiled dataset comprising more than 250,000 press releases from 68 parties across 9 countries between 2010 and 2019. Using supervised learning algorithms, we study party responsiveness dynamically by estimating a dynamic measure of parties’ monthly issue attention to environmental issues. Employing a causal identification strategy leveraging the exogenous nature of natural disasters, we show that there is substantial heterogeneity in how parties react to these exogenous shocks.

Previous research has extensively examined the formation of minority governments, and political scientists have long debated their performance indicating that minority governments may perform quite as well, sometimes even better, than majority governments. However, beyond these scholarly debates, we do not know much about what citizens think about minority governments. How do citizens evaluate minority and majority governments? Under which conditions do citizens prefer the formation of minority governments? We argue that citizens’ evaluations are influenced by cues from public opinion, their strategic self-interest and their political flexibility. Accordingly, citizens are more likely to support their formation when public support for minority governments is high and when it secures greater policy influence of one’s preferred party. Moreover, the less a citizen is attached to a specific party or party bloc, the more she prefers minority governments. These hypotheses are tested based on a two-round conjoint survey experiment in Germany we conducted in the run-up to the general election in 2021 (N = 2.750). Germany is a particular interesting case, since two-party majority coalitions were long time the norm. Increasing political fragmentation, however, now requires alternative forms of majority formation. Minority governments and flexible majorities, hence, attract increasing public attention. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of different types of government and their perceived political legitimacy, especially in political contexts facing party fragmentation.

What considerations shape citizen’s view of this dilemma inherent to multiparty parliamentarism? Do they want political parties to seek as much influence as possible or do they rather prefer parties to stay closely to their own position though it may imply limited political influence? Previous research has shown that when asked about compromise generally and in the abstract, citizens tend to prefer parties that are willing and able to compromise, but it remains unclear whether this extends to a less abstract context with inherent trade-offs and whether this preference is strong enough to impact actual vote choice. Furthermore, theories of coalition-directed strategic voting suggest that citizens are primarily concerned about maximizing the changes of their preferred government. If citizens expected parties to commit to their prime minister preference ahead of the election, this prevents parties from being open towards different coalition formations and can potentially severely undermine their bargaining position. Do citizens wish to constrain the parties in this way or do they trust their party of choice to reach the best deal possible? Using conjoint analysis, we test how voters handle trade-offs between ideological proximity, prime ministerial endorsements, willingness to compromise, and the party's prospects of passing the electoral treshold.

The ability of voters to assign responsibility for outcomes is of high relevance for the democratic function of parliamentary elections but remains poorly understood. According to existing observational studies voters rely heavily on a party's control over the office of prime minister, as an informational shortcut to identify the agenda-setter within a coalition government, and assign responsibility. Yet, there exists little theory and evidence on the effect of institutional prime ministerial powers and their usage on the role of prime ministers as informational shortcut for voters. This manuscript lays out a research design to causally identify responsibility assignment among coalition parties under different prime ministerial power contexts. It employs a vignette experiment in varying contexts of prime ministerial powers and makes use of a scheduled transition of the office of prime minister between coalition parties as a natural experiment. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of how prime ministerial behaviour and powers can affect electoral accountability in coalition governments.

Yet, existing policy-driven theories of coalition formation struggle to explain the inclusion of parties that do not easily fit onto a common policy dimension, and especially parties that do not express positions on the main issue dimension. Addressing this gap, I theorize the role of parties’ group appeals in the process of coalition formation and test it empirically. Specifically, I hypothesize that among non-formateur parties, those with more limited group appeals are more likely to be included in coalitions than parties with more extensive group appeals. I argue that that is so because a more limited group appeal is assumed to lead to more specific demands (for the groups these parties claim to represent) instead of broad-based demands. More limited group appeals make inclusion in coalitions less costly as it is easier to accommodate in a variety of minimum winning connected coalitions. Using a novel dataset of group appeals based on the content analysis of parties’ election manifestos, I examine 92 coalitions in Israel and the Netherlands between 1977 and 2015. The logistic regression analysis results, with parties being the unit of focus, support the hypothesis and show that among non-formateur parties, more limited group appeals increase the likelihood of being included in coalitions. These results highlight the importance of including this variable in our analysis of coalition formation and the value of using different sources to examine parties’ behavior.

Governments might use family policy reforms for affordable credit claiming. Due to their low level of development, expansions of reconciliation policies are affordable and visible. Following the electoral cycle theory, governments introduce popular reforms close to upcoming elections. However, since policy changes are signals by incumbent parties to their electorate, party's ideology will affect the policy content.How does the electoral cycle in interaction with incumbent parties' ideology affect the timing and content of parental, maternity, and paternity leave policy reforms? The likelihood of expansions will increase with time left to the next election and pro-equality parties will strategically time defamilising reforms and traditional morality parties time familising reforms. The hypotheses are tested with a dataset of monthly policy changes of leave programmes extracted from Leave Network reports and the Social PoLicy Archive (SPLASH) for family policy reforms between 1995 and 2018 in Austria, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, and United Kingdom (1.391 cabinet-months observations). The dependent variables are a monthly dummy variable for occurrence of expansions and monthly dummy variables for familising and defamilising content. The independent variables are time remaining to the next election, and the cabinet's Pro-Equality and Traditional-Morality ideology. I use a logit regression model to estimate the probability that a cabinet introduces an expansion in given month and an interaction between time left and the ideology variables to estimate the probability that a cabinet introduces a familising / defamilising reform.

If leadership is conceptualized as the circumstance when officials take actions that are unpopular, and then public opinion comes to agree with their decision, why does this happen? Re-election minded officials put their careers in jeopardy when they lead, so why do they take this risk? I develop a series of explanations for why officials attempt to lead. These explanations focus on heterogeneous expectations among citizens, citizen trust in government and in specific officials, the role of policy realization, and other factors. I show that under a variety fo circumstances it is a better strategy for officials to adopt unpopular positions than to side with the majority of their constituents. I then present preliminary findings using data on US budgetary decisions to explore how often and under what circumstances Presidents attempt to lead public opinion.	Parties and Representation

Yet because affluence correlates with education and political information, it is hard to ascertain whether the observed differentials in political responsiveness reflect inequalities in substantive political representation or merely disparities in political information among income groups. In this paper, I provide the first estimates of differential political responsiveness, net of the effect of informational disparities. I do so by combining data on public support for social spending with data on actual social spending from 20 advanced democracies between 1985 and 2019. In line with most previous research, I find that the evolution of social spending since the 1980s better reflect the preferences of more affluent groups, but the differentials in political responsiveness are entirely explained by informational disparities: once informational disparities are accounted for, political responsiveness is strikingly equal. These results suggest that, by not accounting for differences in information among income groups, previous research exaggerate inequalities in political voice, and challenge the dominating narrative that 'rich people rule'.

In parliamentary regimes, coalitional governments collapse more often than single-party governments as coalition partners can break the coalition (Warwick 1994). In this paper, I examine the conditions under which this is true. I argue that when in a coalition government the junior coalition partner is pivotal --that is the opposition is more unified-- the coalition is more stable than when the opposition is fragmented. Moreover, I show that in this case, junior coalition partners more often leave the coalitions than senior coalition partners. I argue that this is because pivotal junior coalition partners have bigger bargaining leverages and can get more financial compensation from their senior coalition partners than non-pivotal ones. In turn, when a party has more money it can sustain its core voters even if the government loses its popularity. Thus, pivotal junior parties are less pressured by the public opinion than non-pivotal ones. I provide empirical evidence for this theory by examining the structure of the legislative party systems, government spending patterns and coalition break-downs in 17 Western European Countries from 1970-2013.

Evidence from the Spanish Law on Citizen Security	563	How do people in liberal democracies respond to the restriction of protest rights? It is a well-established view that protest rights are crucial for liberal democracies. However, governments regularly attempt to restrict these rights. In 2015, the Spanish government adopted a new law to limit protest activities due to a surge in anti-government protests following the Great Recession. To examine the impact of this law, I apply synthetic control methods to analyze protest event data from 30 European democracies. My results show that, contrary to its intended purpose, the number of protest participants skyrockets after the enactment of the Law on Citizen Security. External validity checks show that these results can also travel to other attempts to limit civil liberties.	Behaviour and Opinion

Yet, less attention has been given to explaining variation in targets of protesters’ violence, or accounted for the variation in the protest organizational dimensions. In addressing these gaps, this paper argues that such target selection depends on the organizational characteristics of protester groups, especially the degree of organization cohesion and the presence of clear decision-making authority. The preliminary results of quantitative analysis of anti-government protests events in Africa between 1991 and 2017 are consistent with these expectations. Targeting government-affiliated individuals and properties is more likely when the movement has a clear and centralised decision-making agency. Attacking on civilians and private properties is more extensively used in a civil resistance movement with the decentralised and leader-less organizations involved in.

Public diplomacy is divided into three dimensions - the structure of departments dealing with public diplomacy, the goals of public diplomacy, and its tools.

Two prominent examples include the Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera and the Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya news channels. How do Qatar and Saudi Arabia use these media outlets to advance their interests? Building on scholarship in public diplomacy and media effects, I argue that these countries have utilized the agenda-setting and framing roles of transnational media to influence Arab publics by shaping ideas and discourse in the Middle East. Qatar has used Al-Jazeera to mobilize Arab masses by focusing on topics that may anger Arabs, such as discussions of victims of foreign intervention and domestic repression. Saudi Arabia has used Al-Arabiya to pacify Arab publics by paying more attention to apolitical news. Using topic modeling and dictionary methods on hundreds of thousands of articles from Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera, I examine how the two media sources covered these different themes and how they framed three prominent episodes in the region: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the 2013 coup in Egypt, and the 2017 diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbors. This study contributes to the literature on public diplomacy. While much of the research on public diplomacy has focused on great powers or Western democracies, this paper shows that even smaller autocracies use media to influence foreign masses. Additionally, this study contributes to the international relations in the Middle East literature, as regional tensions have increased in recent years partly because of the way state-funded media cover foreign competitors.

Promotion of human rights abroad is not only costly, it also risks harm to competing foreign policy priorities such as national security. How important is human rights in mass opinion on foreign policy in democracies? In particular, how much of a priority do people in democracies put on human rights abroad relative to national security concerns? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes South Korean public opinion of North Korea. The extensively documented and publicized nature of human rights atrocities by the North Korean regime and the high level of threat posed by Pyongyang to Seoul makes the bilateral relationship a critical case for the importance of national security and human rights in mass opinion on foreign policy. Utilizing questions that make it possible to infer the relative weight of human rights and national security concerns in the responses of the South Korean public regarding North Korea over time, this paper tests key hypotheses from theories of foreign policy opinion and human rights norms.

Most scholarship on the development of an “enemy image” tends to deal with states rather than non-state actors. This research offers a study of how a non-state actor gradually shapes its “enemy image” as an integral part of a long-term conflict with a state. This question will be explored by the analysis of Hizballah's warfare against Israel in South Lebanon during the 1990s. This conflict provides an ideal case study because of its multi-dimensional nature, including ethnic, religious, national, and territorial, elements, as well as the involvement of forces that served as proxies of other power. It reveals new insights for of how an enemy image is formulated by non-state actors, as well as new historical insight into the Hizballah-Israeli conflict.This research aims to explore how Hizballah interpreted and analyzed the Israeli leadership and Israeli society’s opinions, beliefs, and resilience regarding the prolonged fighting in Lebanon in the 1990s. It will analyze how over that period, Hizballah has collected information from various sources, mostly open-source materials, dealing with both military and civilian characteristics of Israel. These include the Israeli political system and trends in Israeli society and public opinion. Hizballah observed how Israeli society’s belief in the justice of the IDF presence in southern Lebanon gradually eroded. Furthermore, it will explore how Hizballah's enemy image of the Israeli society affected its strategy, operational activity, and its psychological warfare efforts.

Promotion of human rights abroad is not only costly, it also risks harm to competing foreign policy priorities such as national security. How important is human rights in mass opinion on foreign policy in democracies? In particular, how much of a priority do people in democracies put on human rights abroad relative to national security concerns? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes South Korean public opinion of North Korea. The extensively documented and publicized nature of human rights atrocities by the North Korean regime and the high level of threat posed by Pyongyang to Seoul makes the bilateral relationship a critical case for the importance of national security and human rights in mass opinion on foreign policy.

Existing research has demonstrated that variation in rebel fragmentation can partly be explained by the violent socialisation methods the groups employ. One such method is sexual violence (Cohen 2016), which can increase unit cohesion but do so to a point that it results in rebel group fragmentation (Nagel and Doctor 2020). However, the effects of non-violent socialisation methods on rebel fragmentation are not examined in the current literature. I argue that non-violent socialisation through political education and indoctrination leads to a similarly strong bond as does violent socialisation. Moreover, I contend that the choice between violent and non-violent socialisation is determined by the social resources (ideology, religious beliefs, or ethnic affiliations) the group possesses and that education and indoctrination campaigns are likely to be funded through natural resource extraction. Both claims are tested with new and originally collected data on the socialisation efforts of rebel groups that compass a global sample at the conflict-year level. Ultimately, the theoretical model and results I present can help us forecast rebel fragmentation as well as when violence against civilians is to be expected and when not.

Even after a war has ended, however, non-state militias that fought on behalf of the victor often endure. Why do some victorious militias survive longer than others in the post-war period? I argue that incumbent victors have incentives to retain the structure of their security apparatus in order to deter the resurgence of violence, but that closed autocratic victors are especially likely to retain their militias for longer periods in order to prevent possible coup attempts and a renewed rebellion. To evaluate the argument, I use data on the post-war survival and termination of victorious militias from 1989-2014. Using a survival analysis approach, I find that victorious militias survive longer in the post-war period when an incumbent closed autocracy won the war. Conversely, I find that democratic victors terminate their links with auxiliary militias quickly after the war has ended. The results have important implications for how institutions are related to security structures and the mechanisms linking militia activity and information availability to the recurrence of civil war.

This is in opposition to extraction by the state (e.g. taxation) as part of the contract between state and polity, which is a necessary modus of state capacity development. This paper takes a formal theory approach to the question: how do elites distort state capacity to achieve state capture? It combines theories of inefficient institutions and elite capture and situates the different mechanisms of state capture within the literature on state capacity and corruption.The paper adapts the seminal Besley-Persson model of state capacity (2011) to define four different modes of state capture in the form of distinct equilibria: exploitative, clientelist, party-state extraction and predatory (Grzymala-Busse 2008). We do so by allowing for programmatic differences by party, including an economic inequality parameter, and by endogenizing governance in the model as the cost of state capture. This allows us to formulate a measure of welfare loss from state capture (akin to cost of corruption measures), which indicates a potential for structural estimation of welfare distortions.

Corporate Ownership and the Effect of Criminal Scandals	498	Multinational enterprises evade state regulations and conceal criminal financial transactions by fragmenting legal structures in foreign subsidiaries, shell companies, or conduits. Research indicates states' regulatory efforts find an unexpected helping hand from global markets themselves. News of criminal behaviors generate harsh reputational penalties for implicated companies on global financial markets. Markets would thus perform a regulatory function and behave as a kind of ""global civil society"". However, market agents differ from civil society actors because they are moved by mere profit-seeking reasons. It is not clear whether they cope with fragmentation of legal structures by penalizing a parent company for its subsidiaries' misconduct. I fill this gap and advance two opposite arguments. First, a ""conductor hypothesis"" claiming that markets recognize and penalize a parent entity for crimes involving its subsidiaries. Second, an ""insulator hypothesis"" claiming that parent companies insulate themselves from the penalties imposed by markets on their subsidiaries. I test these arguments in the case of corporate bribery scandals. I use an original dataset on unexpected scandals of corruption to estimate the effect of a subsidiary's involvement in a scandal on stock prices of the parent company. My event-study design retrieves causal estimates by imputing synthetic daily stock price counterfactuals. I illustrate my mechanism qualitatively, with a case study of two scandals involving the Italian state-owned oil company Eni SpA. I find evidence in favor of the ""insulator hypothesis"". Results indicate a failure of state regulatory action and show the limits of the regulatory function performed by financial markets.	Political Economy

The current approach aims to aggregate valid but local knowledge. ``Temporal validity"" is a form of external validity in which the target setting is in the future---which, of course, is always the case. Positivist social science has until recently been hamstrung with other, more immediate threats to validity and inference, but I argue that the cutting edge of non-parametric statistical approaches to the problem of external validity lay bare the inability of these approaches to inform human decision-making in, or make predictions about, the future. Using a large database of 32,000 RCTs conducted by a media firm between 2013 and 2015, I simulate the process of social science knowledge production and demonstrate that at the current margin, temporal validity is a first-order problem.

It is well known amongst practitioners that the substantive interpretation of induced dimensions requires care and substantive knowledge. Less well known is that the orthogonality constraints necessary to model multiple dimensions force a predictable but entirely artifactual geometrical structure into position estimates that may easily be mistaken for substantive variation. This paper characterizes the nature of this geometrical artifact, suggests when it may be expected to appear, and offers a range of statistical and substantive remedies, with particular attention to confirmatory versions of the same scaling models that ground position estimates in observed document or speaker covariates.

Our experimental manipulation will randomise information about the identity of perpetrators and victims of terror attacks (refugees and locals, in a 2x2 design). Outcome indicators consist of both attitudinal and behavioral measures. First, we are interested in how such information affects the willingness of the host population to participate in a rally in support of or against migrants; to sign a petition in support of or against migrants; to vote for political parties that are in favour of migration and against it; to donate money to NGOs that promote migrants right compared to NGOs that promote the welfare of the native population. We will also ask broader attitudinal questions about support for democracy, human rights, and compliance with international agreements related to treatment of migrants.

Policy-makers have attempted to address the negative externalities of cross-border cooperation through various policies applied to arbitrarily-defined territories. Cross-border regions thus represent an analytically advantageous setting to study how attitudes change under strong exposure to migration, and how mezzo-level economic conditions and public policies may mitigate or enhance this attitudinal change. To test hypotheses derived from the contact theory and theory of group threat, this paper employs the longitudinal and geospatial dimensions of the German Socio-Economic Panel and the Swiss Household Panel. The causal identification leverages the regression discontinuity design and examines the effect of migratory events and cross-border public policies on attitudes towards migration between 1990 and 2018. The results of this project yield important insights into the migration-attitudes nexus and have policy implications for cross-border administrations.	Behaviour and Opinion

A growing literature suggests that news media have significant effects, but we still know little about the conditions under which these occur. This study leverages the case of the Basler Zeitung, a Swiss regional daily that was suddenly and surprisingly taken over by a leading politician on the far-right in 2010, to shed light on this question. Drawing on a range of text analysis tools and panel data methods, I find that the takover led to an anti-immigrant turn in the newspaper’s political slant and a reduction in circulation rates, but there is no evidence that it systematically affected locals’ attitudes or voting. These findings highlight the existence of conditions under which media effects do not occur in high media plurality environments: when there are strong signals of the owner’s political motives.

Social Identity and the Bases of Economic Voting	900	A classic debate in the economic voting literature concerns whether voters mainly evaluate the incumbent on the basis of the national economy or their own pocketbook. In this paper, we explore a third possibility that has been largely overlooked: that they vote on the basis of the economic situation of their social group(s). In doing so, this paper makes a theoretical as well as an empirical contribution. First, it details a theoretical argument as to why we should expect voters to evaluate the economy on the basis of social groups rooted in e.g. ethnicity, class, age and locality, and how this behaviour depends on the nature of group attachments. Second, it tests the theory on two datasets. The first study uses several waves from the British Election Study Internet Panel to estimate the effects of changing economic group perceptions on incumbent approval. The second study analyses the results from a large Danish survey experiment that manipulates respondents' perceptions of the economic situations of various social in- and out-groups. We discuss the implications for our understanding of economic voting and electoral accountability, as well as potential applications to current political trends.	Behaviour and Opinion

In this paper we propose two additional ways in which partisans might arrive at biased judgements of government competence. Partisans may recall the past performance of their party more positively than they perceived it at the time, and they might extrapolate from their party's past performance to future performance more positively than they would for other parties. We use a survey experiment of over 6000 respondents to test these four possible forms of motivated reasoning, using vignettes to prime respondents about the UK government's successes and failures in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

Most research have used macro-level data to assess electoral volatility at the aggregate level, whereas micro-level research focus on respondents’ perception of the economy to assess their vote decision. Debates have oriented to the endogeneity issues of perception behind economic evaluation and to the effect of political context.While dominant research assumes the economy is a valence issue to which all citizens should react in the same manner, my argument is different. I propose that there is no single economy and there is no single economic voter. By decomposing the elements that compose the economic performance, I identify how different groups of citizens react to change and its effects over stability in support to the incumbent. The article uses survey data collected between 2008 and 2018 across eighteen democracies and aggregate indicators of economic performance at the subnational level.This presentation contributes to the literature in three aspects. Firstly, it acknowledges that there is no single type and informality, inequalities and gender are relevant drivers to the economic experience. Secondly, it disentangles how different voters perceive competing dimensions of the economic cycles. Thirdly, it considers the effect of political context on the economic experience as it compares across macro and micro-level.	Behaviour and Opinion

Cross-Border Commuters and the Economic Vote	1015	Can voters distinguish between national and international sources of economic variation, or do they arbitrarily reward (punish) governments for developments originating abroad? Extant research considers the electorate as a monolithic block. Yet, given what we know of voter sophistication, we should expect that only sophisticated and well-informed voters can correctly evaluate fluctuations in the domestic economy. In this paper I argue that cross-border commuters (CBC), by virtue of their simultaneous exposure to two national economies, present such a most likely case. I leverage the gradual increase of CBC in neighbouring Germany and France following a Swiss labour market refrom to study the effects of increasing regional economic integration on electoral support for the incumbent in all elections from 1990-2017 in France and Germany. Using a difference-in-differences approach I find that electoral support for incumbent governments, at the aggregate and individual level, increased in affected regions in France and Germany. This suggests that - contrary to my expectations - voters in these areas attributed their localised economic success to national incumbents' performance rather than the labour market reform in Switzerland. My findings hold important implications for the study of contextual economic voting and political accountability in contemporary Western democracies.	Behaviour and Opinion

This asymmetric consequence appeals to social scientists who want to understand the causes and consequences of inequality and its political implications. This research fits within this interest by focusing on the effect of a surge in housing prices on economic perceptions and political attitudes. To capture the effect of a surge in housing prices on political opinions among renters, I leverage the sharp and quick increase in housing prices in Montreal (Canada), which led most Montrealers to be poorly informed regarding the current prices. To test my hypotheses, I employ a two-arm experimental design to assess whether exposing subjects to objectives figures on housing prices in Montreal leads to a higher sense of being economically worse-off compared to their neighbors (H1), a lower sense of mobility (H2), a lower satisfaction with the economy (H3), to agree on a lower level of inequality in income (H4), to agree on an increase in social benefits to compensate income inequalities (H5) and, finally, a greater propensity to hold incumbents accountable for a surge in housing prices (H6). The results show that exposure to objective figures on housing cost triggers economic anxiety among renters while incumbents are not held accountable for their economic fragility.

We create a panel dataset of country level indicators of income inequality, trust, and polarization and run fixed effects models. In order to link this to individual behaviour, we further employ multilevel models under a range of specifications. Finally, we exploit an exogenous variation due to exposure to a Chinese import shock in order to examine if there could be a causal relationship between economic insecurity and distrust.We find that economic insecurity is associated with both growth of affective polarization and public distrust. These results hold true across alternate indicators of both economic insecurity and affective polarization. Our results support the suggestion of a relationship between trust and a perceived capacity for risk taking, and support the hypothesis that individual economic security can explain not only identity politics but also macro level political polarisation.

Implicit Attitudes Test (IAT)	121	To what extent do people identify themselves ideologically? Public opinion polls frequently measure this positioning through the recording of reflexive and rational responses. However, new research has recognized the limits of this type of measurement at the international level. Chile is an exemplary case to observe these limitations. According to the CEP public opinion survey of 2019, 72% of people declared not to identify with any sector of the ideological axis. This antecedent shows a value and ideological mismatch that needs to be observed in the country. This research is a complementary approach to measuring this phenomenon, seeking to register the implicit and latent ideological identification of people. This proposal is developed to integrate stereotypes and ideological identification using literature related to unreflective, implicit, and moral foundations behavior. In particular, it is proposed that class and gender stereotypes generate cognitive shortcuts that stimulate ideological identification. The Implicit Attitudes Test (IAT) was adapted to measure their impact in the Chilean case. The Preliminaries of the application to a pilot group are presented.	Behaviour and Opinion

Estimating the Effect of Educational Transitions on Political Values	954	A wealth of research has found that attending university will result in an individual being more economically right-wing and socially liberal (Surridge 2016), and that these differences are increasingly important for explaining vote choice (Fieldhouse et al 2020). Yet given that educational pathways are not randomly assigned, determining the causal effect of education is notoriously challenging. Previous research has suggested that where an education effect has occurred, this is attributable to peer socialisation (Mendelberg et al., 2017): but it’s not clear whether this is due to adapting views to the immediate context, or a phenomenon which holds over the longer-term. This new analysis applies the random-effects ‘within-between’ model (REWB) (Bell, Fairbrother and Jones 2019) and spline regression techniques to British Election Study Internet Panel data to estimate the change within individuals as they go through educational transitions and disentangle the contextual and socialisation effects. In this way, it provides a low-bias causal estimate on an important political question of our time.	Behaviour and Opinion

We use the UK Parliamentary Candidates Survey to generate realistic distributions of political positions and demographic attributes for Labour and Conservative candidates. We then create electoral matchups between randomly selected Conservative versus Labour candidates, with half of respondents seeing party labels in addition to candidate positions and demographics and half not seeing party labels. We analyse the relationship between respondents’ own positions and characteristics and those of candidates in the no party labels condition to understand which dimensions of candidate-respondent similarity are most highly weighted in decisions. We also compare these relationships as well as aggregate vote choice in the no party labels versus party labels conditions to understand the effect of party cues, and how they modify candidate selection in a context where candidates have realistic patterns of difference. We find evidence that party cues have much larger effects on the vote choices of past Conservative voters than on those of past Labour voters. The past Conservative voters are substantially more likely to choose the Conservative candidate in the experiment when the party label is present, whereas there is negligible effect on past Labour voters’ support for the Labour candidate in the experiment when the party label is present versus when it is not	Behaviour and Opinion

We find that political parties have ample latitude to shape citizen preferences about far-reaching international cooperation, as both in-parties and out-parties significantly affect citizen preferences about fiscal integration. This pattern is remarkably robust across countries and across citizens with different levels of ideological commitment to the EU.

Political Sophistication and Decision Difficulty as Conditions of Candidate Voting in Concurrent Elections	757	Parties' lead candidates can provide heuristic cues that serve as information shortcuts, helping voters choose. Much research on the personalisation of politics assumes that only unsophisticated voters rely on this information shortcut to reach a vote choice since sophisticated voters possess the necessary political knowledge to render such compensation strategies obsolete. However, the empirical evidence does not support this expectation. Following Lau and Redlawsk (2006), this contribution addresses how decision difficulty and political sophistication of a voter interact to condition the use of candidate heuristics in vote choices. Fazio's (1990) MODE model states that an individual must have both high motivation and the opportunity, i.e., the time and resources, to engage in an elaborate decision strategy, otherwise automatically activated attitudes (e.g., candidate evaluation) guide decision making. In 2009 in Germany, two state elections took place on the same day as the federal election. A concurrent election introduces an additional choice that should demand additional attention from voters while at the same time overwhelming them with additional information. This should make vote choice more difficult, decreasing the opportunity for elaborate processing while increasing automatic processing, i.e., using candidate heuristics. This leads to the expectation that candidate evaluations will have a greater influence on the vote choice of politically sophisticated voters facing two elections than when facing only one election. GLES Panel survey data from 2009 is used to examine the interaction effect of political sophistication, concurrent elections, and candidate evaluations on vote choice in multinomial logistic regressions.

At the same time that their audience is changing, they have to change their speeches. Also, their speeches are not only based on the traditional left-right scale position to explain every single issue. Issues like decentralization or devolution have developed the political discussion beyond that. In addition, in multilevel countries, party leaders have to deal with different territorial audiences. In an audience like parliaments, the influence of MP’s from high regional identity territories and how political leaders manage this presence are essential for their speeches. Are parliamentary speeches significantly decentralized than Party Conferences speeches with respect to speeches position over decentralization? The primary assumption is that political party leader’s change their speeches over decentralization depends on their audience. To predict party leaders’ position over decentralization, I use data from supervised speeches analysis from the United Kingdom and Spain. I analyze parliamentary investiture speeches and national party conferences speeches as different audiences. I expect that party leaders have a stronger position over decentralization when they have to take a position in front of MP’s from different regions than when they have to present intra-party speeches. These results hold relevant implications in terms of study political leaders in multilevel institutions and multilevel countries. Also, the use of quantitative text analysis method is an essential contribution to the speeches analysis field.	Parties and Representation

Yet, few existing datasets or approaches provide sufficient granular data or validation at the party or politician level across a range of topics. Furthermore, surveys come with known biases that limit the inferences that can be made for measures of preference. We propose a supervised approach based on state of the art multilingual representation learning that enables transfer of automated coding of Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) categories to new languages and domains without labelled data. This approach combines the wealth of existing hand-coded legislative data from the CAP to train a classifier to predict the content of previously unleveraged parliamentary speech. Our approach classifies parliamentary speech according to the CAP codebook. We use a massive multilingual transformer to extend content analysed data to additional languages not previously studied with this framework. This classification approach allows us to predict the issue content and supports the scaling of parliamentary speech in 7 languages in 8 countries. We compare results of this classification and scaling to existing methods (Wordfish, Wordscores, Semscale) and evaluate the effectiveness against a new set of hand coded benchmarks. Both the data and approach will be useful for predicting issue level changes in election statements, political speech, and policy changes.	Parties and Representation

We study how some incumbents, towards the end of their current term, learn that they will not get renominated by their party. How does such a negative re-election shock impact parliamentary behavior? We compare changes in the behavior of incumbents that lose fights at the nomination meeting, to change in the behavior of uncontested incumbents using a difference-in-discontinuity design. We leverage fine-grained data varying at the politician-day level to study both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of legislative behavior using votes in parliament, bill sponsorship, and legislative speech. Our results show that lame duck status have a strong negative effect on the probability of showing up in parliament to vote. We find, however, no clear evidence that lame duck status affect the extent to which legislators deviate from the party line. Our findings align well with the citizen-candidate framework, where candidates have fixed ideological positions that do not vary based on electoral incentives.	Parties and Representation

We leverage fine-grained data varying at the politician-day level to study both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of legislative behavior using votes in parliament, bill sponsorship, and legislative speech. Our results show that lame duck status have a strong negative effect on the probability of showing up in parliament to vote. We find, however, no clear evidence that lame duck status affect the extent to which legislators deviate from the party line. Our findings align well with the citizen-candidate framework, where candidates have fixed ideological positions that do not vary based on electoral incentives.	Parties and Representation

Such a crisis might lead to decreased political polarization and increased cooperation between parties (Louwerse et al. 2021). However, parties’ reactions towards COVID-19 might also be driven by their ideology, dividing parties between pro-/anti-lockdown and pro-/anti-EU solidarity and the extent to which countries are affected by the pandemic. We analyze patterns of conflict over COVID-19 policies based on a novel and comprehensive collection of roll-call votes on COVID-19 policies held in the European Parliament between March 2020 and December 2020. The EP provides a crucial case to analyze the ideological and country-specific drivers of the parliamentary responses to a worldwide crisis. Methodologically, we apply the recently developed dyadic approach to analyzing EP roll-call voting (van der Veer and Otjes 2020). Our findings provide new insights regarding the question of which factors influence political competition on COVID-19 policies.	Parties and Representation

Yet, few existing datasets or approaches provide sufficient granular data or validation at the party or politician level across a range of topics. Furthermore, surveys come with known biases that limit the inferences that can be made for measures of preference. We propose a supervised approach based on state of the art multilingual representation learning that enables transfer of automated coding of Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) categories to new languages and domains without labelled data. This approach combines the wealth of existing hand-coded legislative data from the CAP to train a classifier to predict the content of previously unleveraged parliamentary speech. Our approach classifies parliamentary speech according to the CAP codebook. We use a massive multilingual transformer to extend content analysed data to additional languages not previously studied with this framework. This classification approach allows us to predict the issue content and supports the scaling of parliamentary speech in 7 languages in 8 countries. We compare results of this classification and scaling to existing methods (Wordfish, Wordscores, Semscale) and evaluate the effectiveness against a new set of hand coded benchmarks. Both the data and approach will be useful for predicting issue level changes in election statements, political speech, and policy changes.	Parties and Representation

Our main hypothesis is that the effect of benchmarking will work more prominently when benchmarking is against an out-group community as compared to neutral communities. We test this affective territorial polarization hypothesis using a benchmarking experiment conducted in representative samples of several Spanish regions. We treat individuals in each region with information that compares negatively their economic management to: a) the national average; b) a region that generates neutral feelings to the individual respondent; and c) an out-group region for the individual respondent. We then test whether high levels of affective territorial polarization weaken the role of benchmarking upon regional accountability.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, recent research has also shown that identity-based polarization exists beyond partisan divides. Building on this insight, we develop the concept of place-based affect proposing that affective polarization across the urban-rural divide provides a powerful explanation for Europe’s electoral geography. In line with existing studies on the transformation of European politics, we focus on the cosmopolitan-nationalist cleavage. We argue that this cleavage is nurtured by distinct urban and rural identities separating cosmopolitan urbanites from a nationalist countryside, resulting in diverging voting behaviour between both geographical areas. Drawing on orignal survey data from Germany, we show that individuals from rural places, who like their own kind, but dislike city people, are more inclined to vote for nationalist parties. In contrast, the opposite is true for urban place-based affect. Urbanites, liking city people and disliking people from rural areas, tend to vote more cosmopolitan. These empirical results demonstrate that affective polarization across the urban-rural divide is pronounced and that it can serve as an important explanation of electoral geography in Europe.

Evidence from a survey experiment	880	Public opinion polls have become important and increasingly visible elements of representative democracies. Especially during election campaigns, opinion polls reflecting citizens' vote intentions attract substantial media attention. In this regard, previous research has frequently shown that polls can influence both citizens' vote intentions as well as political parties' campaign strategies.At the same time, opinion polls are fraught with great uncertainty. One way to reflect this uncertainty is to report confidence intervals. This paper investigates how citizens change their vote intention dependent on whether polling estimates are presented with or without confidence intervals. Using a vignette experiment (N=3000), we examine this question based on a real-world example in which different election polls were shown to respondents ahead of the 2021 federal election in Germany. We manipulated the display of confidence intervals and journalists' interpretation of the polls. In this way, we estimate the average causal effect of confidence intervals on citizens' vote intentions.The findings of this study are important for two main reasons. First, they will help understand the extent to which confidence intervals in media reports can help citizens make more informed (strategic) vote choices. They will thus shed light on whether depicting opinion polls’ uncertainty can affect key features of representative democracy, such as democratic accountability. Second, this paper's findings will also contribute to the broader debate on the potential benefits of confidence intervals for communicating scientific research results to the broader public.

There is a consensus among scholars that party polarization has increased in European democracies since the mid-1990s. This new and broader political offer should increase the clarity of political alternatives and the stakes of elections for voters. Nevertheless, contradictory to some implications of the spatial competition theory of voting, electoral participation has been decreasing since the end of the 1980s. This paper argues that an important feature of European multiparty systems has not been taken into account thus far when analyzing the effect of party polarization on electoral mobilization, which could explain the inconsistent findings in the literature. Namely, European multi-party systems are characterized by a bi-dimensional structure of party competition divided in economic and cultural issues where parties have not polarized equally. In addition, this paper further argues that the effect of party polarization on electoral mobilization should be conditional upon the individual salience of each these issue dimensions for citizens. Exploiting the variation of party polarization in each of these dimensions across countries between 2002 and 2018 using Chapel Hill Expert Survey and ESS data, this paper explores whether party polarization on economic or cultural issues lead to electoral mobilization.

It aims to connect two aspects in the reactionary narratives around the so-called “gender ideology”. First, drawing on Michael Freeden, it situates the discursive framing of “gender ideology” within the logic of conservative ideological grammar. Conservative thinking construes traditions from existing hierarchical orders and mirrors the conceptual apparatus of their ideological adversaries to subvert them. I will argue that the concept of “gender ideology” operates as a “combat concept” (via Koselleck) through which conservative ideologies construe an enemy for their critique of perceived social changes. This construction serves to protect the sexual and gender hierarchies deemed to be under threat by the egalitarian human rights project. Secondly, this discursive practice employs conspiracism. Here I will draw on the literature that views conspiracy theories as narrative instruments which serve the purposes of political propaganda. Conspiracy theories in this key do not always offer “theories” but aim for delegitimation and demonization of opponents with innuendo, without offering specifics (Muirhead & Rosenblum 2019). At the same time, gender ideology conspiracy theories follow a script like the one established by the far-right “cultural Marxism” conspiracy theory about the intellectual attempts to destroy Western civilization by subverting its values and taking over key institutions. I will illustrate on the case of Slovakia how deploying “gender ideology” rhetoric in political practice has exemplified conspiratorial thinking and was used to demonize political opponents and subvert political discussion.

Does experiences of sexism and gender-based violence affects women' decision to drop out of politics? And how about BME/LGBT/disabled candidates? This article answers these questions by using evidence from the Representative Audit of Britain survey of candidates standing in the 2017 and 2019 General Elections. This is an issue of upmost importance as the fear of gendered abuse and violence may constitute an additional constraining factor on the desire and ability of women to stand for office and pursue a political career.

During the last ten years, young male citizens in South Korea have increasingly engaged in anti-feminism movement and displayed political conservatism; this has been attributed to growing youth unemployment. Studies have argued that structural labor market changes--mostly induced by automation and globalization--have led to the rise of right-wing authoritarianism in advanced economies. One of the central mechanisms has been status anxiety of middle-skilled workers who are likely to be replaced by either machines or foreigners. Yet, the studies have mainly focused on Western Europe and US, and do not take into account different social contexts that give rise to moral emotions. The status anxiety argument does not help us to explain why we see younger citizens in their 20s, who have not even entered the labor market, becoming more politically conservative and less tolerant of minorities in other parts of the world; the current explanation also does not help us understand why the target of economic frustrations is women, and not foreigners, in some parts of the world. Rather than analyzing anxieties alone, the study incorporates other important moral emotions: shame, guilt, and pride. Utilizing a mixed-method approach by combining a nationally representative survey of Korean citizens with qualitative evidence from in-depth interviews, the paper argues that citizens' emotional reactions to the labor market changes are not given but influenced by how they process social cues.

While issue ownership has long been considered a stable attribute of parties, recent studies have documented the dynamic nature of individual voters’ perceptions of party issue competence and have demonstrated that voters who change their issue ownership attributions are more prone to change their party vote accordingly. Despite the electoral consequences of a voter’s changing issue ownership perceptions, little is known about the sources of such instability. So far, the emerging literature has mainly focused on the role of campaign information, but has neglected the role of individual-level factors. This paper tackles this gap and brings in the role of the accessibility of voters’ issue ownership perceptions. For voters with more accessible perceptions, it is immediately clear who the most competent party is, while voters with less accessible attitudes have to think longer before they can identify an issue-owning party. We contend that more accessible competence perceptions are more stable. Furthermore, this accessibility effect should be more pronounced for voters who do not identify with the party that they deem most competent, and for party-issue pairs that correspond to long-standing party reputations on the aggregate level (e.g. the Greens and the environment). Empirically, we measure the accessibility of voters’ issue ownership perceptions by survey response times. Our analysis of data from a multi-wave panel survey conducted in the framework of the Swiss Election Study (Selects) largely supports our expectations.	Behaviour and Opinion

In this research note, we argue that the degree to which voters’ preferences are biased by candidate gender may vary across voters and votes. We show that the increasing availability of individual-level ballot data opens up new opportunities to study the distribution of group affinity voting within electorates. Drawing on simulations and real data from Lithuanian national elections, we demonstrate that [mixed logit models/social network analysis] can be used to investigate the distribution of gender biases across and within individual voters and votes, and to assess the relative importance of gender compared to other candidate characteristics.

In this paper, I argue that a party’s party family gives valuable information to voters regarding the broader ideological goals of the party. As a result, parties that distance themselves and hold ideological positions counter to the positions of the party are more likely to lose voters and have voters misperceive their positions. Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the Comparative Manifesto Project, I find support for my expectations. As divergence between a party and the rest of its party family increases, voters are more likely to switch from that party and are more likely to misperceive that party’s true position. Importantly, this increased propensity to misperceive the parties’ positions from party family divergence increases the likelihood a voter switches. These findings have important implications for understanding voter behavior and how voters perceive parties in increasingly globalized politics.	Behaviour and Opinion

The emotions of interest are: anxiety, hope, and anger. The study’s approach is from an appraisal cognitive perspective rather than considering the valence of the emotions. According to the appraisal cognitive approach the dimensions of emotions that impact people’s judgment the most are: certainty, pleasantness, attentional activity, anticipated effort, and attribution. The main hypothesis is that emotions that combine low pleasantness, high level of certainty, and attribution (i.e. anger) would tend to motivate subjects to support populist policies. The study allows to also test whether people seek more information and spend more or less time thinking about it before expressing a judgment. Participants took part in an online experiment to trigger people’s emotions and ask them to evaluate two policy positions on economic development in Hungary. The results show that it is the people in the anxiety condition who support more the populist frame, while only people in the hope condition seek more information. These results shade light to the role of context in the study of emotions, cognition, and political judgment.	Behaviour and Opinion

In this article, we extend the idea of partisan bias to any kind of (single-tier) electoral system.

One key consequence of the pandemic is that many countries have seen an increase in the salience of competent governance. To explore the impact of COVID-19 on electoral politics, we present a theoretical framework where politicians compete over ideological platforms but can be distinguished by their competence. Our model features both uncertainty about the location of the representative voter and valence uncertainty. We first show that absent direct concerns about competence, political polarization is positively related to ideological uncertainty. An increased salience of competence for voters (brought on by a social crisis like COVID-19) leads to greater ideological polarization among politicians, and this increase is concentrated in districts with low ideological uncertainty. We examine the implications of our theory using data from Brazilian municipality elections. Using a difference-in-differences methodology we find that COVID-19 leads to increased political polarization in Brazil, but that this increase is concentrated in areas where the partisan leaning of voters is relatively certain.

Finally, we analyze the relationship between women's political representation and gendered trade protectionism and find that gendered protectionism inequalities are decreasing with women's share of legislative seats.

Finally, we analyze the relationship between women's political representation and gendered trade protectionism and find that gendered protectionism inequalities are decreasing with women's share of legislative seats. Our analyses contribute to mounting evidence of the importance of descriptive representation for substantive outcomes while simultaneously improving our understanding of the global gender wage gap and the differential effects that trade liberalization can have across groups, particularly those underrepresented in government.

Evidence from the Euro Area	335	Central bankers are expected to communicate facts about the economy and shape individuals’ expectations about the economic future. However, credibility in economic affairs is often male-coded, particularly around the anti-inflationary commitments that central banks often need to project. Does gender shape central bankers’ effectiveness as communicators? We approach our research question with an experimental design in which survey takers are given an informational vignette that is variously attributed to male and female ECB Executive Board members, who are in turn introduced with or without their full credentials. We use this data to examine whether female central bankers are differently able to shape individuals’ economic beliefs and expectations, and trust in the ECB. We surveyed nationally representative samples from five euro-area countries. Our results show that female central bankers capable of generating optimism about the economy and trust in the ECB, but only when they are introduced with their credentials. We also found evidence of a backlash against credentialed men, particularly among male survey takers. The findings have, in our view, mixed normative and practical implications about gender representation in central banking. Female central bankers were both discriminated against - women need to be introduced with their credentials to be taken as seriously as uncredentialed male central bankers - but also the optimal vessel for information, because credentialed men are so greatly disliked.

We argue that a positive shock to wealth can incentivize win- ners to protect their new assets using democratic channels, and provide them a change in social status that increases civic participation via petitioning. Importantly, we also focus on a never before studied population – that of female land lottery applicants and winners, who were widows allowed to enter Georgia’s first land lottery. Widows were particularly positioned to benefit from such a windfall, due to inheritance laws and dower rights in Georgia that allowed women to retain property via trust. Using micro-level data on land lottery winners and losers, land plots, and petition outcomes from 1805-1820, we estimate the causal effect of wealth windfalls on democratic par- ticipation.

Common examples include strategic, instrumental variable, and selection probits. Despite an abundance of binary time-series-cross-sectional data in political science, few applications with multiple equations account for unit-specific unobserved heterogeneity. One likely reason for this omission is that many of these models are numerically fickle and including large numbers of unit dummies can induce severe numerical instability. Indeed, multiple equation models compound standard incidental parameter problems, because each new equation comes with a full set of unit dummies. To overcome this problem, I propose a Mundlak specification to model unobserved heterogeneity in three advanced, but commonly used, models that are all based on systems of two binary equations. In all cases, the Mundlak specification outperforms dummy variable approaches even when the number of within-unit observations is quite large. The Mundlak approaches provide a simple and general solution for researchers to accommodate unit-specific heterogeneity without introducing increased numeric instability or excessive numbers of parameters, and they can be implemented using existing, commonly used software.

Previous applications of point process methods to political violence data have mainly utilized temporal Hawkes process models, neglecting spatial variation in these attack patterns. This limits what can be learned from these models, as any effective counter-terrorism strategy requires knowledge on both when and where attacks are likely to occur. Even the existing work that does exist on spatio-temporal Hawkes processes impose restrictions on the triggering function that are not well-suited for terrorism data. Therefore, we generalize the structure of the spatio-temporal triggering function considerably, allowing for nonseprability, nonstatitionarity, and cross-triggering (i.e., across the groups). To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze two samples of real-world terrorism data: Afghanistan (2002-2013) and Nigeria (2010-2017). Jointly, these two studies demonstrate that our model dramatically outperforms standard Hawkes process models, besting widely-used alternatives in overall model fit and revealing spatio-temporal patterns that are, by construction, masked in these models (e.g., increasing dispersion in cross-triggering over time).

Similarly, following transition from authoritarian rule, new democracies have to reckon with members of their repressive and enforcement apparatus. One solution is to just disband enforcement agencies in their entirety and build new ones, along with institutions of the new democratic state. Another, competing approach, is to select the “bad apples” and fire them. The latter approach is one a new democracy may want to take when it is strapped for competent enforcement agents and when competent as opposed to predominantly loyal agents were indeed employed by the preceding autocratic regime. This paper analyzes the costs and benefits of conducting what we call a thorough purge—understood as dismissing everyone up to a certain point in the law enforcement hierarchy—and a selective purge, where the competence and loyalty of agents is evaluated on a case by case basis. We propose a theory that builds on the loyalty-competency trade-off facing new democracies deliberating how to reform their security apparatus. Our model allows to make predictions about the causes as well as consequences of thorough as opposed to selective purges.

This paper explores the determinants of the legalisation of recreational marijuana in the USA. We test three hypotheses usually advanced by the literature to explain patterns of cannabis legalization: 1) state budget 2) repression 3) felony laws. Using a panel data model with state specific trends, we find that state deficit is consistently associated with a higher probability of legalisation. The percentage of people arrested for drug crimes and marijuana consumption correlates with a lower probability of legalising recreational marijuana. Finally, re-enfranchisement laws are associated with an increase in the likelihood of cannabis legalisation except in places with a high percentage of black people. Our results are broadly supported by a survival analysis and the use of a fine grained measure of marijuana laws. We provide a number of theoretical explanations for our findings.	Political Economy

Political-culture research has long considered citizen support of paramount importance for political regimes to thrive and survive.

Our contribution aims to close this gap in the literature by investigating how incidents of repression influence citizen attitudes towards the political system. We suggest repression to affect citizens’ trust in the government both directly and indirectly through the stifling of pro-democracy protests and critical media coverage. Combining survey data on political attitudes from the World Values Survey withcountry-level data on repression and pro-democracy protests from the Varieties-of-Democracy project (V-Dem) for 48 autocracies worldwide, we use multi-level models to examine the complex relationship between repression, protest, media coverage, and political support.

To overcome this literature gap, I collected novel data between 2019 and 2021 featuring 65 in-depth interviews with young Chinese professionals working in four Chinese megacities. I find that their levels of engagement are lower than expected and, more interestingly, that their attitude towards the ruling party is silently hostile. Young professionals face a trade-off: a stable job in the public sector with party membership or a career in the private sector without party affiliation and risking the so-called “996 working culture.” I argue that their personal decision pivots around their political attitudes. I find that a more robust political behavior drives those choosing the second path to actively avoid engaging with the ruling party. I define this political attitude as “semi-contentious,” where the lack of an open conflict with the regime is complemented by personal refusal of political institutions.	Behaviour and Opinion

The literature on public diplomacy has largely focused on the content and strategies of messaging rather than its actual effects, particularly with regards to messages targeting authoritarian countries. I conducted two online survey experiments, respectively in late 2018 and early 2021, to investigate the effects of the US Embassy in China’s public diplomacy efforts on Chinese social media promoting American democracy. The 2018 experiment was conducted when Sino-US relationship was relatively normal, while the 2021 experiment was conducted when the bilateral relationship has become tense and when the international image of the US has worsened due to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the January 6 insurrection in Washington DC. In both experiments, I find the US Embassy’s social media articles largely had no effects on the respondents’ views on the US, democracy, or China. Whether the articles were attributed to the US Embassy or not generally did not make a difference either. These results suggest the most powerful democracy’s efforts to promote liberty and democratic governance through social media engagement is not effective in China even when the international environment for public diplomacy is relatively benign, but it does not backfire either, as some have suspected, even when the international environment is not conducive to public diplomacy. Further, the brand name of the US embassy neither helps nor harms the messaging. The US Embassy’s diplomatic messaging in the world’s largest authoritarian society simply has null effects.

First, we re-examine the results from previous, influential studies on the mass politics of austerity using surveys in three European countries.

In the second part, we study how respondents react when they are informed about the most likely consequences of additional public debt. We expect that they support austerity in times of crisis when a failure to reduce the deficit may result in severe outcomes, such as government default or high inflation, but not in normal times.

Our analysis uses an experimental approach to assess how voters evaluate the costs and benefits of such external interventions. The results from Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain show that – with the exception of Greece – approval of fiscal adjustment is higher with than without an IMF intervention. According to a causal mediation analysis, this is the case because voters expect that the crisis is more likely to be solved when the IMF intervenes. At the same time, voters are critical of the loss of democratic control if the IMF intervenes.

The success of new measures that policymakers and health officials have introduced to combat the pandemic often relies on voluntary compliance by citizens. While the pandemic has brought increased relevance to altruistic and prosocial behavior, it is unclear if the pandemic coincides with changes in self-reported dispositional empathy, and to what extent dispositional empathy affects support for governmental measures. I use a large two-wave panel survey of UK citizens (N=7480) to analyze (1) if the Coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in affective and cognitive empathy from pre- to mid-pandemic, and (2) in what way affective and cognitive empathy drive support for ten governmental measures to combat the pandemic, such as hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing and fining rule-breakers, conditional on perceived threat to health and the economy. I find that affective and cognitive empathy remained stable from pre- to mid-pandemic on average, but that there are significant differences between demographic groups. Dispositional empathy generally predicts stronger support for measures to combat the pandemic, but there are significant differences between different types of measures, and support is highly conditional on perceived health and economic threat.

However, what ‘climate change public opinion’ is tends to be vaguely defined. Current understandings cover a variety of facets that are not always complementary, and can signal apparently contradictory patterns if used interchangeably. A cohesive, up-to-date framework for how these fit together and the measurement choices that face researchers is however absent. This is problematic as it can result in conceptual stretching whereby, in the words of Sartori, ‘we are left to swim in a sea of empirical and theoretical messiness’. Substantively, it also means that political actors of different views can cherry-pick particular surveys to back claims that publics demand action or are not ready for it.This paper thus reviews climate change questions fielded in public opinion surveys, classifies them into meaningful categories, and - drawing from the existing literature - discusses the different elements they evoke and their implications for both research and policy. Analytically, it examines trends in the popularity of climate questions capturing different underlying dimensions, highlights where particular types of climate questions have been under-fielded, and points to research gaps where the intersections between different elements should be focused on over the coming years.

Stability of meritocratic beliefs and desire for redistribution	1143	This paper considers whether globalisation shocks affect perceptions of fairness of the economy and in turn redistributive attitudes. The Meltzer-Richard puzzle in political economy is often explained by accounts of tolerance of inequality insofar as it is seen as fair (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005; Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005). Hence, the expectation is that workers more exposed to economic shocks from globalisation will lower their tolerance of inequality, as they should be learning structural factors play a role in one’s income in so far as their job becomes more at risk. On the other hand, ignorance in terms of the actual levels of inequality (Cruz, 2013) and system justification motivation (Trump, 2017) would explain the absence of an effect. Do globalisation shocks change the weights exposed workers assign to structural as opposed to individual factors?To test the question of whether workers in areas more affected by globalisation shocks are less likely to believe in meritocracy and more likely to support redistribution, the British Election Study (BES) will be used with data on sub-regional level (NUTS 3) China trade shock and other local measures of changes in economic performance. The theoretical foundations of the argument are then tested through an experimental design. Implications speak to the literature on the rise of the far right, which often mentions low social status or a feeling of resentment for not getting what one deserves as a provoking factor—without however showing the evidence in so far as it relates to compensation.

Economists typically assume that open markets will better the livelihood of the poor, but surprisingly little rigorous research exists on if and how workers in developing countries actually view globalization. To answer this question, we focus on the largest labor market cleavage in developing countries -- between formal and informal workers -- and develop competing hypotheses about their household's support for foreign direct investment (FDI)- as a proxy for globalization. Using a unique survey, we find that formal workers in India support foreign investment far more than their informal counterparts, particularly when it involves an American firm. They do so primarily because (1) formal workers are part of a wider social network that gives them privileged access to information and coveted jobs among foreign firms; and (2) as more productive workers, they are more likely to be hired by foreign firms. Informal workers, on the other hand, have access to neither. Our results are robust to several alternative explanations including skill, caste and nativist preferences.

I argue that winners and losers of globalization use a set of salient group identifiers that consists of political attitudes, lifestyle practices, and socio-demographic characteristics to distinguish themselves from each other. Specifically, these identifiers are used to categorize others as belonging to the in-group or out-group. In turn, these categorizations affect evaluations of others as being trustworthy or sharing similar values. I use data from a pre-registered conjoint experiment with a representative online sample of the German population (n=5000). Respondents are presented with evaluative choices between two persons that are described by the group identifiers. I expect heterogenous treatment effects, whereby respondents’ own group affiliations determine their preferences. Respondents’ group affiliations are measured by their proximity to the group identifiers and by their self-identification with either group. The study will investigate, (1) what the most important group identifiers of the divide are; (2) whether both groups have higher trust in and assume common values more strongly with persons from the in- than the out-group; (3) whether out-group prejudices are symmetrical between both groups. The study has important implications for understanding the distinction practices of winners and losers of globalization and, consequently, for identifying the effect of the globalization divide on social polarization.

We address both questions by studying the effect of distinct cultural heritages created by two prototypical historical family types--nuclear and stem--on women’s representation in local councils in Spain from 1979 to 2015. Although prototypical family types disappeared in the mid-twentieth century, the political representation of women after democratization was significantly lower in nuclear than in stem family regions, reflecting centuries of socialization in conservative gender norms. Differences in women political representation between regions mostly disappeared after 1990s. We examine three possible explanations: changes in labor market outcomes, changes in societal gender attitudes, and adoption of voluntary gender quotas. Our data are consistent with the latter mechanism: The top-down introduction of voluntary quotas in the late 1980s balanced-off the negative cultural legacy in nuclear region municipalities. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of cultural persistence and speculate about the role of feminist groups as ""cultural entrepreneurs"" responsible for the rapid diffusion of gender parity norms and institutional change.

Mapping Changes In The Equality Concepts Of Parties In OCED Countries Since 1970	510	There is a persistent gulf in scientific knowledge about (in)equality preferences. While voter preferences have been widely researched, parties’ conceptions of (in)equality have remained uncharted territory. Hence, if and how parties’ positions respond to voter preferences, drive policy outputs, and eventually lead to inequality outcomes could not be addressed. Taking Sen’s “Equality of What?” question as its point of departure, the paper addresses this lack of data and research on parties’ equality preferences. Equality is not something of which parties want more or less, that they favor or oppose. Rather, there are different concepts of equality whose combinations define different Varieties of Egalitarianism within and between countries. Based on a combination of one million crowd-coded decisions and expert judgments, we have compiled a data set that allows us to map how parties in 12 OECD countries conceive of equality and how their conceptions have changed since 1970. Conceptually, we distinguish between emphasis on economic equality, equal chances/mobility, equal rights and antidiscrimination, idiosyncratic conceptions of equality, and mere lip-service (“We are the party of equality”). Our findings speak directly to heated debates about if and how left parties changed their views and have traded off material equality, equal chances and equal rights: in some countries the Left has indeed de-emphasized material equality and become “woke”. Our new data allows us to map these changes. On this basis, we argue that three distinct Varieties of Egalitarianism prevail over concept-convergence across countries and party families.

Gender-specific polling stations are common in an increasing number of developing countries. Common arguments in favor of gender-segregated polling stations assert that they facilitate female electoral participation, but no empirical evidence supports this assertion. However, quantifying the effect of administrative decisions like gender-segregation is empirically challenging since most countries have either gender-segregated or mixed stations, but rarely both. We examine this question in Pakistan using observational and experimental data. First, we use data from the 2018 Pakistani General Election, which featured female-only, male-only, and combined polling stations across the country to demonstrate how gender segregation shapes turnout by gender. Second, we use a conjoint experiment with 2500 Pakistani households to assess how polling station characteristics -- like gender segregation and ease-of-accessibility -- affect citizens' propensity to vote. Focus group discussions, along with interviews with election administrators and women's rights activists, aid in dissecting the possible mechanisms generating gender gaps in political participation in Pakistan.

Although most studies argue that the gender gap closes, it has been impervious to explanation. This study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the gender gap across time. Drawing on vast empirical evidence, it argues that differences in political participation between men and women diminish with increasing female political empowerment, conceptualized as a process of increasing equality in human rights (freedom of choice), female participation in civil society (agency), as well as representation. Moreover, it contends that female political empowerment is especially important in young women’s political socialization.To investigate the extent to which female political empowerment mitigates the gender gap in political participation, this study uses an innovative methodological approach. The combined World Value Survey and European Values Study data merged with data on female political empowerment from Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) allows for the analysis of a period of nearly forty years across about 100 countries. By applying multilevel modelling, results show that female empowerment moderates inequalities in political participation. However, comparing the impact of the level of empowerment at the time of the survey and when respondents were aged 18, this paper shows that political empowerment in women’s early political socialization is much more important.Overall, the study contributes to research on the gender gap of political participation by highlighting the importance of female political empowerment and political socialization, which posits that the impact of political context is greatest during the formative years in early adulthood.

Not only on the occasion of the international women’s day protesters worldwide draw attention to sexual abuse or inequity in rights and work payment for women. Grievance theory contends that inequality triggers protest among those who are most disadvantaged. In line with this theory, protests against gender inequality should be more likely to be organized when women face higher discrimination. Despite cross-country studies on contentious politics, research on mass mobilization in favour of gender equality is comparatively scarce. This article examines whether countries with higher gender inequality see more protests calling for gender equality. To test this theoretical expectation, country-level data on indicators of gender inequality such as gender pay gap are combined with event data of protests against gender discrimination. In addition, the analysis disaggregates women’s protests into different types of such as protests prompted by gendered socioeconomic discrimination, abortion policies, and violence against women. Empirical findings thus provide more refined insights on the determinants of women’s protests.	Comparative Politics

The UK’s leaving of the EU has laid bare the lack of a future plan for Europe and will especially bring the EU—non-EU relations to the foreground in the near future (see also the failed negotiations of the EU-Swiss Institutional Framework Agreement). In the context of little research looking into Europe’s future, the few extant studies focus on the future of the European Union internally or on its relations to specific other countries. Especially theoretical advancements regarding the concepts of “differentiated (dis)integration” or “EU external governance” – and related studies’ legal, institutional focus – should be complemented with public opinion research, that is, how people perceive that (future) EU—non-EU relations should look like. The latter gained in relevance due to an increased politicization of European integration and a related “constraining dissensus” about it. This study presents comparative evidence on peoples’ preferences across eight European countries from within and outside the EU (5 EU and 3 non-EU countries). We collected original survey data in which we asked respondents (N=4549) in an open-ended question format to describe their preferences about the future relations between the EU and non-EU countries such as the UK, Switzerland, or Norway. After manually recoding and classifying these answers, we provide insights about (different) preference patterns from a within and outside EU perspective. We further link individual preferences to attitudes regarding the economy, immigration, risk-taking or multilateral cooperation and sociodemographics including left-right ideology.	European Politics

More specifically, we prime perceptions of external threat based on the coastline flooding projections for major cities.

While scholars have analyzed the consequences of public contestation on cooperation among member states, less attention has been paid to its effects on cooperation with non-EU members. Yet, after the UK’s withdrawal, the risk of encouraging further exits has reduced the scope of differentiated integration for countries outside the EU. How do these changes in the bargaining space affect public support for international cooperation in non-EU countries? To answer this question, we exploit that voters in Switzerland have been faced with two EU-related policy proposals, one of which would considerably deepen relations with the EU, whereas the other would significantly lower levels of Swiss-EU cooperation. Drawing on a panel survey fielded between November 2019 and February 2021 and an embedded survey experiment, this paper shows how the ups and downs of the Brexit process altered the expected consequences of non-cooperative referendum outcomes, and in turn Swiss vote intentions in EU referendums. Our findings show how the withdrawal of individual countries from international organizations change public expectations about the costs of non-cooperation, and highlight the influence of the geopolitical context on support for international cooperation.

Past research explains this puzzle by the growing salience of competing issues and by shifting redistributive priorities among many voters. These explanations, however, assume coherent redistributive preferences. In this paper, I argue that part of this gap can also be linked to attitudinal ambivalence—simultaneous negative and positive evaluations of an issue—toward redistributive policy. Using European Social Survey data from 2016, I find that ambivalence toward redistribution increases with lower education, geographic peripherality, political disengagement, and sociocultural conservatism. This ambivalence contributes to a greater detachment between support for redistribution and left-wing self-identification and to a greater likelihood of voting for more economically and culturally right-wing parties. These patterns hold independently of second-dimension attitudes and new class divisions and replicate in earlier data from 2008, implying a distinct, long-standing influence on voters. These findings contribute to ongoing debates on the links and disconnects between voter preferences and left-right voting and on the challenges faced by economically progressive parties across Europe.

Focusing on different contexts, using different data, and drawing on different methods, existing scholarship has identified a number of factors that meaningfully predict welfare state attitudes. While these studies undoubtedly deepen our understanding of the considerations driving support for the welfare state, they generally depart from the assumption that citizens believe that the actions that governments take will actually result in redistribution. Nevertheless, existing work has shown that the existence of a redistributive framework does not always guarantee that resources will go toward social programs. What happens when citizens are aware of this problem? Do they change their attitudes toward the welfare state when exposed to information about government ineffectiveness? This project examines the impact of perceptions about the quality of government on attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. In particular, it sets out to uncover how exposure to information about government inefficiency affects general support for state-sponsored redistribution; whether this information leads individuals to embrace specific policy designs; and if this information induces respondents to embrace alternative forms of inequality reduction that occur in the labor market. To do so, I run original survey experiments in Bulgaria, Spain, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. My results shed light on the conditions under which citizens withdraw support for state-sponsored redistribution and turn to other policies that alleviate income differentials.	Behaviour and Opinion

The extant literature provides mixed evidence on the relationship between local inequality—specifically exposure to poorer individuals among the well-off—and support for redistribution with most studies answering this question in the affirmative, while a single, but prominent study find that the wealthy become less supportive of redistribution when exposed to poorer people. This paper sets out to resolve the divergent findings in the literature by analyzing the relationship between exposure to poor individuals and support for redistribution. We do this by employing a design closer to the studies that have found a positive relationship, but with more causal leverage than these (a three-wave panel design linked to fine-grained registry data on local income composition from Denmark), to study the consequences of exposure to poor among the better-off over longer periods of time. In within-individual models analyzed by means of two-way fixed effects, we find that exposure to poor individuals is associated with lower support for redistribution among wealthier individuals. Further, when analyzed cross-sectionally (in between-individual models), we find a positive relationship between exposure to poor individuals and support for redistribution among the better-off, thus indicating that self-selection based on stable characteristics (which are held constant in the within-individual models) is a likely explanation for previous findings of a positive relationship between rich people’s exposure to poor neighbors and their support for redistribution.

It argues that individuals’ attitudes regarding fairness shape their views about paying taxes and their ethical stances regarding tax evasion. Using survey data for 18 major cities in Latin America, we find that individuals who are highly sensitive to fairness are less likely to consider paying taxes as a civic duty and more likely to justify tax evasion. These attitudes towards tax compliance are not inelastic. We also find evidence that individuals’ beliefs about reciprocity and merit mediate the effect of fairness on personal views about tax compliance. Finally, this paper shows that the heuristics people use to explain their position in the income distribution make them more or less sensitive to inequality, and it affects their tax morale. These findings help us better understand the concept of reciprocity and provide valuable lessons on the urgent task of expanding fiscal capacity to promote economic growth and inequality in developing countries.

Looking at how the economic crisis impacted Europe in the late 2000’s and early 2010’s, I aim at understanding how this external shock affected voter’s perceptions and ultimately voters' behavior. For a better understanding of this impact at this level, I use a survey experiment. More specifically I ask: how do external shocks frame political preferences on income inequalities? I analyse how the exposure to an economic shock may have affected attitudes on income distribution. I expect that a negative impact of the shock will boost support of income inequality issues along time. Nevertheless, there is a strong partisanship effect in what regards the defense of income inequality. As individuals are more likely to align around their ideological preferences, citizens with more left party alignments will more likely defend the reduction of income inequality, and right wing aligned the less. The economic shock should contribute to reinforce already existing preferences.	Behaviour and Opinion

Yet men and women are constrained by gender role expectations, which limit the range and type of acceptable emotions that a leader can express. In this paper, we examine how gender shapes the behavior of political leaders through a new venue: emotional expression in images posted by leaders on social media. We use more than a million posted images from all U.S. Congressional social media accounts (including Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook). For all images posted, we use supervised machine learning methods to identify anger, sadness, and happiness in the faces in images posted by Members of Congress (MOCs). Specifically, we 1) develop a custom facial recognition model to identify MOCs in social media imagery and 2) train and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect emotional displays. Drawing on research on role congruity, we argue that women MOCs will post images with a broader range and higher level of emotions, but will be less likely than men MOCs to post images of themselves expressing emotion. The project offers an opportunity to understand how political leaders use emotions and images to communicate to constituents and gender shapes these strategic actions.	Political Communication

Gender Bias in Voters' Perceptions of Political Arguments	59	That 'nasty', 'vicious', and 'unfeminine' are recent descriptions of prominent women politicians showcases the persistence of sexism in politics. However, causally identifying the presence of gender bias in the judgement of women's behaviour is challenging. In this research, I assess whether voters are biased in how they perceive and evaluate the ways in which politicians communicate. To address this, I design a survey experiment where UK voters are presented with arguments representative of a range of styles congruent with gender stereotypes. The MP gender, argument style, and policy area are manipulated to assess, first, whether there is a backlash effect when politicians violate gender-based stereotypes, and second, whether voters' differential perception of the styles themselves might explain this backlash. While I find that style usage has important consequences for voters' evaluations of the likeability and competence of MPs, this does not vary by MP gender. The results suggest that, at least in the UK, women politicians do not need to conform to stereotypical expectations to be positively evaluated by voters.	Political Communication

A Demographic Analysis of Influential Commentators on Twitter	767	When political issues are debated in the public sphere, whose opinions do we hear? In broadcast media, political commentary is dominated by politicians, journalists, and political pundits (Page, 1996; Bennett, 1990). In the UK, as in many Western democracies, these actors tend be older, white upper-class men (Duff, 2008). Consequently, the voices of women, ethnic minorities, young people, and everyday citizens are marginalised (Wayne, 2010; Kassova, 2020). Social media allows these marginalised actors to bypass institutional gatekeepers. However, we do not know whether online political commentary is more demographically diverse. This paper addresses this question by examining the most-retweeted actors on Brexit: an issue which has mobilised a vast swathe of the British public. By analysing the top 105 commentators across 10 salient Brexit discussions, it shows that citizen opinion leaders make up a significant minority of the top retweeted accounts. However, stark gender, ethnic and age disparities remain. These results raise significant doubts over social media’s potential to pluralise political debate. Greater attention should be paid to factors that exclude certain demographic groups from the online public sphere.	Political Communication

Drawing on comprehensive survey data from 14 established democracies in Western Europe, we find clear evidence that women are generally more “progressive” than men are. More specifically, we document that women have more progressive attitudes than men do on all the five attitudinal dimensions that we consider, and these patterns are remarkably similar across West European countries, despite the cross-country differences in political cultures and systems. As anticipated by previous arguments, we find that gender gaps are often larger among young citizens than older ones. We also elaborate on potential implications of our findings for other political outcomes of interest, including voting behavior and the functioning of representative democracy, and point to avenues for future research in detailing the mechanisms that contribute to the observed gender gaps.

Socio-Structural Determinants of Attitudes Towards Gender Equality and its Relevance for Electoral Behaviour.	526	In recent years, new tensions have flared up regarding the demand for gender equality policies for women. In this context, it is mainly right-wing populist and far-right parties that fuel the debate by positioning themselves against women's and reproductive rights and in doing so, collide with egalitarian positions of left-wing parties. These opposing attitudes generate different demands regarding welfare state policies and simultaneously have a divisive effect on social cohesion. Nevertheless, gender-related issues remain fairly neglected in research on electoral behaviour. This is even more surprising as studies continually find that voting behaviour remains gendered, with women tending to vote more often for left-wing parties and men for right-wing parties. Against the background of a renewed politicisation of gender-related issues, the paper explores the influence of attitudes towards gender equality on voting behaviour. We ask, who supports or opposes demands for more equal rights measures for women? Moreover, do attitudes towards gender equality influence voting behaviour?To empirically address these questions, we rely on a newly surveyed gender equality item from a quota based online survey of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) conducted in September 2021. The analysis proceeds in three steps: First, we look at how voters are distributed along the question of whether state equality measures for women still don’t go far enough or already go too far. Second, we identify socio-structural determinants of attitudes towards gender equality and the influence of gender attitudes. Third, we assess the impact of attitudes towards gender equality on vote choice.	Behaviour and Opinion

Drawing on comprehensive survey data from 14 established democracies in Western Europe, we find clear evidence that women are generally more “progressive” than men are. More specifically, we document that women have more progressive attitudes than men do on all the five attitudinal dimensions that we consider, and these patterns are remarkably similar across West European countries, despite the cross-country differences in political cultures and systems. As anticipated by previous arguments, we find that gender gaps are often larger among young citizens than older ones. We also elaborate on potential implications of our findings for other political outcomes of interest, including voting behavior and the functioning of representative democracy, and point to avenues for future research in detailing the mechanisms that contribute to the observed gender gaps.

Socio-Structural Determinants of Attitudes Towards Gender Equality and its Relevance for Electoral Behaviour.	526	In recent years, new tensions have flared up regarding the demand for gender equality policies for women. In this context, it is mainly right-wing populist and far-right parties that fuel the debate by positioning themselves against women's and reproductive rights and in doing so, collide with egalitarian positions of left-wing parties. These opposing attitudes generate different demands regarding welfare state policies and simultaneously have a divisive effect on social cohesion.

Millions of men have been drafted into compulsory military services in Western democracies. Yet while a rich body of research investigates the effects of combat participation on soldiers' attitudes, we know little about the effects of military service in the absence of combat. However, a widely shared concern is that the military socializes its draftees into authoritarian values running orthogonal to the values of civilians' lives in democracies. I identify the causal effect of compulsory military service on recruits' political attitudes by leveraging the quasi-random assignment of the re-introduced draft in Germany in 1956. Using several data sources and a fuzzy regression design I find that if anything military service makes draftees more interested in politics and democratic participation. These findings have huge implications for an ongoing debate about the military and the political radicalization of draftees.	Behaviour and Opinion

Despite the fact that globalization has made societies increasingly interconnected and interdependent, with an ever-increasing mixture of cultures within the same contextual conditions, the global village has yet to yield homogeneity: societies differ and differences are transmitted across generation, regardless of the homogenizing power of hegemonic cultures. Why do we not all melt into the pot? Focusing on a case study on Italy’s memory of the authoritarian past, I argue that local cultural transmission, driven by families and local communities jointly, is crucial in the transmission of minoritarian memories. I show that by providing evidence that local and family-level characteristics are important for the transmission of views that are minoritarian in the larger national society, and irrelevant for the transmission of majoritarian traits. I employ original survey data to measure individual remembrance on the authoritarian experience. Then, I combine municipality-level information and archival data with respondents' family history during the regime to provide empirical support to my theoretical argument. I show that family history, family socialization efforts, local history, local memory entrepreneurs and the availability of local networks of civic engagement are crucial for the successful transmission of minoritarian memories, and are not relevant for the transmission of majoritarian ones.

The African Union along with various regional organizations have included in their treaties clauses calling for their member-states to adhere to democratic governance. Moreover, organizations including the AU and the Economic Community of West African States have used punishments such as membership suspension, sanctions, and military force to motivate states experiencing democratic reversals to change course. Yet, despite these trends, there has been no investigation on how Africans perceive external involvement in fostering democratic rule. This study remedies this gap in existing research by evaluating public attitudes towards such external pressure from the sixth round of the Afrobarometer survey. Specifically, the study explores how individual assessment of electoral practice are and a country’s history of unconstitutional changes of government influence public preference for external involvement in fostering democracy. This study’s findings demonstrate how a country’s political history can in turn affect its citizens preferences for external democracy promotion.	Behaviour and Opinion

This paper utilizes the largest dataset on public opinion ever assembled in Russia--containing over 1.4 million polling responses drawn from two decades of polling by Russia's top polling agencies--to analyze how the cancellation of elections in Russia's large cities has affected public attitudes toward the authorities. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that election cancellation reduces support for President Vladimir Putin. The effect is stronger among the young, who are presumably more likely to value elections. We also find that the effect is stronger in more democratic regions and in cities where mayoral elections were competitive. This suggests that the public is more likely to punish incumbents for canceling elections when those elections are perceived as meaningful.	Behaviour and Opinion

Yet, I argue that outside of the context of liberal democracies this operationalization of state legitimacy suffers from a serious lack of measurement validity because 1) people often conflate their support for institutions with support for current actors in office and 2) more often than previously assumed regard other, non-democracy principles as regime principles. As electoral autocracies are now the most common regime type in the world and together with closed autocracies are a home to 68% of the world population (Luhrman et al., 2018, Alizada, 2021), creating a valid measurement of state legitimacy in electoral autocracies seems to be a valuable task. I provide evidence for the first and second claim through the analysis of in-depth interviews on a sample of citizens from Serbia, a typical electoral autocracy. In addition, I show support for the second claim by running a confirmatory factor analysis using the Latin Barometer survey data. Based on the results I offer some suggestions for an improved measurement strategy of state legitimacy in the context of electoral autocracies.	Behaviour and Opinion

In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, they for instance had to predict the likeliness that a vaccine would be available soon. Research shows that people in general are poor at making predictions and suggests that political elites may even be worse. Yet, we lack systematic knowledge of how political elites make predictions in real-world situations, and which factors influence this. Overconfidence, which occurs when someone’s subjective confidence in the own judgment is substantially greater than the judgment’s objective accuracy, may be important but this factor to date is rarely examined in this context.This paper explores how political elites make predictions about the future, paying specific attention to the role of overconfidence, through an explorative case study of the judgment and decision making by Dutch political elites during the Covid-19 pandemic between January 2020 and December 2021. Methodologically, I will use both dictionary-based and qualitative text analysis approaches to analyze press conferences, parliamentary debates, and interviews. First empirical findings reveal that political elites regularly display overconfidence in their predictions of the development of the pandemic. Theoretically, I argue that this is especially problematic when situations are characterized by manifold unknowns, ambiguity and vagueness that cannot be resolved with more or better information (radical uncertainty). Hereby, this study makes an empirical and theoretical contribution to the literature on political elites’ judgment and decision making under uncertainty.	Behaviour and Opinion

Political Elites' Information Selection: A Pilot Study in Chile.	785	Despite the recent interest in misinformed politicians, few studies have considered the role of the procedure by which politicians choose what to focus on plays in their ability to understand constituents’ preferences. Information attention is important as, if politicians give disproportionate weight to certain information, this would introduce an important source of bias into their assessments of constituents' perspectives on different issues. Using a survey experiment design applied to political elites in Chile, this pilot study is the first attempt to fill this gap by examining whether politicians overestimate the relevance of information from personal experiences (episodic information) while ignoring statistical information (base rates). Moreover, this paper explores the influence interest groups have on this process by looking at whether they can persuade politicians to pay more attention to statistical information. The study's expected findings are that politicians do tend to focus more on personal experiences and that statistical information portrayed as originating from interest groups has a greater impact on them than information not framed in this way. This would suggest that politicians' understanding of constituent preferences is greatly dependent on how representative the group of people they pay attention to, is.	Behaviour and Opinion

Focus group research into political perspectives of divergent sociological groups	509	Decades of research into political trust has established many insights into levels of trust. Scholars view political trust as volatile, albeit not structurally declining, and find large differences in trust levels between sociological groups show. However, the meaning of this concept is all but settled (e.g. van der Meer 2010; Bertsou 2020; Valgarðsson et al. 2020). Theoretically, only a few scholars have proposed dimensions along which that citizens would evaluate their trust in political actors and/or institutions, leading to divergent conceptualizations. Empirically, studies come to different conclusions as to which dimensions matter (most) as well.Moreover, it is unclear whether the meaning of political trust is the same for all citizens. Studies into the understanding of political concepts show how particular positions in society come with particular world views through which political attitudes are constituted (Hochschild 2016; Cramer 2016).This paper asks the question what political trust entails for different sociological groups. Through two rounds of focus group interviews in Amsterdam (the Netherlands), I investigate the meaning of political trust among four groups of acquaintances, namely: lawyers from a large international firm, market vendors, vocational students and bridge club members. These groups represent respectively high educated winners of globalization, low educated losers of globalization, low educated youth and high educated elderly. I examine whether and how dimensions of political trust in the literature matter for each group. Furthermore, I establish how the meaning of political trust each group uses is embedded in their broader political perspectives.	Behaviour and Opinion

National governments have made use of exceptional powers to enforce lockdowns, often sacrificing civil liberties of all sorts, nurturing fears of an authoritarian turn. In this paper, we study citizens' responses to the democratic dilemmas the pandemic has . We present results from a set of survey experiments embedded in five survey waves conducted from March 2020 to September 2021, together with longitudinal evidence from a panel survey fielded right before the pandemic. Our findings reveal a strong initial increase of preferences for a national as opposed to a European/international response, widespread demand for strong leadership, willingness to give up individual freedom, and support for technocratic governance, much stronger for the COVID-19 crisis than for other global problems, such as climate change or international terrorism. Most of these sharp initial changes, though, seem to be slowly vanishing, except for mass public preferences towards technocratic and authoritarian government, which seem to remain high. We discuss to what extent this crisis may contribute to a shift towards a new, self-enforcing political equilibrium.	Behaviour and Opinion

Experimental Evidence from the Rollout of Covid-19 Vaccinations in England	1070	Most theories of democratic accountability presume that voters only evaluate governments over issues over which they bear responsibility. However, recent empirical work suggests that this characterisation is too simple, with many voters selectively attributing credit and blame to fit their partisan priors. Empirically adjudicating these mechanisms remains difficult, since both share observational equivalencies, and most existing studies focus on policies particularly prone to partisan bias, like the state of the economy.To overcome these issues we study the early phase of England’s Covid-19 vaccination rollout, a programme which was extremely popular across the political spectrum and for which the government unambigiously received credit. Using a survey experiment embedded in Wave 21 of the British Election Study Online Panel, we test whether information emphasising the Government or the National Health Service (NHS)’s role in the programme affects how voters allocate responsibility and evaluate the Government. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, we show that our NHS treatment has a large negative effect on perceived government responsibility. This effect, in turn, mediates a decline in government approval. Secondly, unlike previous studies, we are able to demonstrate that swing voters are actually less responsive to new information when determining responsibility. Thirdly, we find that voters’ personal experience, such as being at greater medical risk from COVID-19 or having been offered the vaccine, also affect their receptiveness to our informational primes. Our paper demonstrates that, under the right conditions, voters can impartically update their responsibility perceptions, and that this has downstream effects on government approval.

Experimental Evidence from the Rollout of Covid-19 Vaccinations in England	1070	Most theories of democratic accountability presume that voters only evaluate governments over issues over which they bear responsibility. However, recent empirical work suggests that this characterisation is too simple, with many voters selectively attributing credit and blame to fit their partisan priors. Empirically adjudicating these mechanisms remains difficult, since both share observational equivalencies, and most existing studies focus on policies particularly prone to partisan bias, like the state of the economy.To overcome these issues we study the early phase of England’s Covid-19 vaccination rollout, a programme which was extremely popular across the political spectrum and for which the government unambigiously received credit. Using a survey experiment embedded in Wave 21 of the British Election Study Online Panel, we test whether information emphasising the Government or the National Health Service (NHS)’s role in the programme affects how voters allocate responsibility and evaluate the Government. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, we show that our NHS treatment has a large negative effect on perceived government responsibility. This effect, in turn, mediates a decline in government approval. Secondly, unlike previous studies, we are able to demonstrate that swing voters are actually less responsive to new information when determining responsibility. Thirdly, we find that voters’ personal experience, such as being at greater medical risk from COVID-19 or having been offered the vaccine, also affect their receptiveness to our informational primes. Our paper demonstrates that, under the right conditions, voters can impartically update their responsibility perceptions, and that this has downstream effects on government approval.

However, this practice results in a significant variance of spatial district size due to increasingly heterogeneous population development.

We study this relationship by linking CSES individual-level data from six German elections with spatial district-level data. The German case covers both diversity in electoral district size and a major reform in 2002 reducing the number of electoral districts, which allows us to differentiate static effects of size from reactions to a district's modification. Results indicate that while geographic size does not generally affect citizens' perceptions of the democratic system and their influence on political outcomes, significant changes in electoral districts' borders towards larger districts adversely affect citizens' political efficacy. If changing an electoral district is more harmful than maintaining electoral inequality due to heterogeneous population size, policymakers must more carefully weigh such a measure's consequences before implementation.

However, critical events and threats often require the implementation of unpopular political measures that challenge the current status quo of societal status arrangements and may thus elicit anger and eroding political support. Political measures may also become increasingly unpopular over time as they put a strain on civil liberties (e.g., in case of state surveillance) or require cuts in financial support and public services. This study examines citizens’ political support in the context of mass immigration, climate change, and gender equity. Specifically, we argue that change-adverse constituents particularly respond with eroding political support if two conditions are present at the same time: First, governments have actually implemented policies that potentially challenge the status quo, such as a liberal immigrant integration policy, a strong policy measures aimed at tackling climate change, or laws regarding gender parity (women's quota). Second, a successful (right-wing) populist party is present, which attributes blame to government authorities by rendering changes to the status quo as illegitimate and against the will of the “pure people”. Empirical results from longitudinal multi-level regressions using data from the European Social Survey combined with policy measures and share of votes for right-wing parties support the contention that the combination of liberal policies and right-wing populism represents a catalyst for eroding political support of citizens who oppose change to the status quo.

There is academic debate on the extent to which the relationship between opposition and governing parties has become ‘blurred’ in policymaking and procedural running of parliament, but it is unclear how voters respond to it. In this paper, I study whether and how voters react to parliamentary distinctiveness (PD) of government and opposition parties. I hypothesize that the relationship between the levels of government-opposition parliamentary distinctiveness and democratic legitimacy in general elections is curvilinear: moderate levels of distinctiveness are positively, but low and high levels are negatively related to the measures of democratic legitimacy. I also suggest that voters’ reaction to the lack of distinctiveness in the parliamentary arena is moderated by their group partisan identity – whether they supported the incumbent or the opposition at the previous elections. I use multilevel analysis of survey data and legislative data spanning from the 1960s to 2010s from The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, and Denmark, to study the effect of PD on individuals’ democratic satisfaction, trust in parliament, and electoral turnout. I operationalize government-opposition distinctiveness in behavioral terms as 1) a percentage of legislative votes in which parties voted similarly to the largest governing party; 2) a share of bills or proposals supported by the opposition or governing party. I compare the impact of PD on voters at the aggregate, group, and individual levels.	Behaviour and Opinion

Coalition governments may be better (or worse) than single party governments in keeping their promises, better (or worse) than single party governments at being responsive to public opinion or better (or worse) at being decisive. Citizens, then, can evaluate coalition governance according to a number of different criteria. It can be hard to properly evaluate citizen views on these attributes if, for example, a particular setting only has experience of one form of governance. Furthermore, without some capacity to incorporate changing context, it can be hard to disentangle whether evaluations of coalition governance reflect underlying predispositions over what voters value or, rather, reflect responses to lived experiences under single- versus multi-party governments. A new data set which pools responses from over 20 years of citizen responses helps to address these questions. This period in New Zealand’s political history is marked by alternation in forms of government (single- versus multi-party) which means that respondents have direct experience of different types of government and, also, means that we are able to examine responses to government alongside questions of more underlying predispositions. We find that, while voters do have preferred forms of government, that popular views do respond both systematically and significantly to the actual form of government itself.	Behaviour and Opinion

Unexpected Election Outcomes and Satisfaction with Democracy	48	Regularly-held elections are one of the main mechanisms to regulate conflicts in democratic societies. Provided that the rules are fair, it is expected that citizens will accept the outcome of an election whether they are on the winning side or the losing side. Hence, citizens’ support for and satisfaction with democracy are essential for the stability and longevity of democratic institutions as well as the peaceful alternation of power. However, a great amount of research has noted the existence of a gap between winners and losers in relation to satisfaction with democracy. One aspect of the winner–loser gap that has been overlooked is the impact of citizens’ expectations and the strength of these expectations on their level of satisfaction with democracy. More precisely, how do citizens react to unexpected winners and losers? Are individuals on the losing side less dissatisfied when they recognize that their favourite party or candidate was likely to be defeated at the polls? Does experiencing a surprise victory lead to a boost in satisfaction? To answer these questions, I use data from multiple national and regional elections held in Canada, France, Scotland, and the United States.	Behaviour and Opinion

Evidence from Spanish Election Results	691	Recent proposals from the US and European left have used the urgent need for climate change action as an opportunity for a “Green New Deal” (GND), involving large-scale public investment into energy, transport and housing systems, with an explicit focus on improving the lives of the working class. Advocates of GND-style policies argue that they are likely to be much more politically popular than conventional climate policies, such as carbon taxes. Yet, little is known about how GND-style policies fare electorally.

A cross-country study	1133	Up until now most research has focused on public beliefs about anthropogenic climate change or, in other words, on whether the public accepts the scientific consensus that climate change is happening. However, a key aspect on public opinion still remains unresolved: are attitudes towards climate change and climate change beliefs more acute in places more affected by the rise in sea level, the change in temperatures or the occurrences of climate disasters? Do people react to the change in climate or, as some argue, the climate changes are so minimal in the short-run that are not perceived by the population? This article studies public opinion on climate change and on climate policies as a function of objective changes in temperature, floods, fire or hurricane occurrence. We use data coming from the module ‘Public Attitudes to Climate Change’ from the European Social Survey in 2016 (44,387 respondents from 23 countries), as well as from the Prudence project, which includes the evolution of several climate indicators at a very fine-grained level of geographical aggregation. Linking the regional variation of climate change phenomena and public opinion at NUTS-2 level, we are able to explore not only whether changes in the environment make people more likely to believe on climate change, but also its impact on people’s support on policy measures to tackle it.

How Environmental Parties in Governments Affect Environmental Protection Performance.	298	Green parties have unique ownership over environmental and climate protection issues in party competition. However, it remains controversial, whether they truly promote climate protection policies, that in turn affect countries' environmental protection achievements. In this paper, I address this question by analyzing the effect of green parties' government participation on policy outputs and countries' environmental protection performance. To this end I adopt a comparative approach, analyzing a large sample of European countries that have or not have been governed by green parties in the past. To study green parties' overall impact, I not only focus on governments' policy outputs but also countries' environmental protection performance. Taking into account two different dependent variables yields more general empirical findings and a more cohesive substantial analysis. Methodologically, I follow a multi-method approach combining classical regression analysis with synthetic control methods. My findings have important implications for the literature on party competition on climate protection, issue ownership, and more generally the role of green parties in legislative democracies.

How Changes in Subnational Trade Competitiveness Matter for Incumbents' Vote Shares	895	The economic voting literature suggests that voters reward incumbents with re-election when the country prospers economically, whereas they fail to re-elect them when the economic situation of the country worsens. This literature has mainly focused on domestic economic indicators, such as inflation or unemployment, and mainly looked at changes in the economic situation of the country as a whole. Using a novel dataset that measures subnational trade competitiveness in more than 30 countries, we consider how the international economy matters for vote choice and also leverage within-country variation in economic fortunes. We find support for two expectations: decreases in subnational trade competitiveness lead to lower vote shares for incumbents, and this effect is particularly pronounced in presidential systems. In doing so, the paper not only speaks to the economic voting literature but also to studies on the consequences of globalization and political economy more generally.	Political Economy

While the concept of ownership has featured highly in recent academic and policy debates over the effects of IO conditionality, it still remains elusive, ill-identified, and under-specified. In this paper, we focus on International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs and define local ownership with respect to the counterfactual level of de jure structural reforms that would be achieved in the absence of IMF conditionality. We then use the synthetic control method (SCM) to identify continuous levels of ownership as a function of a treatment effect on treated compliers (TETC) and operationalize the concept of ownership over external- and financial-sector conditionality across a restricted sample of uninterrupted IMF arrangements (1980-2014). Furthermore, we probe the criterion and construct validity of our measure with respect to known determinants, proxies, and outcomes of ownership. We argue that ours is a reliable, replicable, valid, robust, and systematic measure of ownership that can help better identify and estimate the indirect relationship between program design and policy implementation.

Reputations, FDI, and Contract Breach	146	A central problem facing foreign investors is whether host-governments will violate their contracts once investments are made. A common mechanism through which states can overcome this commitment problem is by cultivating reputations in the eyes of potential investors. Yet we do not know how states’ current reputations shape their incentives to breach contract. I borrow a theory from recent work on reputation dynamics (Baser 2020; Phelan 2006) and argue that states with better reputations for treating foreign investors face stronger incentives to breac! h contrac t. An empirical implication is that, in the face of adverse exogenous economic shocks, states will exhibit differential tendencies to breach contract depending on their reputations. To test this prediction, I leverage as-if random occurrence of natural disasters. I find that states with good reputations for treating foreign investors are more likely to breach contract as a result of disasters. The results indicate that reputational concerns constrain states’ temptation to expropriate foreign property, but this constraining power wanes as reputations improve.	Political Economy

Salient environmental events such as floods and droughts have been shown to increase pro-environmental voting or support for incumbents. In this paper, we posit that environmental change can also spur societal polarization. In particular, environmental change creates clear winners and losers who then turn toward parties that take more extreme positions on the environment. To test this argument, we study the re-emergence of the wolf in Western Central Europe. After having been extinguished by 1900, environmental change has allowed the wolf to make an impressive and unforeseen comeback. Yet, while conservationists applaud the wolf's reemergence, farmers and livestock owners experience significant economic losses. To assess whether the wolf spurs polarization, we collect fine-grained spatial data on wolf attacks in Germany and construct a 30-year municipality-level panel of voting behavior. Using modern difference-in-differences estimators, preliminary results show that wolf attacks help the radical right, while they hurt center-left parties, including the Greens. Turning to mechanisms, we argue that radical parties frame the wolf's reemergence as a symbol of ""elite aloofness,"" which moves voters away from mainstream parties.	Behaviour and Opinion

These studies have focused on demographic characteristics, personality traits and values associated with ideological proximity to populism, a political opportunity structure favoring populism, and models of social identity and group competition. We propose and test a novel mechanism—the FA-BA (Frustration Anxiety-Blame Anger) model—that matches the core characteristics of populism with directly associated emotions experienced by voters. Confirming the predictions of the FA-BA model, populist voters experience higher levels of targeted frustration and anxiety, anger, and blame attribution but do not differ from other voters with regard to overall life satisfaction and general positive or negative affect. Furthermore, frustration and anxiety are transformed into anger via blame attribution. As predicted, frustration and anxiety do not increase the likelihood that a voter will cast a populist vote. Conversely, anger, enthusiasm, and blame attribution are strongly associated with casting a populist vote—with the path from blame attribution via enthusiasm emerging as central mechanism explaining populist votes. Overall, the findings support the FA-BA model, have important implications for understanding the strategies of the populist right and the related emotional mechanisms underlying voters’ choices, and point to potential dangers of populist strategies.

While media narratives largely point to failures to reform gun laws at the national level, the enforcement of firearm laws would actually fall on local law enforcement leaders. We focus on county sheriffs, who are law enforcement leaders elected via popular vote across the United States. This group also supports gun rights in a variety of ways, including via symbolic stances and refusals to enforce state-level gun control laws. We examine sheriff’s attitudes about guns as tool for understanding more about views of guns more generally. We first establish that sheriff’s views on guns are extreme: their preferences for gun rights are very different than the public, rank-and-file law enforcement, or people that live in their counties. Drawing on scholarship about gun attitudes in the general US population, we develop hypotheses about the role of place, politics, and individual characteristics of sheriffs. We assess sheriffs’ attitudinal support for gun rights from two original surveys (conducted a decade apart, each with more than 500 respondents) of sheriffs. We compliment the survey data with observational data on sheriffs’ support for gun rights via public statements opposing gun control efforts at the national level and the creation of second amendment sanctuary counties. Our research contributes to our understanding of gun control, elite behavior, and policy implementation.	Behaviour and Opinion

Adherence to PICTs is driven by right-wing media consumption (QAnon), and partisanship (2020 Presidential Election). Over-reporting of PICTs is most common among those with conspiratorial ideation. While the prevalence of PICTs is commonly over-estimated and the beliefs may be ephemeral, they can serve an instrumental role motivating the contemporary American electorate.	Behaviour and Opinion

Investigating determinants of public support for surveillance	549	The rapidly changing world creates actual or perceived insecurities for many people. As a response to security threats, governments around the globe, albeit in different magnitude, have implemented measures of mass surveillance. Regardless of prominent (normative) debates on surveillance and security, studies examining individual attitudes and factors explaining them have been relatively scarce. While people in general prefer living in a secure environment, we argue that it is not only the imminent trade-off between security concerns and protecting one’s privacy and freedom that ultimately persuades citizens to support surveillance measures. We expect that the support of such policies also depends on financial costs, their impact on individual convenience, the design of the policies as well as the context in which they are implemented. With the underlying study, we contribute to the literature by increasing our understanding of what makes people agree to proposed security measures and how efficient they perceive them to be.Using a factorial survey experiment, we measure the causal effects of the threat level, the strength of privacy interventions, financial costs, and time resources on the approval of security measures and their expected efficiency. The pre-registered experiment was conducted with 5,000 respondents in Germany. Results show that German citizens are in general willing to accept the introduction of far-reaching surveillance measures, but that related financial costs and individual convenience significantly influence such support. Context, in this case whether a safety threat is salient, however, has no effect on individual support.	Behaviour and Opinion

While media narratives largely point to failures to reform gun laws at the national level, the enforcement of firearm laws would actually fall on local law enforcement leaders. We focus on county sheriffs, who are law enforcement leaders elected via popular vote across the United States. This group also supports gun rights in a variety of ways, including via symbolic stances and refusals to enforce state-level gun control laws. We examine sheriff’s attitudes about guns as tool for understanding more about views of guns more generally. We first establish that sheriff’s views on guns are extreme: their preferences for gun rights are very different than the public, rank-and-file law enforcement, or people that live in their counties. Drawing on scholarship about gun attitudes in the general US population, we develop hypotheses about the role of place, politics, and individual characteristics of sheriffs. We assess sheriffs’ attitudinal support for gun rights from two original surveys (conducted a decade apart, each with more than 500 respondents) of sheriffs. We compliment the survey data with observational data on sheriffs’ support for gun rights via public statements opposing gun control efforts at the national level and the creation of second amendment sanctuary counties. Our research contributes to our understanding of gun control, elite behavior, and policy implementation.	Behaviour and Opinion

This paper argues that voters formulate expectations about politicians' future behavior concerning hiring decisions with respect to municipal and state jobs based on the local roots these candidates' possess. Drawing on survey experiments (N=1000) in Hungary, the study shows that politicians appointing (or influencing the appointment of) people from their hometown is a form of behavioral localism, expected by voters. A vignette experiment demonstrates that when local politicians are elected as MPs (as opposed to carpetbaggers), respondents find it more likely that applicants who have shared local roots with the politician will be able to obtain jobs in the public sector, even if they lack the necessary qualifications for the position. Furthermore, a choice-based conjoint experiment suggests that respondents themselves are more willing to fire non-local employees, public servants' local ties (or lack thereof) having comparable effect sizes on the likelihood of getting fired to being co/out-partisans of survey takers. Respondents also believe that their stated preferences, revealed during the conjoint experiment, reflect the behavior of real-world top bureaucrats. These findings refine our understanding on patronage as behavioral localism, as well as voters' expectations about likely non-programmatic behavior of elected candidates.	Behaviour and Opinion

This work usually finds that poorer citizens appear to exert lower political influence than richer citizens.Most of these studies have focused on formal, national-level policies, mainly in Western countries. However, in rother world regions crucial distributional outputs from politics operate through personal clientelistic relations with politicians and through the allocation of local public goods to communities that mobilize to exert pressure, in addition to formal channels. This paper uses existing public opinion and expert surveys to study variation and drivers of perceived political influence in the form of perceptions about how much politicians listen to or respond to citizens’ demands. In a preliminary analysis, we find great variation in inequality of perceived political influence and no clear overall tendency across countries for wealthier citizens to display higher perceived political influence than poorer citizens. This cross-country variation in inequality in perceived political influence will be substantiated across different opinions surveys and other available measures of political inequality.To explore the extent to which inequality in perceived political influence might be driven by informal distributive politics, we undertake two types of analysis: at the individual level and at the country level. At the individual level, we explore whether protest participation and clientelistic linkages mediate the relation between socioeconomic background and perceived political influence. At the country level, we study whether the extent and type of clientelism and macro-indicators of service delivery protests correlate with inequality of political influence.	Comparative Politics

In applied domains, this suggests that delimited policy initiatives may incite sweeping beneficial changes in behaviour. The risk, however, is that ordinary processes like individual heterogeneity and identity concerns might restructure or even undermine tipping in ways policy makers do not understand. To examine this possibility, we implemented an experiment before and after the fractious 2020 election for U.S. President. Participants played coordination games in groups of either Republicans or Democrats. Repeated play allowed groups to develop local norms. Once a group had established a norm, we exposed a subset of group members to an intervention that promoted an alternative group-beneficial norm. In our control treatment, choice options were labelled with neutral symbols. In our identity treatment, options were labelled with partisan political images designed to activate group identities and associated affective responses. We test whether this simple relabelling generated extreme differences in cultural dynamics. We expected that with neutral labels, groups transition to new norms quickly after an intervention. Under political labels, however, we test whether it is possible for groups to persist in a state of chronic disagreement after intervention, with large opportunity costs being the net result. In short we test, whether tipping points are powerful but fragile. Do group identities accelerate beneficial changes in local culture when choice and identity are unrelated? Can even a trivial link between choice and identity destroy the effect entirely?	Behaviour and Opinion

Recently, however, a number of once powerful European center-right parties suffered losses at the ballot box and became exposed to increasing pressure from the populist radical right. A historical defeat of German Christian Democrats at the 2021 Bundestag election demonstrates that even most successful center-right parties are affected by the symptoms of crisis. Drawing on Gidron and Ziblatt (2019: 29) it may be concluded that the general cause of the problems experienced currently by the center-right is “unbundling” of conservative attitudes. The mechanism explaining this process has, however, not been examined in detail so far. The comparison of survey data from the German 2021 federal election with data from federal elections conducted in 2017, 2013 and 2009 can clarify this puzzle. This study argues for the central role of tensions between religiosity and other indicators of “mainstream conservatism” on the one hand and attitudes towards migration on the other. Two other factors played however also an important role and further accelerated segmentation of center-right. The first was diminishing size of the most devoted section of traditional Christian-Democratic electorate due to secularization. The second was moderation of positions of mainstream center-right parties which came as a response to social change.	Behaviour and Opinion

Faced with the numeric decline of the working-class, Social Democracy has been targeting voter segments from the middle classes over the mobilization of traditional working-class constituencies, emphasizing cultural over economic issues, which has resulted in a de-politicization of conflicts around distribution and inequality. Hence, the increasing salience of the authoritarian-libertarian increased the attractiveness of right-wing populist parties for working class voters, who were always rather conservative on cultural issues. In short, the decline of Social Democracy and the rise of right-wing populism appear as two sides of the same coin.Focussing on the German case, we challenge this literature in two ways: first, we show that the working-class support of right-wing populist parties is rather modest. Second, we show that the rise of right-wing populist parties is more related to the support for the Christian Democrats and patterns of religious voting. Beside the German-Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) cross-section samples from 2013 we rely on the cumulated GLES online tracking studies conducted three to four times a year since 2009. Our contribution resonates with the concern that political science tends too often to overlook the potential role of the Centre-Right and Christian Democracy for explanations of contemporary political trends and phenomena.

Class, education and voting in Germany in long-term perspective	995	I has often been claimed in recent literature that class voting is in decline and issues related to economic inequality give way to cultural issues, related to divisions over authoritarian and libertarian values, and that education as the structural basis of these conflicts as a new social cleavage in voting behaviour (e.g. Stubager 2010, 2013). Yet it also been argued that education is just one aspect of class beside income, which continues to be related to the traditional economic left-right dimension (e.g. van der Waal et al. 2007).(West) Germany is a case that is unique in allowing to test the validity of these notions, in so far as both the economic left-right dimension and dimension related to cultural issues find sufficiently strong expression in the party system and as a relatively long time series of election study data is available. We make use of this opportunity and by analysing a long-term compilation of German electoral studies from 1949 to 2021 and by examining the long-term dynamics “socio-economic” and “educational voting”. With additional focus on the most recent elections of 2013 through 2021 we examine the contribution of income and education to recent changes in voting behaviour, in particular, the rise of the right-wing “Alternative for Germany” (AfD) and the left-libertarian Green party.

This study aims at assessing the effects of religiosity on vote choice in Poland, a country of very strong Catholic tradition that has only started to experience secularization and one of the few countries in which religiosity is associated with voting for populist radical right parties. We argue that, contrary to what is happening in Western Europe, in Poland, the decreasing levels of religiosity in the context of a growing presence of politicized religious or moral issues in the public sphere and high political influence of the Catholic Church amplify the importance of religion as a determinant of voting. Using Polish National Election Study data from 1997 to 2019, we show that the public aspects of religiosity (church attendance and the activation of conflicts by ecclesiastical and political elites) related to feelings of belonging affect voting to a greater degree than the more personal dimension of religious belief. In this study, we conceive political parties as social coalitions (Bawn et al. 2012) and, thus, we also emphasize the role of religious interest groups and activists, particularly in the case of the governing Law and Justice party. We conclude by discussing the implications and generalizability of these findings to other contexts in search of explanations to the paradox of the continuity of the influence of religion on voting regardless of the secularization processes.

We argue that, contrary to what is happening in Western Europe, in Poland, the decreasing levels of religiosity in the context of a growing presence of politicized religious or moral issues in the public sphere and high political influence of the Catholic Church amplify the importance of religion as a determinant of voting. Using Polish National Election Study data from 1997 to 2019, we show that the public aspects of religiosity (church attendance and the activation of conflicts by ecclesiastical and political elites) related to feelings of belonging affect voting to a greater degree than the more personal dimension of religious belief. In this study, we conceive political parties as social coalitions (Bawn et al. 2012) and, thus, we also emphasize the role of religious interest groups and activists, particularly in the case of the governing Law and Justice party. We conclude by discussing the implications and generalizability of these findings to other contexts in search of explanations to the paradox of the continuity of the influence of religion on voting regardless of the secularization processes.

Faced with the numeric decline of the working-class, Social Democracy has been targeting voter segments from the middle classes over the mobilization of traditional working-class constituencies, emphasizing cultural over economic issues, which has resulted in a de-politicization of conflicts around distribution and inequality. Hence, the increasing salience of the authoritarian-libertarian increased the attractiveness of right-wing populist parties for working class voters, who were always rather conservative on cultural issues. In short, the decline of Social Democracy and the rise of right-wing populism appear as two sides of the same coin.Focussing on the German case, we challenge this literature in two ways: first, we show that the working-class support of right-wing populist parties is rather modest. Second, we show that the rise of right-wing populist parties is more related to the support for the Christian Democrats and patterns of religious voting. Beside the German-Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) cross-section samples from 2013 we rely on the cumulated GLES online tracking studies conducted three to four times a year since 2009. Our contribution resonates with the concern that political science tends too often to overlook the potential role of the Centre-Right and Christian Democracy for explanations of contemporary political trends and phenomena.

Class, education and voting in Germany in long-term perspective	995	I has often been claimed in recent literature that class voting is in decline and issues related to economic inequality give way to cultural issues, related to divisions over authoritarian and libertarian values, and that education as the structural basis of these conflicts as a new social cleavage in voting behaviour (e.g. Stubager 2010, 2013). Yet it also been argued that education is just one aspect of class beside income, which continues to be related to the traditional economic left-right dimension (e.g. van der Waal et al. 2007).(West) Germany is a case that is unique in allowing to test the validity of these notions, in so far as both the economic left-right dimension and dimension related to cultural issues find sufficiently strong expression in the party system and as a relatively long time series of election study data is available. We make use of this opportunity and by analysing a long-term compilation of German electoral studies from 1949 to 2021 and by examining the long-term dynamics “socio-economic” and “educational voting”. With additional focus on the most recent elections of 2013 through 2021 we examine the contribution of income and education to recent changes in voting behaviour, in particular, the rise of the right-wing “Alternative for Germany” (AfD) and the left-libertarian Green party.

Danish voters trust their political institutions and express satisfaction with their democracy. One reason frequently mentioned is that the voters’ can express their preferences at elections. Yet, is Denmark, in fact, a democratic leader, a beacon of light in the political darkness? Or is it merely some unworkable utopian outlier?We attempt to provide an answer by analyzing voter data from national studies in Denmark and several other advanced democracies spanning multiple decades. The analysis focus on a comparison of three normatively relevant measures of democratic performance: voice, choice, and satisfaction. Voice refers the degree to which voters can participate in the system. Choice refers to the range of viable party choices. Satisfaction has two aspects; one specific and one diffuse. Specific satisfaction concerns support for the working of election rules. Diffuse support concerns more affective feelings about the system as a whole. The unit of analysis is the country, measured over time, via public opinion and aggregate statistical indicators. In combination, the three measures provide an index of democratic performance, country by country. To the extent Denmark obtains higher performance scores than other Western democracies, it will continue to be seen as a ”beacon of light.”We need an answer because Denmark – like other Western democracy – has come under pressure to uphold economic prosperity while accommodating increasing diversity from immigration. These developments might challenge voters’ opportunities to be represented in the political system, in Denmark as well as beyond.	Behaviour and Opinion

Moreover, subjective factors such as partisan preferences affect how they perceive the election results. In this paper, we study the influence of media framing on citizens’ perceptions of election winners and losers. We argue that such media framing affects whether voters perceive a party as an election winner or loser. We test this expectation based on two pre-registered studies: first, a survey experiment with randomized news frames of an otherwise identical election result and second, a two-wave (pre-post) survey and media content analysis in the context of the 2021 German election. Preliminary results from the experiment suggest that positive (negative) framing of election results influences voter perceptions of winners (losers). The results also corroborate our expectation that respondents are more likely to identify parties as election winners (losers) if they like (dislike) the respective party. Yet, we find no evidence for our expectation that framing effects are strongest for voters with a moderate level of party sympathy; positive (negative) framing effects tend to be strongest among respondents who like (dislike) the respective party. Our second study, which is still being finalised, additionally allows assessing the extent to which voters perceive certain parties as legitimate or not.

I introduce ‘post-truth’ as a discourse, drawing from the psychoanalytic elements of lack and fantasy along with the fantasmatic logic of explanation, to identify and measure it. In this framework, a ‘post-truth’ discourse embodies lack, fantasy, and emotionality, intertwining to present a fantasmatic logic. I test the truthfulness of ‘post-truth’ discourse in Pakistan in a two-step design. First, I employ a qualitative text analysis to national newspaper articles to detect ‘post-truth’ accounts. Based on this categorization, I design a vignette survey experiment to test the causal relationship between ‘post-truth’ narratives and truthfulness. I surveyed a random sample of 800 respondents from five urban districts in Pakistan. I find that the persuasiveness of post-truth narratives varies across issues but the impact of trust in the source is constant in accepting ‘post-truth’ account as being truthful. Despite overall null results for truthfulness of a ‘post-truth’ account, I highlight how the types of specific discourses, as well as the positive correlation between different types of sentiments (anger and hope) and truthfulness of a ‘post-truth’ account paves the way to further study the interplay between ‘post-truth’ discourse, emotions, and political behaviour.

We offer a set of potential explanations why and under which conditions voters may prefer this seemingly riskier political alternative to the safer choice, and test these explanations using data from Germany and Austria. Our empirical analysis offers support for a negative direct effect of risk aversion on far-right voting, and a positive indirect effect of risk aversion on far-right voting (through conservative attitudes). Moreover, we find that the perception of future economic losses compared to the status quo increases far-right voting.

Right-wing terrorism and political behavior in Hungary	687	Despite the growing right-wing terrorist threat in Europe, the effects of extreme-right violence on political behavior remain understudied. Especially little is known about the impact of right-wing extremist violence against minorities on the electoral performance of mostly non-violent radical right parties. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the electoral effect of the 2008-2009 terrorist attacks against Roma minority members in Hungary, the most significant case of domestic ethnic violence since WWII. The attacks preceded the radical right Jobbik's rise national prominence in the European and national parliamentary elections of 2009 and 2010, where it ran on an explicitly anti-Roma platform. To estimate the effect of exposure to terrorism – proxied as a binary measure of geographic proximity – on Jobbik's vote share at the precinct level, I utilize the spatial variation in targeted localities. To identify causal effects, I make use of a natural experiment in which the control group contains localities where perpetrators planned further attacks prior to their arrest. Difference-in-differences regression models with varying specifications demonstrate that the attacks' effect on Jobbik’s support and turnout was small, mostly negative and insignificant statistically. The results contradict most existing research which showed that terrorism is associated with profound changes in electoral behavior but failed to consider that electoral outcomes are endogenous to terrorists' target selection criteria.

Scholars argue that people living in places that are economically disadvantaged and relatively deprived are feeling left behind by globalisation, society, and/or politics. This feeling of lacking societal recognition possibly fuels political discontent and distrust. However, this two-step mechanism has rarely been tested directly (McKay et al. 2021) with previous studies often focusing on either the attitudinal level (Gidron and Hall 2020) or the direct, aggregate-level effects of local contexts on voting behaviour (Scala and Johnson 2017).To add to this line of research, this paper examines whether the individuals’ living place affects their feeling of lacking societal recognition and subsequently, contribute to political distrust.The study focuses on Germany as a particularly interesting case because of the inconclusive picture of regional inequalities relating to political discontent and populist right-wing voting behaviour. I will use georeferenced survey data based on a probabilistic sample of the German Longitudinal Election Study 2021. First, I will analyze the association of living in a ‘left behind place’ and the subjective ‘feeling of being left behind’ by relying on fine-grained measures of local living conditions - such as economic situation, access to infrastructure, and rurality - and a multidimensional measurement of perceived societal recognition. Subsequently, I will test if the lack of societal recognition is associated with political distrust. Thirdly, the analyses are integrated to test the underlying mediation model.	Behaviour and Opinion

Previous literature has shown that individual trust and welfare state institutions tend to reinforce each other. However, more recent work, aiming at disentangling the causal relationship between the two has shown that the association is more complex and that results are more mixed than theoretically expected. Trust might have different effects on one's social policy preferences depending on many environmental factors. First, the capacity of the state to effectively provide social protection in an optimal way, and second, the available alternative, namely, the availability of strong informal solidarity networks. I argue that while individuals who believe others to be trustworthy will support a cooperative effort to build solidarity networks and insure together each citizen from social risks, their likelihood to support a state-led effort to provide social insurance will depend on the quality of government institution and the strength of civil society. I test this argument leveraging survey data from the European Social Survey in combination with administrative and regional data, as well as country specific survey and administrative data. I test my expectations, providing evidence that the effect of trust on social policy preferences can only be theorised and investigated into context.	Behaviour and Opinion

One way to address this crisis is to substantially increase the supply of housing in these areas. This article presents new evidence on why this is often very difficult. Using surveys and experiments in Denmark and the United States ($n=7,504$), we show that opposition to the construction of new housing is concentrated in expensive areas. We argue that this concentration of opposition to new construction in expensive areas is driven by selection into these areas by people with a strong preference over what their neighborhood looks like. That is, only people with a strong preference for a specific neighborhood’s character are willing to pay what it costs to live in an expensive area. In line with this explanation, we find that those who live in more expensive areas are more inclined to believe that the character of their community is worth preserving. These findings carry sombre implications for activist who want to build more housing in expensive cities.	Behaviour and Opinion

Political economists typically expect that workers finely condition their support of the welfare state according to their current risk exposure. In contrast, the bouned rationality approach expects that risk exposure only increases welfare demand when it is reasonable to assume that workers are aware of their risk exposure and when future-related concerns are currently salient. The theory is tested with longitudinal data from Switzerland and repeated cross-sections from 28 European countries. It evaluates to what extent workers increase their welfare demand over time when their risk exposure increases, which allows for more credible effect identification compared to the usual cross-sectional approach. The empirical analysis supports bounded rationality theory. Swiss workers only optimize their welfare preferences in a forward-looking manner when they become unemployed, and only the national unemployment rate is found to increase welfare demand in European countries. In contrast, a variety of risks on the occupational and individual level drawn from previous research (e.g., occupational unemployment, temporary employment contract) are found to be unrelated with welfare preferences. The implication is that the risk exposure of employed workers may matter less for their welfare preferences and downstream political phenomena such as voting behavior than commonly expected. Primarily the realized risk unemployment seems to matter.	Behaviour and Opinion

To estimate legacy effects, studies typically compare people living in places that were historically exposed to some event and those that were not. Using principal stratification, we provide a formal framework to analyze how migration limits our ability to learn about the persistent effects of history from observed differences between historically exposed and unexposed places. We state the necessary assumptions about movement behavior to causally identify legacy effects. We highlight that these assumptions are strong; therefore, we recommend that legacy studies circumvent bias by collecting data on people's place of residence at the exposure time. Reexamining a study on the persistent effects of US civil-rights protests, we show that observed attitudinal differences between residents and non-residents of historic protest sites are more likely due to migration rather than attitudinal change.

Although collider bias is usually considered something to be avoided, this paper argues, first: that collider bias can also have *positive* consequences for causal inference, e.g. in matching analyses, provided it are appropriately generated, and second: that positive uses of collider bias are examples of a more general strategy of inducing 'unfaithfulness' to the presumed underlying DAG. (A set of observed associations are unfaithful to a graph when they do not show all the conditional indepencies that the graph implies - under normal conditions, a measure zero event.) The paper concludes by considering the closely related problem of representing control and other equilibrium-type relations in DAGs. Control and monitoring relationships are both classic examples of graph unfaithfulness and currently hard to represent in a DAG framework, despite their ubiquity in political science research.

One prominent trigger of citizens’ support for dominant leaders is presence of intergroup conflict and the tendency to perceive the social world as inherently conflict-ridden. However, the concept of “dominant leaders” is less clearly understood. In this article, we clarify the concept of dominant leaders building on recent theoretical syntheses about social perceptions from the psychological sciences. Subsequently, the concept of dominant leaders is operationalized based on two well-validated models of personality impressions, The Big Five and HEXACO models, leading to novel predictions about citizen preferences for leader personality in times of conflict and peace. We test these predictions across four original empirical survey experiments from three countries (Denmark, Germany and the United States). Results reveal that citizens in times of threats from intergroup conflict prefer leaders who are less agreeable, humble, honest and open to new experiences (with results for the remaining personality dimensions being more mixed). Importantly, this pattern does not obtain for disease threats (Study 3), while it replicates across two kinds of intergroup conflicts, terrorist attacks and interstate aggression (Study 4). This suggests that citizen preferences for leader personality is distinctly attuned to threats of intergroup conflict. Results are discussed in relation to theoretical models of leader evaluations and implications for political leaders and citizens.	Behaviour and Opinion

Although several authors have addressed this question the results are far from being conclusive. In this study I focus on two facets of political stability –the vote for incumbent candidates and their reelection rates– and test whether candidate polarization conditions the support for incumbents. To do so, I apply a Regression Discontinuity Design to data from 5,036 legislative and cantonal electoral districts in France. These elections use a two-round system in which the two most voted candidates in the first round automatically qualify for the second round. Following the logic of ‘close race elections’, I analyze cases in which incumbents qualify first in the first round and use the vote share of candidates who rank second in the first round as the qualifying threshold that third candidates would need to reach to qualify for the second round. I then compute the ideological distances between incumbents, second and third candidates to determine whether the presence of second candidates increases/decreases the level of polarization in the second round. Overall, results show that polarization, understood as the degree of ideological divergence between incumbents and runner-up candidates, clearly benefits incumbents in terms of vote share and re-election rates. Moreover, I show that this effect is particularly strong when I restrict the analyses to cases in which incumbents face an extreme-left/right candidate in the second round.	Behaviour and Opinion

Mass and party polarization on immigration in Europe	845	Much of the existing research on public attitudes toward immigration focuses on their drivers and political consequences. However, we know less about mass polarization on this issue and the extent to which it is influenced by party system polarization, a factor shown in previous research to affect public opinion on a variety of issues. While existing research on elite influences on voters posits partisan cue-taking as a key mechanism, the impact on non-partisans is less clear-cut. This paper examines how partisans and non-partisans respond to elite polarization on immigration in European countries. It addresses this question by employing time-series cross-section data analyses covering seventeen European countries between 2002 and 2019 (relying on data from the European Social Survey for individual attitudes to immigration, and the Comparative Manifesto Project for party positions on immigration), coupled with additional analyses using panel data (relying on data from the British Election Study Internet Panel) as well as an instrumental variable approach. Preliminary results suggest that the impact of elite polarization on mass polarization is moderated by partisanship and the election context (i.e. whether the election features the electoral breakthrough of a radical right anti-immigration party).

However, political debates driven by public demands for government regulation of supply chains have erupted in many societies of the Global North. Despite its saliency, this emerging area of globalization politics and especially, individual-level preference formation mechanisms remain poorly understood.Our study investigates which political mandates citizens endow their policymakers with to intervene in global production and why. We implemented vignette and conjoint survey-embedded experiments with representative samples in the 12 largest high-income importing OECD member economies (N=24,000). Overall, we find that citizens prefer policy instruments which apply to medium- and large-sized companies, support stringent reporting requirements and strong sanctioning provisions. Moreover, support for regulation is partly driven by protectionist motives and by demands for consumer protection.We contribute to a growing literature in the political sciences that examines which types of policy approaches (voluntary/bottom-up vs governmental/top-down) garner public support. Moreover, we extend the current literature on globalization backlash dynamics by a detailed analysis of how individuals form preferences on international business and trade against the backdrop of increasing awareness of environmental and social footprint shifting.Our study implies that over the last decade, public opinion on this emerging policy topic has matured. Hence, the sustainability of global production might continue to encroach on agendas in the political mainstream.	Behaviour and Opinion

However, we know little about the impact these restrictions on policy views, especially preferences for policies with similar public good problems such as the environment. We tackle these questions by focusing on the effect of recent pandemic regulations on environmental attitudes in Europe, where the management of COVID infections has varied across and within countries. Recent literature argues that lockdowns have nudged citizens to care more about the environment and have instilled a new interest in pro-environmental behavior. This paper proposes a different argument. We claim that stricter restrictions are less publicly appealing than previously argued; for environmental purposes, they make people less inclined to agree on adopting more environmental behaviors at the individual level. Meanwhile, they increase willingness to see governments taking a stronger line on environmental policy. To test our argument, we propose an analysis of attitudes towards environmental action at the individual and government level in Italy, France and the UK – three large European countries with similar subnational units of COVID management. Leveraging variation of lockdown `tiers’ and geolocated survey datasets, we show that harder forms of lockdown have (a) diffused environmental action concerns to higher governmental levels and (b) decreased willingness to individually invest in pro-environmental behavior. The evidence refocuses the implications of the pandemic for other distributive public policy realms, and highlights difficulties that COVID has imposed for environmental governance.

Experiment 2 primes respondents on the nature of the societal change (pandemic, climate change, generic challenges) and elicits their preferences for input- and output-oriented decision-making procedures (referenda, partisan consensus, and parliamentary support vs. international coordination, quick executive action, and expertise) with a best-worst scaling approach.Initial results indicate that citizens in all six countries tend to care more about restrictions of their private life than about restrictions of their core democratic liberties. This is mirrored by majority preferences for expert- and executive-led decision-making in tackling diverse current challenges. Comparative and sub-group analyses will uncover to what extent these patterns differ across the six political systems and whether citizens’ variation in political and societal trust or their direct affectedness explain diverging preferences for the conduct of democratic decision-making.

Overall, we find that citizens prefer policy instruments which apply to medium- and large-sized companies, support stringent reporting requirements and strong sanctioning provisions. Moreover, support for regulation is partly driven by protectionist motives and by demands for consumer protection.We contribute to a growing literature in the political sciences that examines which types of policy approaches (voluntary/bottom-up vs governmental/top-down) garner public support.

However, we know little about the impact these restrictions on policy views, especially preferences for policies with similar public good problems such as the environment. We tackle these questions by focusing on the effect of recent pandemic regulations on environmental attitudes in Europe, where the management of COVID infections has varied across and within countries. Recent literature argues that lockdowns have nudged citizens to care more about the environment and have instilled a new interest in pro-environmental behavior. This paper proposes a different argument. We claim that stricter restrictions are less publicly appealing than previously argued; for environmental purposes, they make people less inclined to agree on adopting more environmental behaviors at the individual level. Meanwhile, they increase willingness to see governments taking a stronger line on environmental policy. To test our argument, we propose an analysis of attitudes towards environmental action at the individual and government level in Italy, France and the UK – three large European countries with similar subnational units of COVID management. Leveraging variation of lockdown `tiers’ and geolocated survey datasets, we show that harder forms of lockdown have (a) diffused environmental action concerns to higher governmental levels and (b) decreased willingness to individually invest in pro-environmental behavior. The evidence refocuses the implications of the pandemic for other distributive public policy realms, and highlights difficulties that COVID has imposed for environmental governance.

We estimate such doubts cause 3-5% of Singaporean voters to support the dominant party despite a preference for the opposition. We also examine individual-level correlates of doubting ballot secrecy: a tendency towards belief in conspiracies and distrust of the mass media are the strongest predictors. Finally, we use counterfactual election results to show the consequences of these doubts: they consistently secure the dominant party additional parliamentary seats, thereby buttressing dominant party rule over the long term without resorting to overtly repressive measures that can attract domestic and international condemnation.

Content and Affect in Election Observation Reports	45	What do international election observation missions think (and feel) about the elections they observe? An election observation report represents a written judgment by one group regarding a given election. While elections are fundamentally a technical process, the normative salience of democratic processes and the partisan nature of politics means that the content of election observation reports may reflect the normative or political priorities of the observers drafting the report. This project examines how the content and normative/emotional affect contained in election observation reports varies as a function of regional, observer-specific, and election-specific characteristics. Using quantitative text analysis, we find significant variation in the topic content, normative stance, and affective stance election observation reports from over 1000 elections over the past 30 years. More specifically, we find that the language used to describe elections in Africa is more negative than language used to describe elections elsewhere: we expect that observers more frequently emphasize the risk of electoral fraud, even when fundamental electoral characteristics (e.g., pre-election violence) are similar. Our results shed new light on the role of international electoral observation missions in ensuring the quality of elections in developing democracies.	Comparative Politics

The Politics of Absentee voting	1029	In the age of COVID, the ability of voters to resort to absentee voting has come to the forefront of the minds of politicians and voters alike. However, this question is as old as democracy itself. With the extension of suffrage, the right to vote by mail would follow from the need to give all citizens the right to vote, even those that were unable to do so at the voting day with a ballot in hand. Voters in various occupations could be restricted from being in the country, to take time off, long-travel distances or sick. However, concerns of voter fraud and abuse were raised by opponents of absentee voting. This raised the question of to what extent should the state ease voter’s ability to participate in the political process by allowing for absentee voting? Even if this might go against the demand of voting secrecy or even increase the likelihood of electoral malfeasance. We first argue that this concern becomes politized with the extension of the vote to the lower classes. Parties and politician split in opposition or support of absentee voting depending on the likelihood to which they benefited from the system of absentee voting. We then then use extensive Roll-Call Vote data on postal voting in Norway between 1880 to 1930s to ascertain the incentives of politicians to restrict or grant absentee voting rights and curtail said rights for various groups.

Relying on data from a new survey with a sample of about 17,000 respondents fielded online between 2020 and 2021, the paper performs principal component analysis (PCA), latent class analysis (LCA), as well as logistic regression analysis to estimate the assignment of respondents to either a technocratic, populist or party-democratic class based on education, trust, left−right among other factors. The analysis aims at finding out if the dimensions of expertise, anti-politics and elitism that structure technocratic attitudes, their partial overlap with populist attitudes, and the size of citizens’ classes holding such attitudes, are valid also in radically different cultural, socio-economic and regime contexts. Ultimately, the question the paper poses concerns the validity of fundamental political attitudes toward representation cutting across global regions or, conversely, their variation across global territorial cleavages. MDSD provides the possibility to identify either common factors accounting for the presence of similar sets of attitudes worldwide or sources of variation between regions.	Comparative Politics

The costs of ruling are quite severe in CEECs and the literature points to the effect of economy and corruption (Roberts 2008; Jastramskis 2020). Yet the existing retrospective economic voting literature focuses on how the economic conditions affect the support for the last cabinet before the election. This approach is reasonable in stable systems of advanced democracies; however, it seems static in the systems with frequent cabinet reshuffles like in CEECs. Moreover, political situation in CEE countries often results in a caretaker cabinet with non-partisan ministers. In addition to that, political parties in CEE are very unstable and often go through the processes of fission and fusion in almost every electoral term (Ibenskas 2016). In effect, cabinets in CEECs are more unstable and the instability of parties and cabinets leads to blurring the clarity of responsibility. We use aggregate-level data for 11 CEE countries since 1990 to analyze economic voting in relation to this blurring of responsibility. To do so, we combine the electoral results data with detailed information about party restructuring. Overall, our research points to the effect of party organization changes and cabinet reshuffles on the level of retrospective economic voting.	Comparative Politics

But while economic explanations for this disaffection are theoretically clear and quantifiable, explanations centered on cultural factors are more vague and harder to evaluate empirically. We address this problem by distinguishing theoretically between five different “storylines'' about the cultural origins of populism: (1) an inter-generational backlash among older people who feel that traditional values have been overtaken by a post-materialist culture; (2) white natives who feel ethno-cultural estrangement, fearing the demographic and cultural implications of immigration; (3) resentment among rural residents who feel looked down upon by urban elites (4) white men anxious about their declining social status; and (5) people who feel isolated and alienated from their communities. Using extensive data from Europe and the United State, we empirically assess the potential usefulness of each explanation in accounting for the populist vote. Our analysis indicates that concerns about ethno-cultural change induced by immigration is central to understanding the populist vote; so, but to a lesser extent, is rural resentment. In contrast, explanations centered on communal disintegration, declining social status or an intergenerational values divide are pertinent in only specific cases. The analysis helps disentangle the cultural forces associated with the rise of populism and highlights the heterogeneous coalitions that form the populist base across different countries.

Existing research has focused on the mobilizing role of criticism by a small sub-set of Western international election observation missions (EOMs). Yet, contemporary international election observation is a complex regime populated by a panoply of organizations from different regions, with different sponsors and sharply varying professionalism. Many countries now host multiple EOMs which may disagree in their verdicts about election quality. What does this mean for post-election mobilization and violence? We theorize two alternative possibilities about the effect of multiple EOMs on post-election violence, based on an expanded view of which EOMs may influence local actors' beliefs. First, drawing insight from the theory of motivated reasoning---whereby partisans are swayed by information that supports their side---it may be that countervailing verdicts from different EOMs serves to foment and exacerbate two-sided violence. Alternatively, if citizens attach weight to the verdicts of multiple groups, we should expect that countervailing verdicts will increase uncertainty about electoral quality and dampen post-election violence. We explore these hypotheses using new, detailed data on EOM verdicts that covers a large number of Western- and non-Western observer groups, combined with fine-grained data on election violence and its perpetrators. We employ multiple methods to guard against the endogeneity of election observation, and implement a sub-national test to explore implications of our argument.	International Relations and Conflict

Existing research aiming to explain this variation highlights institutional and societal differences between contexts, but is mostly forced to rely on short time series and cross-national comparisons. Using an original dataset compiled from historical newspaper and parliamentary committee reports on election-related violent events for all 20 general elections in England and Wales between 1832-1914, we investigate the strength and variation of the relationship between electoral competitiveness and violence. Exploiting ex- tensive temporal and within-country variation, we find that competitiveness was strongly, robustly, and positively associated with more candidate-driven, strategic forms of election violence initially, but that this relationship breaks down in the late 19th-century, where the number of violent events drastically declined while electoral competitiveness remained high. Investigating the causes for this decline, we rule out several mechanisms commonly associated with a decline in election violence and thereby narrow down the set of institutional changes that could account for the decoupling of electoral competitiveness and violence. Our findings contribute to debates within the electoral violence and 19th-century British political development literatures, as well as the burgeoning literature on election-violence prevention strategies.

By exposing large masses to common messages, modern media can increase the political salience of group traits and favor collective action along ethnic lines. I study the case of the Basque Country during the late Franco regime and the Spanish democratic transition (1960-1979), where local radio stations operated by pro-nationalist Basque clergy promoted the transmission of regional language and folklore and participation in local civic associations. Using terrain irregularities to isolate random variation in radio signal quality, and a variety of contemporary and archival data on radio programs, political behavior, language use, and victimization in the Spanish civil war, I find that exposure to these ethnic media increased support for new, radical independentist parties tied to ETA. The effect is concentrated in municipalities with lower historical support for Basque nationalism, smaller linguistic group, and a past of Francoist repression. Media can be identity catalysts in communities threatened by cultural assimilation, especially if state violence sustains an ethnic cleavage.	Comparative Politics

We find that the establishment of professionalized police forces reduced pre-election violence, especially large-scale riots and disturbances. Moreover, once a constabulary has been formed more and better-paid police forces further reduce the number of recorded incidents.	Comparative Politics

Departing from the conventional wisdom, we argue that elites use violence not only for its deterrent but also for its mobilizing effects. Our paper establishes two instrumental logics: First, violence is used to scare non-supporters and deter them from voting, as current work implies. Second, violence is also employed to polarize the electorate and increase support for politicians complicit with or responsible for the violence. We argue that the two instrumental logics vary in terms of actors, geographical targeting, cleavages of contention, and empirical implications for non-violence outcomes. We expect that violence for demobilization is used by incumbents to deter non-supporters in opposition strongholds, results in lower electoral turnout, and is carried out along partisan lines. In contrast, we argue that violence for polarization is used by challenger parties to mobilize new supporters. We expect such violence in electorally competitive areas, that violence results in higher electoral turnout for the challenger, and that it exploits non-partisan cleavages, such as social, cultural, or religious divisions.

Citizen interest groups representing marginalised stakeholders such as asylum seekers lack the resources to gain political access and must rely on institutional arrangements to improve their strategic options. How do institutional arrangements affect the lobbying strategies of minority interest groups? Understanding the answer will improve the inclusion of minority groups in democratic policymaking. Consensus institutions and corporatist interest group systems should increase the quantity and quality of lobbying opportunities. However, asylum rights groups may mobilise public support to improve their political leverage in more responsive majoritarian institutions, while deregulated pluralist interest group systems may facilitate the use of informal lobbying channels.Through analysis of 38 semi-structured interviews with asylum rights groups in Germany and the UK, I create a most similar comparative case study to argue that the quantity of opportunities created by Germany's consensus-corporatist system do not enable direct lobbying by minority groups any more than in the UK's majoritarian-pluralist system. However, the openness and collaborative norms created by Germany's corporatist interest group systems do improve the quality of working relationship between asylum rights groups and policymakers. This provides German asylum rights groups with high level access to lobby both their opponents and their allies, while UK groups remain excluded. This study therefore demonstrates the importance of institutionalised norms and identifies the mechanisms by which they can improve minority representation.	Comparative Politics

But why do these voters endorse such an alternative, non-pluralist form of representation? To better understand the political causes of this phenomenon, this study empirically explores the ideological profile(s) of this latent class of citizens. Using novel data from an original public opinion survey across seven European countries, Australia, and the United States, we explore whether this group’s ideological distribution is centrist, skewed, or heterogenous, both on the general left-right dimension and on ten issue-specific items. By identifying the ideological characteristics of this ‘technocratic class’, and the degree to which they are distinct from party-democratic and populist voters, we can unpack their political attitudes and motivations. In a time of unprecedented crises and ongoing challenges to democratic representation, this paper has important implications for our understanding of the appeal of alternative, non-programmatic forms of government.

Voters not only reject candidates (and citizens) with undemocratic attitudes, but also refuse to trade off democratic norms by proximity in the ideological and territorial dimensions.

The losing party hopes that the new issue so polarizes the electorate that it produces clearer party choices, stimulates participation, and draws new voters. This paper examines the use of misinformation for polarizing the electorate on a new radical issue dimension. While political elites routinely employ misinformation to polarize voters, its strategic purpose and its micro-level implications for voters remain poorly understood. We draw on an experiment embedded in a representative survey conducted after West Bengal’s 2021 elections. In West Bengal, the opposition party sought to polarize voters on the government’s role in matters of religion. On this issue, a super-majority of voters preferred secular government. The opposition spread false news alleging government favoritism towards religious out-groups; hoping to polarize the electorate into two groups, those wanting a secular government (continuing to support the incumbent) and those wanting a majoritarian government (and therefore switching support to the opposition). Empirically, we find that the misinformation strategy failed, for three reasons. First, latent demand for the radical policy was very low. Second, the issue reinforced instead of cutting across existing partisan cleavages. Third, relatedly, because misinformation reinforced partisan priors, existing supporters of the opposition party were most likely believe it. Thus, instead of polarizing the larger electorate and gaining new voters, the new entrant polarized their own voters.	Comparative Politics

Focusing on one-party regimes, I expect party survival to be determined by its membership base stability. I exploit two variables available in OPAMED, party penetration in society and party membership stability, to test the hypothesis. Counterintuitively to previous research, I find that party breadth does not influence survival. However, I present strong evidence that membership stability over time significantly predicts ruling party survival. Ruling parties with decreasing membership within the last decade of government have higher chances of failure than those with stable membership. Among the reasons for ruling party demise there are citizens’ disenfranchisement, party organization jamming, and unrepairable external shocks. Further tests show that models predicting party failure without using membership stability hinder validity and increase model imprecision. The paper concludes that membership stability is key predictor for party survival.	Political Institutions

In this paper, I analyze a natural experiment from Mexico, in which a political party used a lottery system to select candidates for national public office, and present new insights into how access to elected office shapes the development of new parties. I find that the party was able to build local party networks by gaining access to office (through elected legislators) that subsequently mobilized new voters for the party. I show that the party was able to institutionalize more successfully and increase its membership base in localities that randomly received access to public office through an elected legislator from the same locality. The findings highlight the importance of access to state resources for the success of new parties and have important implications for debates about democratic representation and accountability.

They establish who benefits from the fruits of their labor on agricultural land, who has incentives to invest in entrepreneurial projects, and who has the right to residency and inclusion in a community. Scholars have long described cases in which women—and men—face weakened property rights as a result of local land institutions. Yet, both across and within communities, there is wide variation in the actual practices of gendered land rights.This paper examines when and why gendered land institutions diverge from their historical social institutions in two Southern African countries: Malawi and Zambia. Governments in both countries, prompted by domestic and international civil society, have implemented laws that promise equal land rights to men and women. They have, thus, attempted to change gendered land institutions within their countries. In some cases, actual practice matches the de jure law, while in other cases, historically rooted institutional rules at odds with the law prevail. We examine the gap between the institutional rules and actual practices for two types of property rights: the powers to inherit and to manage land. We show how the variation in the state’s reach influences the likelihood of institutional change. This research addresses broader questions of heterogeneity and change within the social institutions that structure individual behavior, as well as the role that law and practice play in securing property rights for women in Africa.

However, this literature is arguably flawed for two reasons. First, it assumes the equitable provision of public goods within the President’s ethnic group, which neglects both the potential of intra-ethnic inequality in public goods provision as well as the existence of non-material or ‘psychic’ benefits. Second, the literature is empirically narrow inasmuch as the vast majority of studies either focus on individual countries, a very narrow range of outcomes, and/or use a single data source. As such we conduct the largest examination to date of ethno-regional favouritism in Sub-Saharan Africa using a wide variety of survey and infrastructure data across more than two dozen countries and a large number of outcomes. Strikingly, we fail to find any evidence of a positive effect of co-ethnicity, and in fact find a negative effect across multiple objective outcomes. Moreover, we find evidence that is consistent with the existence of the subjective ‘psychic’ benefits of co-ethnicity, such that individuals in co-ethnic areas have higher opinions of the government, view themselves as subjectively better off and rate government performance on service delivery higher, even after controlling for the services in question. Finally, we show that individual-level co-ethnicity is associated with increasing intra-ethnic inequality, such that co-ethnicity is associated with increasing poverty and wealth simultaneously. We supplement our results with qualitative case study evidence from South Africa and Nigeria.	Comparative Politics

The experiment randomized candidate attributes, including ethnicity, asking a series of questions that tap into the voters’ expectations of distributional favoritism, quality, and accessibility. Layered on the core experiment was a second randomization involving informational treatments about the MP's record aimed at unpacking types of information ethnicity signals. We find that voters strongly prefer co-ethnic candidates, but the reasons they do so go far beyond expectations of distributional favoritism. Voters also see co-ethnic candidates as more competent, moral, and accessible, although they do not seem to believe that accessibility translates into greater ability to sanction or hold candidates accountable.

They establish who benefits from the fruits of their labor on agricultural land, who has incentives to invest in entrepreneurial projects, and who has the right to residency and inclusion in a community. Scholars have long described cases in which women—and men—face weakened property rights as a result of local land institutions. Yet, both across and within communities, there is wide variation in the actual practices of gendered land rights.This paper examines when and why gendered land institutions diverge from their historical social institutions in two Southern African countries: Malawi and Zambia. Governments in both countries, prompted by domestic and international civil society, have implemented laws that promise equal land rights to men and women. They have, thus, attempted to change gendered land institutions within their countries. In some cases, actual practice matches the de jure law, while in other cases, historically rooted institutional rules at odds with the law prevail. We examine the gap between the institutional rules and actual practices for two types of property rights: the powers to inherit and to manage land. We show how the variation in the state’s reach influences the likelihood of institutional change. This research addresses broader questions of heterogeneity and change within the social institutions that structure individual behavior, as well as the role that law and practice play in securing property rights for women in Africa.

However, this literature is arguably flawed for two reasons. First, it assumes the equitable provision of public goods within the President’s ethnic group, which neglects both the potential of intra-ethnic inequality in public goods provision as well as the existence of non-material or ‘psychic’ benefits. Second, the literature is empirically narrow inasmuch as the vast majority of studies either focus on individual countries, a very narrow range of outcomes, and/or use a single data source. As such we conduct the largest examination to date of ethno-regional favouritism in Sub-Saharan Africa using a wide variety of survey and infrastructure data across more than two dozen countries and a large number of outcomes. Strikingly, we fail to find any evidence of a positive effect of co-ethnicity, and in fact find a negative effect across multiple objective outcomes. Moreover, we find evidence that is consistent with the existence of the subjective ‘psychic’ benefits of co-ethnicity, such that individuals in co-ethnic areas have higher opinions of the government, view themselves as subjectively better off and rate government performance on service delivery higher, even after controlling for the services in question. Finally, we show that individual-level co-ethnicity is associated with increasing intra-ethnic inequality, such that co-ethnicity is associated with increasing poverty and wealth simultaneously. We supplement our results with qualitative case study evidence from South Africa and Nigeria.	Comparative Politics

Typical accounts of World War I articulate a historical narrative defined by the various declarations of war and treaties of surrender between the various members of the Entente and Central Powers. Removed from these narratives though, are substantive engagement with Turkish experiences and agency. Interpreting war from the tradition of critical war studies and postcolonialism, I offer an alternative reading of World War I that focuses on the Turkish experience of war during the later stages of World War I and beyond. This article shows that World War I persisted beyond the official treaties that mark its “end,” and that traditional accounts of World War I preserve Orientalist power dynamics and identities which continue to frame the former Entente’s relationship with Turkey and the domestic relations between the Turkish state and Turkish citizens. By illuminating the Turkish experience of war, this article seeks to disrupt traditional international relations’ uncritical fascination with the “Great Powers’” perspective and explore its complicity in the destruction of agency and voices from the Global South. This article contributes to the historiography of World War I, global international relations, and theories of war termination.	International Relations and Conflict

Most studies are focused on the long-term eﬀects of individual or family victimization. In this paper, we examine the legacy of violence that selectively targets community elites. Inspired by theoretical literature on identity formation and transmission we hypothesize that elites play an important independent role in shaping political values and beliefs. To empirically test this argument we study the aftereﬀects of Nazi-era repression of Catholic parish priests in Germany’s Bavaria. We construct a dataset of priest repression and, hypothesizing that especially activist priests were ones that had been targeted by state authorities, ask whether repression of activist priests in the 1930s is associated with higher vote for the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavaria’s Catholic party, in post-war elections. We ﬁnd a strong and persistent association between Nazi-era repression of Catholic clergy and post-war vote for the CSU. Nazi repression signaled the quality of activist priests who forged beliefs consistent with political Catholicism and also catalyzed priest activism by juxtaposing authoritarian Nazi ideology against the Catholic value-system. Our ﬁndings suggest that violence shapes political behavior via mechanisms other than only direct victimization.	Comparative Politics

Shiraef	University of Notre Dame	p	y	0289	The Impact of Communist-era Multiethnic Identity Engineering on Post-communist Political Identity Transmission: A Natural Experiment at the Albania-Greece Border	101	Does the ethnic designation applied by an authoritarian regime to minority populations explain variation in identity transmission over time? A common assumption about authoritarian regimes is that they are unilaterally intolerant of diversity; however, some of the world’s most brutal dictators implemented real protections for some minority groups. For instance, the Albanian communist leader, Enver Hoxha, built group rights into the Albanian constitution (1945) and then, had published at point of death a 450-page tribute to his protections for the Greek minority. The tribute is propagandistic, but also demarcates an actual difference in policy toward a specific group of people, who he deemed territorially as “the Greek minority.” Hoxha’s minority identity engineering policy was carried out between 1945-1985, and lightened in its enforcement after Hoxha’s death, but still, is in the constitution and in many ways, reproduced today. The puzzle behind my motivation for this project is: how does one forge a political identity in a post-communist setting after your family has been told their ethnopolitical identity by the state for 50+ years? With the vantage points of (1) historical information for a baseline and (2) people who survived the policy, across state-designated ethnic groups, my paper poses a natural experiment design to uncover the longer-term impacts of the identity engineering on identity transmission approaches taken by the impacted populations. I hypothesize that the Greek minority identity in Albania is predominantly an ethnic feature of communist-era Albania which continues to be transmitted politically alongside leftist ideologies in post-communist Albania.

A substantial body of scholarship examines the political consequences of clientelism in developing countries. Yet, the broader economic consequences of clientelism remain unclear. We argue that despite voting for politicians who offer targeted goods, citizens abstain from financial transactions with these politicians in the future. Clientelistic politicians, by demonstrating their willingness to bend rules in the electoral process, lead consumers to believe they will also be untrustworthy in a transactional environment. We test this theory using evidence from a conjoint experiment in Morocco, a country where politicians often have one foot in the private sector. The results demonstrate the linkages between patronage networks and consumer behavior in contexts characterized by clientelism and suggest that political support does not translate to economic support.

A Reassessment of Theory and Evidence	808	Independent election commissions typically seek to ensure voters have easy access to the polls. One approach to this is polling station proliferation: creating new polling stations to ensure that voters do not have to travel too far to vote, and that when they arrive their wait is not too long. Multiple recent studies in political science argue that one effect of polling station proliferation is to increase electoral clientelism and corruption, through either vote buying or turnout buying. In this paper, we reassess the theory and evidence behind these claims. We first demonstrate that the evidence for a causal effect of polling station proliferation on vote buying is weak. We then argue that the evidence for turnout buying is consistent with a simpler explanation. Voters respond to lower travel and wait times by being more likely to vote; underlying distributions of partisanship in the population explain heterogeneous effects for different parties.

Yet, research has shown that, much like Western Europe, the underlying structure of party competition is surprisingly stable and organized along an economic and a cultural dimension. This raises the question whether our theories of party position change (or stability) in established party systems can help explain the positional shifts of parties in more unstable settings as well. We argue that the high risk of party death and the large number of (new) competitors increase the incentives for political parties to change their positions, even on their most salient dimension. However, parties differ with regard to the perceived risk of such shifts. Particularly young parties, which are not strongly rooted in society, and parties that rely on clientelist party-voter linkages, can more easily adjust their positions. To test these claims, we compile a data set that combines expert survey estimates of party positions with party manifesto data for the period 2002-2019. The analysis confirms our expectations. This study thus shows that the nature of party-voter linkages is crucial to understand party position change in a context of high electoral volatility.	Comparative Politics

Evidence from the post-communist space	54	Direct public funding (DPF) of political parties is expected to undermine their propensity to engage in illicit funding. This expectation rests on the assumption that DPF will alleviate the fundraising burden and weaken party-donor linkages regarded as a source of corruption. Despite this assumption, empirical evidence points to the heterogeneous effects of DPF on the integrity of the political process. Yet existing research on party funding/DPF-corruption linkage suffers from a critical shortcoming. It relies exclusively on the regulatory scope of the political financing regime (PFR), typified by aggregate indexes, dichotomous indicators, or other proxy measures that fail to account for the cross-national and within-country variation in DPF.This pioneering study overcomes this limitation by using actual data on DPF as an explanatory variable to investigate whether a higher DPF level reduces political corruption. To test this argument, it uses panel data models and an original dataset on the DPF level across 27 post-communist regimes between 1990-2020. The results of fixed-effects and random-effects within-between estimations point to a differential effect of DPF on corruption. On average, those post-communist regimes that provided more generous state support to political parties at the outset of transition recorded lower corruption levels, but this negative effect diminishes over time. Thus, considering corruption resilience, more generous state support of political parties during early democratisation might have entailed long-term positive benefits by affecting the initial corruption level.

The use of Social Media by opposition groups in the recent wave of unrest in the Middle East was touted as a solution to the mobilization problem in authoritarian regimes. While non-democratic regimes, in the beginning, relied on less effective passive techniques, such as blocking the Internet, to limit the positive effects of Social Media on mass mobilization, they later adopted more proactive approaches, such as fabricating news and manipulating online data, to increase their stability. These cyber-oppressive strategies, despite their recent popularity among repressive states, have remained understudied in the literature. This paper argues that since repressing nonviolent dissent is more costly than violent ones, oppressive states prefer their oppositions resort to violence. They, therefore, not only do not limit the Social Media accounts of pro-violent dissidents but also support and promote this discourse. Instead, the primary focus of pro-government Social Media accounts is on targeting and defusing users who support and encourage civil resistance. I evaluate these theoretical arguments using a dataset of more than 5 million tweets by Iranian government-backed accounts, which are identified and flagged by Twitter’s Integrity Project.

Shocking displays of PMCs, such as a series of murders of politicians across Europe, showcase that crime is no longer a fringe phenomenon in democratic politics. Yet little is known about their potentially destabilizing effects.This paper investigates if rising levels of political crime polarize public opinion and influence voting behavior. More specifically, the project relies on novel event-level data on PMCs that originate from official German police records. In the context of German local elections, I use a difference-in-differences design to analyze how incidents of crime impact voter turnout and influence electoral polarization at the ballot. My analysis also underpins that differentiating among varying types of crime is crucial to expose their differential effects on voter behavior. Overall, my study contributes to an emerging literature on the consequences of political crime in Western democracies.	Behaviour and Opinion

Evidence from the Kingdom of Hungary (1848-1945)	736	This paper provides the analytical narrative for why there are and always have been very few non-Magyar ethno-nationalist parties in the Hungarian Diet (1867-1920). The pathway of Offensive Nationalism under which voters in Hungary were (dis)enfranchised between 1848 and 1920 did not necessarily inhibit the formation of ethno-nationalist parties outside of parliament, in fact it encouraged ethno-national minorities to organize into factions to fight for their right to participation and greater political autonomy. However, only the poorest and worst organized of these ethno-national minorities were enfranchised in 1874, 1899 and, 1913. This decision by incumbent Liberal Magyar elites increased their own electoral wins in subsequent elections, particularly in districts where enfranchised minorities formed a majority of the population. Meanwhile, ethno-nationalist parties of the better organized ethno-national minorities, and that challenged the ethno-nationalist order of the Kingdom of Hungary remained extra-parliamentary. Evidence presented comes from months of archival fieldwork in State archives in Vienna and Budapest which yielded the digitization of census, electoral, legislative and, party records.This paper is part of my book-style dissertation project which looks at how enfranchisement affected the development of party systems in the constituent states of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.

What use are authoritarian efforts to monitor potentially-explosive simmering social restiveness? The threat of mass public protest looms large for all authoritarian regimes, as solving the problem of authoritarian control (Svolik 2012) and preventing the spiral of an informational cascade are crucial for authoritarian survival (Kuran 1991). At the individual level, when people observe protest taking place locally, this may shift their perceptions of the ruling regime and, ultimately, may push them over the threshold at which their grievances turn into active contention. In this paper, I examine the effects of being exposed to public displays of discontent on attitudes towards the authorities and on subsequent willingness to engage in protest. I compile a dataset of over 1.4 million public opinion survey responses on protest sentiment and regime satisfaction in Putin-era Russia from 2007-2019 and combine this with databases of on-the-ground protest across the country. Together with difference-in-differences and event study designs, this allows me to identify the effects of protest on public opinion in a prominent authoritarian regime. I find that while observing protest depresses approval of local regime representatives in particular, evidence for broader effects on authoritarian support or on wholesale spirals of defection is weaker.

Drawing on detailed data on the social categories and organizational bases of participants in these mobilization movements we investigate implications of theories pertaining to the social foundations of anti-democratic movements. We also revisit existing findings about the drivers of mass protest, showing that the factors triggering pro-democracy movements are not necessarily the same as those triggering mass mobilisation motivated by authoritarian sentiments.

Cognitive Mapping of the Dichotomy in Elites’ Use of Threat	935	For centuries, elites have used religious identity as a means of establishing or increasing political power. However, if the regime that preceded the coming to power of new elites was one characterized by norms of religious tolerance, then those new elites will need to justify their use of religious identity in terms of threats posed by earlier-tolerated minority religious groups. Conversely, if counter-elites propose to increase religious tolerance, then adherents of the status quo will need to argue against those changes by framing certain majority religious groups as being threatened. This hypothesized asymmetry in the use of threat – between a focus on threatening minority religious groups in a context of moves away from tolerance, and a focus on threatened majority religious groups in a context of moves toward tolerance – is explored in this paper. Specifically, taking a computer-assisted Cognitive Mapping Approach (CMA), I construct cognitive maps of selected parliamentary debates from Ireland and India, tracing the cognitive processes involved in the proponents of religious intolerance in both sets of cases, and demonstrate the differential use of threat.

However, other studies also suggest that party-based dictatorships also collapse through elite divisions which are generated through government policy choices, political appointments, and decisions on rent distribution. This article attempts to identify the conditions under which elite divisions lead to regime change in party-based dictatorships. Specifically, we show that whether elite divisions lead to regime collapse depends upon the historical origins of ruling parties. Using the V-Party dataset, we show that elite divisions within the ruling party decrease the levels of democratization as well as the risk of authoritarian breakdown, when ruling parties originate from ideology-based conflicts. Our findings suggest that dictators can use strong partisan ties to maintain elite cohesion among loyalists and legitimize the use of repressive measures to deal with defectors even if elite divisions occur. Consequently, elite divisions fail to credibly challenge the government and make it difficult for opposition figures and activists to rally against the extant regime effectively.	Comparative Politics

Education and Elite support for Universal suffrage	1025	We develop and test implications of the argument that education promotes democratization, by focusing on elites’ university education, and how that influences their role in supporting and actively promoting the introduction of universal suffrage. We examine this with evidence from the suffrage extensions in Norway during the late 19th and early 20th century, drawing on novel data on Norwegian MP’s educational background and revealed preferences for universal suffrage. We argue that higher education, especially when it is secular and exposes students to enlightenment ideas and critical thinking, is likely to foster commitments to equality and universal rights. This in turn nurtures support for equality of voting rights for all classes and genders. We should therefore expect MPs with higher education to be supporters of democratization and the equality of rights, and especially so for those with secular university-education (as opposed to, e.g. education from professional schools).We test our expectations drawing on data from 68 constitutional proposals for universal suffrage and 29 Roll-Call Votes for the same in Norway, from 1883 to the adoption gender neutral universal suffrage in 1913. Our results indicate that university education among MPs is associated with proposing or voting for universal suffrage reforms. These results are robust to accounting for rollcall fixed effects, profession, socialization environment, fathers’ class, party-identification. This is consistent with the argument that educated MPs revealed preferences for universal suffrage are driven by ideological preferences rather than material incentives.	Comparative Politics

While existing social science research emphasizes the importance of social networks for collective action, there is a dearth of studies that systematically analyze the impact of personal networks on individual-level political outcomes across countries. Leveraging original data on the pre-independence political elite of 24 African countries, collected through a semi-automated coding of encyclopedic sources, my paper analyzes the effect of individual elites’ integration in their countries’ pre-independence political networks on two key post-independence outcomes: government inclusion and political persecution. My data include over 1,000 elite individuals who were politically active before independence, with detailed information on their political careers during colonial rule and after independence. In terms of individuals’ network integration, I distinguish between their network centrality and the ethnic diversity of their connections. Drawing on theories of social capital in multiethnic societies, I argue that network centrality is key to explain individuals’ inclusion in government. However, when it comes to political persecution, the ethnic diversity of networks is more relevant. Individuals with more diverse personal networks enjoy higher protection against persecution, such as imprisonment or assassination. The empirical results largely support my argument. Controlling for individuals’ career during colonial rule and their geographic origin, I find that i) more centrally positioned individuals were more likely to become included in government after independence, and ii) the higher individuals’ share of trans-ethnic connections in the pre-independence network, the lower their risk of suffering political persecution after independence.

Moreover, scholars have documented examples of authoritarian elites reappearing and becoming established in new democracies long after the autocratic regime has collapsed. While there are theoretical arguments on the conditions under which elites are likely to survive democratization, we still lack systematic evidence for when this happens and a valid measure that captures their comeback in democracies. Against this background, this paper develops a theory of autocratic revolving doors - authoritarian elites leveraging their political connections, experience and skills to obtain political or economic prominence in new democracies – into a consistent and testable set of empirical implications. These are tested using a novel measure of autocratic elite comeback in politics with data on all autocratic cabinet members between 1963 and 2015. The results indicate that elites with a more prestigious portfolio (i.e. economy, internal affairs, budget) and former leaders are more likely to gain cabinet positions in democracy, while military leaders and members with less important positions (i.e. ambassador or adviser) are less likely to reappear in democratic politics. The results also show heterogeneous pathways of return that are systematically influenced by the characteristics of the position held by elites.	Comparative Politics

It assumes that democratic consolidation is determined by perceptional and behavioral acceptance of democratic rule, and delves into the power relationship between main political players of the transition game and their political strategies and circumstances: 1) political parties-authoritarian ruling parties and pro-democratic opposition parties, 2) authoritarian rulers-military and civilian, and 3) prodemocratic opposition parties, civil society, and international facilitators, like U.S. and the UN.

Much of recent work has focused on attitudes toward admission policies or support for welfare for immigrants. Most of these studies examine such preferences in European countries and the United States. In this paper, we expand the existing literature in two ways. First, we explore preferences in Latin America, focusing on Brazil, the largest country in the region, and where the influx of immigrants is growing. We compare Brazil to the United States. Immigration has become a pressing issue in Latin America, as the flow of people to countries outside the region has reduced since the 2000s while immigration within the region has increased. Escalating violence and political and economic instability in countries like Venezuela have forced people to be displaced to neighboring countries, triggering diverse responses from governments and citizens alike. Second, we investigate attitudes toward the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Who supports deportation? Which interventions can contrast negative attitudes? We combine analysis of existing survey data with original experiments to explore how the socio-economic and political context in which individuals live and the immigration policies adopted by governments affect attitudes. Moreover, we examine how natives of the receiving country develop preferences on deportation depending on various factors such as the part of the country where they live as well as the origin of immigrants.

Popular votes thus represent a hurdle to the widening of the demos and merit study as a distinct enfranchisement path. A key question for this path is under what conditions the electorate is willing to extend the right to vote to a new demographic. Existing explanations are based on structural conditions, overlooking the extent to which cognitive biases—especially the compromise effect—impact popular support for enfranchisement. To make this argument, I focus on one of the most hotly debated forms of contemporary enfranchisement: voting rights for immigrants. Through observational data from 31 referendums in Switzerland and a survey experiment fielded in the United States, I show that support for an enfranchisement proposal is higher when voters are simultaneously presented with an even more liberal version. I complement these findings with case study evidence revealing that not only scholars but also parties have overlooked this. Instead of leveraging simultaneous referendums, pro-enfranchisement parties often try to avoid presenting voters with more than one question, unknowingly reducing their chances of success. The implications of these findings go beyond enfranchisement and call on scholars to consider the compromise effect in the study of multi-option referendums more generally.	Comparative Politics

Much of recent work has focused on attitudes toward admission policies or support for welfare for immigrants. Most of these studies examine such preferences in European countries and the United States. In this paper, we expand the existing literature in two ways. First, we explore preferences in Latin America, focusing on Brazil, the largest country in the region, and where the influx of immigrants is growing. We compare Brazil to the United States. Immigration has become a pressing issue in Latin America, as the flow of people to countries outside the region has reduced since the 2000s while immigration within the region has increased. Escalating violence and political and economic instability in countries like Venezuela have forced people to be displaced to neighboring countries, triggering diverse responses from governments and citizens alike. Second, we investigate attitudes toward the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Who supports deportation? Which interventions can contrast negative attitudes? We combine analysis of existing survey data with original experiments to explore how the socio-economic and political context in which individuals live and the immigration policies adopted by governments affect attitudes. Moreover, we examine how natives of the receiving country develop preferences on deportation depending on various factors such as the part of the country where they live as well as the origin of immigrants.

Dictators frequently purge elites to alleviate threats to their rule from coups d’état. However, dictators often deploy an alternative rarely-studied type of elite purge, which aims to help dictators survive by mitigating threats from the people and foreign states. Specifically, dictators can scapegoat elites to engage in blame avoidance for grievances that underpin popular or foreign threats. I investigate the effects of a dictator purging an elite to scapegoat them in an online survey experiment in Egypt and Russia. Conducting the survey in these diverse autocratic contexts will permit greater exploration of the scope conditions of the effects of scapegoating. Results from a pilot survey suggest that scapegoating can work by helping dictators improve popular support for their rule. Funding has been secured to field the survey to at least 1,500 respondents in each of Egypt and Russia in March 2022. Beyond the average treatment effects, the survey will also assess heterogeneous treatment effects based on respondents’ education and partisan identity, while causal mediation analysis will probe the mechanisms that underpin scapegoating. Findings from the experiment will improve our knowledge of the effects of purges, and also improve our understanding of the foundations of popular support for autocratic rule.	Comparative Politics

Authoritarian regimes understand the danger of an informed citizenry to the status quo and therefore employ many resources at developing strategies directed at manipulating the media landscape. Simultaneously, increased globalization and access to information through the internet have forced many autocrats to think creatively when seeking to manipulate and control the flow of information. This paper explores how media companies behave in response to legislature aimed at rewarding loyal media actors. To do this I exploit a recent Russian media reform of regional television in a quasi-experimental design. I use a differences-in-differences strategy to investigate how regime distribution of spoils affects levels of pro-regime bias in news content. I employ an original and comprehensive dataset of regional news broadcasts across Russia covering more than half a decade. Furthermore, I use a novel approach to measure levels of pro-regime bias in news broadcasts in autocratic settings using supervised machine learning. Additionally, this paper illuminates how company ownership as well as demographic, political and socio-economic factors across regions influence company response to receiving legislative spoils from the regime.

The hope of many emerging governance efforts such as municipal and city networks is that policies will then spread further and diffuse. Thus, policy diffusion has become a major governance approach in local climate policy. However, whether and how climate policy diffusion works remains severely underexplored. The present paper addresses this gap by studying the spread of adaptation policies at the local level, an integral part of climate policy where top-down governance is scarce and policy needs and effects are highly localized. Drawing on original representative survey data from municipalities in the State of Hessen in Germany (N=217), we test among several interest-, rights-, ideology-, and recognition-driven diffusion mechanisms (linked with the better-known mechanisms of coercion, learning, competition, and emulation) and their potential contribution to spreading local climate change adaptation policy. Our analysis relies on spatial regression models and connectivity matrices informed by multiple diffusion mechanism. We also study whether these mechanisms are conditional on socio-economic characteristics such as the size of municipalities. The results advance our understanding of policy diffusion by showing the (relative) contribution of different diffusion mechanisms for spreading adaptation policies. They are also important for policy-makers wishing to bank on policy diffusion to advance local resilience to climate change impacts.	Public Policy Administration

Conceptualizing the urban environment as a site of governance (Horak and Young 2012), this paper studies the role of external pressures, particularly federal policy incentives, in shaping municipal policymaking. Having identified three major policy innovations at the federal level, this paper uses a multimethod approach - event history analysis and qualitative case studies – to analyze the political, institutional, and contextual factors affecting the speed of adoption at the local level. The focus on policymaking at the municipal level fills an important gap in the academic literature on homelessness, which thus far neglects the complex policy processes at play and an assessment of patterns of policy responses across the United States. Further, centering the city in investigating the dynamics of policy development and adoption in multi-level systems of governance contributes insights for a variety of policy fields, and allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexity of policy making at the municipal level and the role of individual actors, local conditions, and intergovernmental pressures in determining policy choice.

However, existing studies do not address how tax governance dynamics change when elected officials are deeply embedded in the community they govern. In this study, I show that ""neighbor politicians"" are able to strengthen the fiscal contract, due to their greater knowledge of the local community, access to informal networks, and higher levels of trust by the tax base/electorate. Conversely, my evidence suggests that the likelihood of state capture by local elites and organized crime do not seem to increase with embeddedness. Combining granular administrative data and original survey evidence, I substantiate this argument with evidence from the case of Italian mayors. Through an electoral regression discontinuity design, I show that mayors native to the town increase enforcement expenditure, face lower levels of tax contestation, and are able to increase tax rates and revenue. Similarly, novel survey time series show that native mayors elicit greater trust from the community. Finally, an original survey replicates this finding descriptively, further showing respondents expecting native mayors to hold greater knowledge of the community.	Public Policy Administration

Despite extensive research on the consequences of direct democracy for civic engagement, this question has received little scholarly attention. Drawing on a spatial model of issue voting, I argue that referendums lead to a re-alignment between voters and parties, with “Yes” and “No” voters moving closer to the parties that share their own issue positions. I test this argument empirically using cross-sectional surveys and panel data related to five referendums that took place between 2015 and 2016 in Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Preliminary results show that support for parties changes substantially following referendum results in each country, with some voters “switching” to the parties that are aligned with their own position on the referendum proposals. Left-right ideology, however, plays a crucial role, since the likelihood of vote switching increases as the ideological distance between voters and parties decreases.In addition to this data analysis, I am planning to conduct a survey experiment with a representative sample of Italian voters in the context of an upcoming wave of referendums in spring 2022. The experiment aims to test the theorized causal mechanism of issue voting underlying observational data. I will present the experimental results at EPSA 2022. These findings have important implications not only for our understanding of how citizens make voting decisions in referendums, but also for putting into perspective elites’ ability to influence public opinion, and, more broadly, for the connection between direct and representative democracies.

Recent research of leadership performance during the COVID-19 crisis also provided inconclusive results.By using key methodologies, different than other recent research projects, including focusing only on European countries, covering multiple performance dimensions of health, economy, and public support, and by analyzing at pandemic waves / sub-waves levels, we have found a significant effect of country leader’s gender on country performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a significant difference in health performance and in attaining public support favoring female leaders. Female leaders improved their performance between the pandemic waves not only absolutely but also relatively in comparison to male leaders. We have found an indication that the key factor creating the health difference is the ability of female leaders to slow the number of infections and deaths during the first phase of the wave.We believe that attention to empirical evidence that challenges subjective cultural beliefs about gender and leadership can have crucial implications on the success in containing future global health crisis.

Democracy, State Capacity, and the Covid-19 Pandemic	33	We discuss and analyze how political institutions shape the abilities and incentives of political leaders to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. More specifically, we discuss how political regime type and state capacity affect government responses. We argue that there is likely a complementary relationship between democracy and state capacity, both in terms of mitigating actual consequences of the pandemic, such as deaths, and the honest reporting of these consequences. We expect higher state capacity to mitigate disease severity in different contexts, but more so in democratic countries. Expectations are unclear as to how democracies perform in mitigating disease severity in weak-capacity states, but we anticipate that democracy mitigates disease severity in high-capacity states. Further, we expect that both high state capacity and democracy reduce underreporting of disease severity through, respectively, enhancing the capabilities to detect and register Covid-19 deaths and increasing the incentives to report them honestly. Using a recent, global dataset on officially reported Covid-19 deaths and estimated deaths based on excess mortality, we find evidence supporting different implications from our argument. Democracies have much higher officially reported death tolls than autocracies, but this basically reflects underreporting in autocracies. In high-capacity states, democracies have fewer actual deaths, as proxied by excess mortality, than autocracies. State capacity, generally, seems to mitigate both actual deaths and underreporting, and these relationships are stronger in democracies. Countries that combine democracy and high state capacity experience fewer Covid-19 deaths and provide their citizens with a much more accurate toll of the pandemic’s consequences.

A potential explanation has been found in the structural inequalities in who participates, especially in those forms of direct political participation.The paper investigates the potential positive effect of social trust on individual perception of government responsiveness. Research shows, in fact, that social trust contributes to build strong social networks which have the potential to mobilize people to take part in various political conversation and activities. By encouraging citizens’ political participation, we expect to find a direct, positive effect of social trust on public perceptions government responsiveness.Finally, the use of survey data from the European Social Survey (ESS) allows to analyse how the relationship varies, not only according to socio-demographic characteristics, but also across a large and diverse sample of political institutions.

Despite the crucial role played by the education system in enabling or limiting economic mobility we know little about how citizens perceive the fairness of educational opportunities. In this paper we investigate the extent to which educational institutions and mobility outcomes feed back into public perceptions of the fairness of the education system. We use data from Western Europe in the 2018-19 European Social Survey, alongside newly collected data on institutional equality to investigate the relationship between educational mobility, educational institutions, and perceptions of fairness. Our results suggest that individuals perceive fairer educational opportunities when mobility is high, although they appear to be more responsive to educational outcomes than to institutional contexts. Importantly, the association between mobility outcomes and fairness perceptions appears to be conditional on individuals’ prior ideological beliefs, with a stronger association among conservative than leftist respondents. By contrast, we find only weak evidence for patterns of feedback consistent with the idea that social norms about fairness in education are endogenously shaped by educational institutions. Our results suggest that educational institutions play an important role in shaping perceptions of fairness, albeit conditional on individuals pre-existing ideological perspectives.

Yet, in addition to cross-national differences between authoritarian legislatures, many authoritarian legislatures also develop and become stronger or weaker over time (de jure and de facto). While traditional studies have highlighted that legislative institutions become stronger as their electoral procedures become more competitive, my data suggest that legislative development is not always linked to liberalization sequences in dictatorships. Therefore, this study will analyze the questions of when and why parliaments become stronger in authoritarian regimes. For this purpose, it utilizes panel data from autocracies and their legislatures between 1946 and 2010 compiled from datasets such as V-Dem and the Autocratic Regime Features Dataset. The results highlight that one of the primary drivers for legislators to push for more power of their institution is their desire for self-enrichment. My findings demonstrate that members of parliament will primarily advance the role of the legislature when there are more opportunities for clientelism and corruption in a given regime. Understanding this development will help us to understand the dynamics of power distribution in dictatorships better. This study probes when and why parliaments become stronger in dictatorships. Using panel data from autocracies and their legislatures, the results show that a primary driver for legislators to push for more power is their desire for self-enrichment.	Comparative Politics

However, it is less clear what our expectations are if congruence is assessed (i) in a multidimensional space at (ii) varying levels of proportionality within a single political entity, such as in the elections to the European Parliament. I argue that more proportionality is associated with more congruence, but this is less a consequence of spatial incentives than of vote-seat conversion effects. Using a novel measure for multidimensional congruence---Hutchinsonian hypervolumes---, I find empirical support for this assumption based on the EP elections of 2009, 2014, and 2019. Furthermore, higher levels of legislative congruence at a national level are associated with higher levels of trust towards the EU at an individual level, indicating that representational mismatches matter for support for the EU more generally.

How legislatures affect outcomes in authoritarian regimes, and why they exist in the first place are central puzzles in research on authoritarian politics. A prominent argument holds that authoritarian legislatures are instruments of power-sharing which constrain dictators while allowing them to co-opt elites as well as potential opponents. Therefore, legislatures serve the function of stabilizing autocratic rule. In contrast, we argue that under certain conditions legislatures have the opposite effect. When autocratic rule co-exists with powerful ethnoreligious cleavages, the presence of an elected legislature can have destabilizing effects if inclusion is selective and reinforces the exclusion of specific ethno-religious groups. Excluded groups are in fact more likely to respond to elected legislatures with an escalation of terrorism and violent conflict. We test this argument with new data on terrorism by ethnic and ethno-religious groups in autocracies (1970-2016). By explicitly examining the ethno-political context of authoritarian regimes and legislatures, we demonstrate that legislatures, if not carefully designed, can worsen political violence in autocracies and ultimately undermine a dictator’s survival in office.

Some have linked this trend to an insufficient degree of animosity and lack of limited competition between government and opposition, presumably leading to dissatisfaction among citizens with the choices presented to them by the parties, and as a corollary, with the democratic institutions in general. Radical and populist parties thrive on this dissatisfaction at the expense of the culprit mainstream parties.Interestingly, though, while extensive research has been dedicated to citizens’ satisfaction with democracy and its determinants, little has been done to study the role of actual actions of politicians.This paper explores the effect of government-opposition conflict in parliament on voters' satisfaction with democracy. I Draw on government-opposition voting data from 10 democracies over 34 parliamentary terms, linked with survey data of over 25,000 respondents from the CSES project. I find a strong and significant positive effect, whereby higher levels of government-opposition conflict are correlated with higher levels of satisfaction, even when controlling for various individual-, parliament- and system-level factors. Moreover, this relationship also applies in both consensus and majoritarian systems.The contribution of this paper is manifold, both to the study of legislative behaviour and of satisfaction with democracy, highlighting the importance not only of the governing parties' performance but of all represented parties, including the opposition.

Political parties and voters over nationalism issue.	759	Political parties and voters have to deal with exogenous shocks during electoral campaigns. In addition, electoral campaigns are increasing in terms of time and issues. Decentralization and nationalism in multilevel countries is still outstanding issue. Dealing with ethno-regionalist parties claims and the voters’ sense of belonging from the state-wide parties builds interest and differences across countries and parties. Party and voters positions over nationalism have been changing over time. Have the voters more radicalized positions over nationalism feeling to differentiate from their opponents? Or are they trying to maintain the “median” position? The primary assumption is that voters change their position over nationalism due to referendums. To predict voters’ positions over nationalism, I use data from public opinion surveys from the United Kingdom and Spain. I analyze voters and parties positions over nationalism, and the ideological (traditional left-right) scales to find differences in the voters’ self-location and parties’ position before and after referendums. I expect that voters have a radicalized –understood as more extreme- position over nationalism and ideology during the period after the referendums. These results hold relevant implications for studying voters and political parties’ placement over different scales in multilevel countries. Also, the analysis of referendums as a critical shock appears to contribute to the political behaviour field.	Comparative Politics

A number of studies claim that due to COVID-exceptionalism, attitudinal changes are short lived.

We theorise that while elastic changes are the result of materialist motivations, more permanent change is rather driven by other-regarding considerations and re-categorisation processes, spurred by local conditions. Employing cutting-edge natural language processing methods, we use transfer learning to measure attitudes towards redistribution and welfare claimants on a novel dataset of geo-tagged tweets posted in the UK between January 2018 and January 2022.

Most cities respond to this challenge by offering public housing at subsidized rent prices. At the same time, calls for more stringent eligibility criteria that would exclude non-citizens arise from different fronts.Despite the heightened public debate, we know little about the relationship between support for housing policies and immigration. When does public housing generate opposition? To what extent is opposition motivated by real or perceived competition with immigrants? Answering those questions will shed light on the nature of immigrant-native conflict over in-kind welfare benefits, and on the challenges of adapting the welfare state to increasingly diverse societies.To this purpose, I investigate the case of an expansion of public housing in French municipalities that took place between 2001 and 2017. This case presents three main advantages: (i) the policy expands the total pie of welfare benefits, and hence de facto reduces competition, (ii) the National Front consistently argues for excluding non-citizens, (iii) the policy design allows to elicit exogenous variation in public housing assignment. Leveraging on two identification strategies, this paper shows that public housing fuels support for FN in municipalities that historically host a large number of immigrants. However, in municipalities with few immigrants, the policy generates a decline in support for FN in favor of extreme left-wing parties. The evidence suggests a role for perceived (but not realized) competition over welfare benefits to be the driving force behind the results.	Comparative Politics

In contrast, the critics of MSEs are concerned that hosting a MSE allows the regime to consolidate power internally and gain international recognition, impeding the likelihood of positive long-term changes. I use cross-national panel data over a period of more than 70 years and a diverse set of empirical methods–interactive fixed effects counterfactual estimator, synthetic difference-in-differences, and synthetic control–which together provide a robust analysis of the effects of MSEs on indices of democratization and human rights. The results show no significant long-term effect on democratization and human rights. The analyses presented in this article imply that the power of MSEs to foster democratization and human rights is limited.	Comparative Politics

EU Accession and Chinese Investment in CEE Countries	794	Chinese investment in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has been expanding in recent years. As the economic ties deepen, security concerns also rise with arguments decrying Chinese investment and loans as a Trojan horse aiming at buying off political support and influence. On the other hand, some recent studies suggest that the flow of Chinese capital has been exaggerated by politicians from different fronts. My study contributes to the understanding of Chinese investment in CEE by examining whether it follows a ""divide and rule"" strategy. I argue if such a strategy holds Chinese capital should increase disproportionally in CEE countries that have recently joined the EU after adjusting for the inflation that can be attributed to the economic advantages of EU membership. Using the latest Global Chinese Development Finance Dataset from AidData, I apply a difference in differences (DID) design to test whether Chinese capital in CEE is driven mostly by geopolitical or economic motivations.

The pandemic and policy responses to curb SARS-CoV-2 cases in the US sharply increased unemployment. We investigate whether there was economic voting in the 2020 election, that is, whether increased unemployment rate during the pandemic negatively affected Trump’s vote. We examine the eight closely contested ‘battleground states’ where Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Using triple-differences (DDD) models by state (that is, examining changes in a candidate's county-level vote-share depending on the change in unemployment and historical Republican-Democrat partisanship), we find that there was a significant effect of unemployment change in a number of battleground states. We then use these models to predict what would have happened if the increase in unemployment rate in spring 2020 had been half of the actual value. Although Biden would have still secured enough electoral votes to win the presidency according to the predictions, the result would have been far closer.	Comparative Politics

Scholars have recorded a close association between health crises and the prevalence of antisemitic stereotypes and the occurrence of antisemitic violence. We show that a similar relationship holds for the Covid-19 pandemic, and explore the reasons behind this relationship. We argue that pandemics can activate cultural scripts linking the spread of infectious diseases to Judaism, especially among Christian conservatives. We rule out alternative explanations that relate the activation of antisemitic stereotypes to modern forms of antisemitism, in particular right-wing ideology. Our data come from an original survey (n=17,800) fielded in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work demonstrates the deep cultural roots of exclusionary political attitudes and the mechanisms behind their activation.	Comparative Politics

This paper studies the effects of government opposition on willingness to comply with the obligation to wear masks, social distancing, and lockdowns measures. We use original survey data examining attitudes during the pandemic in 11 European countries. We find that government opposition decreases compliance, particularly when the costs of compliance increase. Moreover, our findings indicate that right-wing respondents oppose most measures even when costs are minimal. Finally, we show that political motivations trump respondents’ risk perceptions and economic motivations.	Comparative Politics

A Comparative Study on the Determinants of Election Postponement	1207	Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, there were more than 150 countries and territories that had had elections scheduled, and half of these scheduled elections had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The scheduled elections include more than 100 national- and regional-level elections, and about 50 national-level elections and referendums. The other side of the coin is, however, that half of the scheduled elections could have been held as planned. This paper aims to examine why some elections are postponed while others are held as scheduled. This study will test a set of hypotheses on the determinants of election postponement in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide systematic analyses of comprehensive cross-national data, incorporating a wide set of data not only concerning the COVID-related factors, but also the economic and political contexts and institutional characteristics. The findings will contribute to the literature on the impact of crises and disasters on democratic processes by characterizing the underlying drivers of election postponement in the era of the pandemic. The study’s findings will also contribute to our understanding of the management of democracy under crises and the predictability of the fate of (different types of) elections in the prolonged period of the pandemic.

What shapes individuals' attitudes towards security forces? While studies suggest that media can contribute to post-war reconciliation and stability, we investigate potentially adverse effects of inflammatory broadcasts. We argue that exposure to incendiary media can have a lasting negative impact on people's trust in security forces. To test our argument, we take advantage of exogenous variation in the reception of inflammatory radio programs in Nepal's Western Terai region. Drawing on a quasi-experimental research design and original data from a survey of about 2,000 respondents, we find empirical evidence for individuals being less likely to view the police as a guarantor and protector of individual security in areas with access to inflammatory broadcasts. Our study has important implications for understanding micro-dynamics of post-conflict stability and prospects for state-building.	International Relations and Conflict

Yet, we do not know much about how the public reacts to such pardons. Since pardons overrule judicial decisions, they could impact institutional trust or attitudes towards punitive justice. In this paper, we use an original two-wave panel survey to examine the effects of the pardon of Catalan secessionist leaders by the Spanish government in June 2021. Our design takes advantage of the fact that these pardons took place in between our two survey waves, which allows us to precisely identify individual-level effects. We find that the pardons have average negative effects on political trust (e.g., Prime Minister, Spanish Government, Courts) and, for those living outside Catalonia, on interpersonal trust. Also, we identify average positive effects on attitudes towards punitive justice and on views of the Catalan territorial conflict. At the same time, we document strong partisan divides in attitudes towards political pardons, and we find that the aforementioned effects vary significantly across partisan lines. A clear divide emerges between voters of right-wing parties (i.e., PP, Cs, VOX) and voters of left-wing and peripheral parties (i.e., Podemos, ERC, PNV, etc.). Our results have implications for political pardon as an institution, as well as for the prospects of resolution of the territorial conflict in Spain.	Comparative Politics

I exploit variation on locations of European slave ports, and combine it with time variation arising from the Americas’ sudden increased demand for African slaves in 1680. Using data on ruler duration on over 2,500 precolonial African rulers in the period between 1200 and 1900, I show that African rulers after 1680 had shorter lengths of ruler tenure if they were situated in the vicinity of slave ports. These findings are supported by IV-estimation that uses the distance from slave destinations in the Americas to instrument for proximity to slave ports in Africa.	Comparative Politics

Do they substitute for the status-quo system or complement it? What are the consequences on the welfare of the general population?I explore this question in the historical context of late Ancien Regime France. The bureaucracy was then mainly composed of “venal” officeholders, who purchased their positions: this made them dependent on the stability of the regime and provided short-term funds to the state, but the state had only limited control over them. From the late 17thcentury, the monarchy introduced new non-venal bureaucrats, the intendants, who did not purchase their positions and could be dismissed at will. The central state could control intendants more easily, and for this reason they are often considered as proto-modern bureaucrats.I analyze data on these two different kinds of bureaucrats. I take advantage of digitized National Archives inventories and build a novel dataset of more than 125,000 venal officeholders during the 1724-1790 period. I combine it with information on intendants and finance ministers’ tenure. I explore whether the appointment of centralized bureaucrats limits or promotes the proliferation of venal offices.In preliminary results, I find that the appointment of a new intendant in a province systematically leads to the sale of new fiscal office positions, which points to a complementarity mechanism. I then explore the broader welfare consequences of these dynamics, using data on popular rebellions.	Comparative Politics

Yet, not much is known about the characteristics and determinants of rulers’ itineraries. We argue that rulers maximize the payoff of their travelling by targeting areas lacking trustworthy agents that could substitute for the ruler’s physical presence. We test this argument focusing on the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire between AD 751–1519. We reconstruct emperors’ itineraries through information on ca. 145’000 documented, dated, and geolocated activities they engaged in. We geographically locate emperors’ closest agents by recurring to their immediate family members (uncles, aunts, siblings, and children) via their (time-variant) titles. Taken together, these data allow us to estimate the effect of the geographical spread of an emperor’s agents on his travels, both within and across reigns. Variation in the natural death of family members and emperors allows for causal identification within and across reigns, respectively. The results of our analysis will shed light on an understudied pre-modern political phenomenon that leaves its trace in the travels of statesmen and -women today.	Comparative Politics

An analysis of MEP-citizen opinion congruence in the European Parliament (1999-2015)	603	Eurosceptic and populist political entrepreneurs claim that they are the ‘voice of the people’ against corrupt elites. Over time they have increased their representation in the European Parliament (EP). Some tend to have much higher representation at the supranational compared to the national level. Against this, we ask: are their views actually congruent with their voters in EP elections? We study how opinion corresponds between MEPs and those they represent, at four fixed points in time between 1999 and 2015 on two major political dimensions, namely the left-right and pro-anti EU integration dimensions. We use data from MEP surveys carried out by the European Parliament Research Group (Hix et al. 2016, Whitaker et al. 2017) and European Election Study voter surveys (van Egmond et al. 2013; Schmitt et al. 2009, 2015). Our longitudinal and comparative design allows us to consider potential changes in the quality of democratic representation in the EP over time, taking into account the expansion of the EP’s legislative authority, European Union enlargement and the rise of Euroscepticism. Our findings indicate a mixed picture and have implications for our understanding of representation in the European Union.	European Politics

Party recognition can be an important asset to interest groups and it can furthermore signal where the party stands on an issue to the public at large and other EU actors (Fraussen et al., 2018). Although previous research has shown that individual members of parliament in the eighth EP were more likely to recognize prominent, ideologically similar interest groups from their own member states (Ibenskas and Bunea, 2021), little is known about changes over time and other drivers of recognition. This paper investigates party recognition of interest groups across all EP speeches between 1999-2019, thus covering recognition before and after the Lisbon Treaty that further empowered the EP entered into force, and the effects of party and issue characteristics on recognition. With their increased cohesiveness and the EP’s increased powers, EP party groups are likely attractive targets for interest groups that seek to influence EU policy decisions and examining who parties choose to recognize as relevant actors contributes to broader research on interest group access and interest group politics in the EU. EP party groups moreover serve an important representative function and understanding party recognition of interest groups sheds further light on whose interests the parties represent.

Previous scholarly work is primarily concerned with how challenger parties get elected but overlooked the consequences of their success for democratic institutions. This is a serious shortcoming because challenger parties’ strategies within institutions – especially, in parliament – matter for democratic deliberation and representation. This article analyses how the policy and rhetorical strategies of challenger parties play out in the parliamentary arena. It argues that parliamentarians’ incentives regarding rhetorical choices differ systematically depending on their status as members of challenger or dominant parties. Whilst the latter need to balance policy-, office-, and vote-seeking strategies, the former’s primary goal is to maximize electoral success. This makes challenger party parliamentarians engage in anti-establishment rhetoric and issue entrepreneurship conditionally on the expected electoral returns. The analysis tests this argument on a new dataset of speeches given in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2017. The article develops a novel measure of anti-establishment rhetoric and issue-entrepreneurship in parliamentary debates combining word embeddings and dictionaries. It also innovatively links this measure to public opinion and expert survey data. By highlighting the situational and strategic element of challenger parties’ communication, this article makes an important contribution because it improves the understanding of challenger party success and its consequences for democratic, legislative institutions.

Reliably identifying NC at large scale in SM is a challenge to researchers. Most literature focuses on the US, where the two-party system makes NC easier to identify then in multiparty systems with multiple and potentially dynamic targets. Here, we also find coalition signals and acclaims of other parties.To tackle this, we apply a detailed strategy-level manual coding (attack, acclaim) to N∼50,000 posts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) from candidates standing in three federal and five state elections in Germany from 2013 to 2021. Since NC is relatively rare and often combined with other strategies, post level coding seems insufficient. We introduce a novel approach of annotator rationales to overcome previous limitations. In addition to coding the strategy, human coders explicitly mark parts of text indicative for their coding decision. We create a more precise training set for supervised learning and use a BERT transformer to maximize performance, comparing it to numerous algorithms. Results show that NC is relatively rare (< 6 percent of all messages). We correctly identify about 60% of all attacks out of sample with an overall accuracy of .94 on unbalanced data. Using annotator rationales improves the F1 score of attacks compared to a post-level coding from .60 to .67. While NC is identifiable via automated text analysis, social media communication makes it difficult to detect specific campaign strategies, underscoring the fruitfulness of our targeted approach.

It has been proposed that personalization of politics has led to the decline of preferential votes for the candidates other than party leaders due to ‘centralized’ personalization of politics (Wauters et al. 2018). Changes in the media consumption and increasing role of TV have been driving personalization of politics and consequently the use of preferential votes by voters (Elmelund-Praestekaer and Hopmann 2012). In order to analyze the long-term media effects on preferential voting, we use the preferential voting data from six parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic held between 2002 and 2021 combined with data on media presence of candidates in various media types (TV, radio, print and online). The level of preferential voting for candidates on different ballot positions remains rather stable over the 20 year-long period. In addition, the higher media exposure is indeed associated with higher number of preferential votes. However, when media types are distinguished, the presence of candidates in TV does not have a significant positive effect on preferential votes unlike other types of media such as print newspaper and online media.

These conspiracies lead to lower compliance with safety measures and reduce vaccination uptake, putting the entire world at risk. Anecdotally, it appears that populists have been instrumental in the spread of Covid-19 conspiracies, and theory would lead us to expect that: we know that populist attitudes are related to conspiratorial thinking among the public; and we know that populist discourse has elements, such as the anti-elitist appeal, that border on conspiracism. However, to date the evidence that populist politicians are more likely to spread conspiracy theories is very limited. We test that with a dataset containing all Facebook posts by every member of parliament in six EU countries plus the UK in 2020 and 2021.

Results reveal that right-wing populists were on average more likely to share Covid-19-related conspiracies, but that there are still important variation within and across countries. These results are the first systematic cross-national evidence that populist actors do engage more in spreading conspiracies, and help us understand how they build their appeal in a time of crisis.

Using this measure, we are able to analyze emotional appeals in populist rhetoric in much more detail than previous approaches.

Measuring populism in multi-lingual parliamentary speeches and manifestos.	1194	Due to the malleable nature of populism, it has proven notoriously difficult to measure the concept reliably and independently of an actors’ host ideology in text. Hitherto, there is hardly any comparative empirical evidence on the distribution of populism across time, countries, or parties in party systems. Empirical studies usually focus on one party or single party systems at one election, and studies are often biased towards the radical right. Drawing on a new typology, I measure each constituent component of populism individually in text. I create a dataset of 165,700 hand-coded single ‘sentences in context’ from party manifestos and parliamentary speeches at a high reliability without providing coders with any information on the political speaker to avoid bias. I measure populist and several anti-populist positions on a hitherto unprecedented scope for five European party systems, using 633 party manifestos from 1960-2021, as well as 3 million legislative speeches from 1990-2018. I iteratively create one extensive dictionary per concept, language, and country-context, to filter potential candidate sentences to be hand-coded. The findings demonstrate a high face and convergent validity across party systems and data sources. The findings show that that there is a populist-anti-populist divide across party systems, where populism is more prevalent in democratic radical left-wing, radical right-wing and regionalist parties. Long-established mainstream parties are anti-populist, while non-democratic parties demonstrate defected types of populism. The findings contribute to the measurement of political positions and concepts, and to the study of (anti-)populism and the supply side of party competition.	Political Communication

I conjecture that in Russia, state-controlled news published online, for consumption by a digitally literate audience, exhibits less pro-regime bias than programming created for those who rely on national television to learn about daily affairs. I test the conjecture using three data sets: headlines displayed on the Yandex News Aggregator, transcripts of evening news on Channel 1, and reports from a private news agency, Interfax, examining how daily reporting varied in topics across the media outlets. Using crowdsourcing, supervised machine learning, and dictionary techniques, I analyse 70,000 news reports from August 2018 - March 2020. Results indicate that the state-controlled online platform, in contrast to national television channels, demonstrates less tendency to censor stories about political opposition and bad economic news, but promotes stronger measurable bias in the coverage of foreign affairs, specifically news that involves Ukraine and the US.

However, the identity of the populist ingroup remains ambiguous, theoretically only defined by its unity, which is the precondition for the formulation of a common will (volonté general), and by its opposition to other groups, namely elites and, in the case of right-wing populism, “dangerous others”. But which group-references are used by different political actors when talking about the people? Research on the empirical characteristics of the populist ingroup beyond homogeneity and demarcation is scarce. I argue that references to the people (and its antagonists) is context-dependent, differing across party status and ideology, country and time, and that there is no single identity of the ingroup, but rather that the people have many faces. To identify and systematize the identity of the in- and outgroup(s) of populist political communication, this study makes use of a novel method, extending dictionary analysis with word embeddings. These specialized group dictionaries are applied to a corpus of election manifestos, press releases and tweets from political parties in Austria, Germany and Switzerland to study long- as well as short-term trends.

Measuring populist rhetoric using text as data is far from trivial, however, because it is fundamentally oppositional and highly context dependent. Populist speech is oppositional in nature because it relies on the distinction between “the people” and the establishment, and it is context dependent because what constitutes opposition varies depending on the issue in question. Dictionary-based approaches are a transparent way of quantifying speech patterns, but they lack the ability to appropriately deal with the nuance and conditionality that defines political rhetoric. To overcome these issues, we use supervised machine learning to classify 1.6 million tweets about the Coronavirus pandemic by Conservative and Labour MPs in the United Kingdom, as well as Conservative and Labour sympathizers. Our classifier is based on expert coding of five thousand tweets about the Coronavirus pandemic and provides a fine-grained measure along four dimensions: issue, stance, type of rhetoric, and populist vs governmental orientation. Using this measure, we are able to analyze emotional appeals in populist rhetoric in much more detail than previous approaches. Hence, we provide a substantive analysis of populist rhetoric during the Coronavirus pandemic, and we conclude by offering technical guidance on the computational analysis of populist discourse using supervised machine learning.

These conspiracies lead to lower compliance with safety measures and reduce vaccination uptake, putting the entire world at risk. Anecdotally, it appears that populists have been instrumental in the spread of Covid-19 conspiracies, and theory would lead us to expect that: we know that populist attitudes are related to conspiratorial thinking among the public; and we know that populist discourse has elements, such as the anti-elitist appeal, that border on conspiracism. However, to date the evidence that populist politicians are more likely to spread conspiracy theories is very limited. We test that with a dataset containing all Facebook posts by every member of parliament in six EU countries plus the UK in 2020 and 2021. We first identify a list of approximately ten thousand websites which engaged with spreading fake news, and then look at what politicians are more likely to share covid-19 conspiracies from those links. Results reveal that right-wing populists were on average more likely to share Covid-19-related conspiracies, but that there are still important variation within and across countries. These results are the first systematic cross-national evidence that populist actors do engage more in spreading conspiracies, and help us understand how they build their appeal in a time of crisis.

With a multifaced crisis taking place, an increase of fear, anxiety, and insecurity within the population (Kumar & Nayar, 2020) was observed. The consequences of the COVID19 crisis created along with the health and social concerns, a fast rise in economic insecurity (Fetzer et al., 2020), including job and financial insecurity due to steep rises in unemployment rates in the European Union. Under circumstances of sudden shocks such as the COVID-19 crisis, democracies, governments, and political parties have become crucial actors to address the consequences of the crisis. Hence, this paper investigates whether political parties have devoted attention to the increasing job insecurity felt by citizens during the COVID-19 crisis and if so, how have they addressed the issue. To do so, an automated text analysis from Twitter posts was used for measuring party positions and preferences on job insecurity in the European Union countries during the first stages of the crisis. The results suggest that attention has especially been paid by the left-wing parties who as a rule own the labour market issue. Yet, at the same time, special attention has been given by the populist radical right parties who do not hold ownership for the labour issue but have adopted a more protectionist approach when compared to mainstream right-wing parties.

Therefore, we so far know little whether and if so, how extreme weather events can trigger anti-government protests. This paper intends to fill this gap by arguing that these are the sorts of conflict where actually an effect is most plausible. Protests require little formal, long-term organization, are associated with low opportunity costs, involve lower personal risk and entail less complicated coordination than large-scale conflicts. In addition, specific societal circumstances should exacerbate the effect of extreme weather events on protests. Extreme weather events should be more likely to trigger protests if different social groups possess unequal political assertiveness. If weaker social groups struggle to obtain compensation through regular political channels for the adverse consequences of extreme weather events, the incentive for staging protests should increase. Since riots and demonstrations require spontaneous mass-scale mobilization, which is more feasible in urban areas, such a protest-inducing effect of extreme weather events should mainly occur in densely populated areas.This paper puts the argument to empirical scrutiny. Using a spatial multi-level regression analysis based on grid-months as units of observation, the results provide support for the theoretical argument: Grid-months characterized by extreme weather events are indeed more likely to see protests. This effect is even more pronounced in states where weaker social groups possess little political power and in more densely populated regions.	International Relations and Conflict

For instance, in the US context, when Democrats and Republicans respond to the same information (e.g., economic indicators) in polarizing ways or a gulf emerges in surveys (e.g., support for Covid-19 vaccines) then these differences are usually attributed to the process of motivated reasoning. This theory posits that polarization is the result of an automatic, subconscious process fueled by hot cognition. Attitude polarization, however, can be the result of a variety of different processes that are not fueled by automatic biased information processing. It could emerge because members of different social groups update their beliefs from uncommon priors or because people consciously distort their opinions to align with their social identity.This paper introduces original experimental manipulations that disentangle the mechanisms driving attitude polarization. Across multiple experiments with diverse applications to US politics (e.g., response to economic information, responses to politically violent rhetoric) and using different salient social groups (e.g., partisanship, race), the paper showcases how not all attitude polarization is created equal. While some divergence is attributable to motivated reasoning, results suggest that much of the polarization traditionally credited to this process is actually the result of conscious and deliberate attitude distortion as well as people evaluating the same information using different rational standards. Taken together, the paper showcases that research needs to be more precise when examining attitude polarization as well as the need to probe the mechanisms underlying such polarization.

Political discussions between members of opposing groups have the potential to reduce affective polarization, but studies to date take place in heavily moderated settings, avoid politics and quell potential division. This leaves open the question of whether their findings apply in a real-world, affectively polarized environment in which people are divided on contentious issues. To answer this question, this study first uses data from political chat discussions organised in the run-up to the Dutch 2021 general election. Random matching of subjects to an unresponsive partner is exploited for causal inference. Using expectations derived from contact theory and the deliberation literature, results show that a political discussion of only 20 minutes increases a subject’s expressed sympathy for people from the other side of the political spectrum. This result also apply to the most polarized supporters of far right parties. The results are then replicated and extended with an online experiment on the same chat platform, which tests the effect of a conversation on polarisation, social distance, and support for political compromise. The second study also varies the topic of conversation, the ideological distance between discussing partisans, and conducts quantitative and qualitative text analyses of the chat discussions, to shed light on possible mechanisms.

We explore potential connections between these developments. Rather than focus on partisan polarization, we analyze intra-party division among Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives’ engagement with far-right alternative news media during the 116th Congress. We develop three discrete measures to scale representatives’ positions using hyperlinks to far-right websites on Twitter. We demonstrate a strong association between these measures of news media engagement and proxies for ideological position, including roll-call voting, caucus membership, and political rhetoric. These findings have implications for our understanding of intra-party divisions and elite-media interaction in a fragmented media system. They provide further insight into divisions within the modern congressional Republican Party, and offer a new metric for scaling elites’ political positions, using hyperlinks to ideological news sources.

Previous research shows that far-right actors are central actors in political conflicts in Western Europe, partly due to their dominance on contested issues such as migration. Within political conflicts, influence largely depends on actors’ political networks. Yet, we still lack an understanding of networks of far-right actors in public debates, and how they interact within these networks and across issues and critical events. To this end, we investigate the evolution and structure of discourse networks of far-right actors, their linkages with political elites, and the diffusion of their claims on issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration. We apply a multi-method approach to investigate actor-actor and actor-issue relations. First, combining multimodal network analysis with automated text analysis, we analyze networks of far-right actors in mass media (different newspapers) in Germany since 1990 in order to understand long-term dynamics. Second, based on relational content analysis, we focus on contentious episodes after critical moments since 2016 and study social media platforms of far-right actors to further understand their ideological linkages and relationship to issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration. This relational approach allows us to identify how far-right actors are connected and able to speak, introduce, amplify, and maintain issues and shape public contestation not only at critical moments but also in the long-term. This demonstrates how political networks and discursive opportunities of far-right actors have changed and influenced political contestation over time.	Political Communication

We explore potential connections between these developments. Rather than focus on partisan polarization, we analyze intra-party division among Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives’ engagement with far-right alternative news media during the 116th Congress. We develop three discrete measures to scale representatives’ positions using hyperlinks to far-right websites on Twitter. We demonstrate a strong association between these measures of news media engagement and proxies for ideological position, including roll-call voting, caucus membership, and political rhetoric. These findings have implications for our understanding of intra-party divisions and elite-media interaction in a fragmented media system. They provide further insight into divisions within the modern congressional Republican Party, and offer a new metric for scaling elites’ political positions, using hyperlinks to ideological news sources.

Previous research shows that far-right actors are central actors in political conflicts in Western Europe, partly due to their dominance on contested issues such as migration. Within political conflicts, influence largely depends on actors’ political networks. Yet, we still lack an understanding of networks of far-right actors in public debates, and how they interact within these networks and across issues and critical events. To this end, we investigate the evolution and structure of discourse networks of far-right actors, their linkages with political elites, and the diffusion of their claims on issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration. We apply a multi-method approach to investigate actor-actor and actor-issue relations.

New Dimensions and Data for the Study of Elite Defections in Electoral Autocracies	841	While elite unity is the central pillar of authoritarian regime stability, the defection of ruling elites often threatens authoritarian rule. Recent studies show that elite defections are associated with sources of regime vulnerability, emboldening the opposition and led at times the regime breakdown. However, despite the importance of elite defections to understand why autocracies collapse, there has been a shortfall of empirical work and data that examines how elites defect. This paper proposes new dimensions around the concept of elite defection, such as its timing and the way of joining the opposition. The relevance of these dimensions is illustrated with a novel dataset on the political careers of 30,018 deputies and ministers in 24 electoral autocracies. Descriptive analyses lead to the generation of hypotheses that can serve as building blocks for explanatory theory. The findings suggest new research avenues in the field of authoritarian politics and democratization.	Political Institutions

First, we show that the Jury was more likely than the CDLs to clear defendants who were Law graduates, a powerful group in French politics at the time. The difference in clearance rates between Law graduates and other defendants was 10 percentage points higher in front of the Jury than in front of the CDLs. This Law graduate advantage was consequential and created elite persistence, as it mainly appeared when defendants intended on continuing their political careers.Second, a systematic analysis of the still-classified 17,589 documents contained in the Jury dossiers of the defendants is consistent with the hypothesis that the connections of Law graduates to the Jury was a major driver of their ability to avoid the purge.

Such commitment can prevent the breakup of a newly independent country, as well as their alignment with the economic policies preferred by urban elites in exchange for resources from the central government. However, so far little attention has been paid to whether and how this amicable agreement among political elites extends into the executive branch. Does legislative over-representation of rural regions extend into ministerial over-representation? Or are legislative (over-)representation and executive (over-)representation substitutes instead of complements? To answer this question, we constructed a novel dataset on biographies of all Argentinian ministers and legislators from its foundation until today (c. 1830-2019), including detailed information on individuals' province and town of origin, political affiliation, and roles in the public sector. Leveraging this data, we first confirm that the malapportionment promoted by landed elites led rural provinces to be over-represented in the legislature for much of Argentina's history. Second, we show that traditional literature on legislative malapportionment misses half of the story: urban provinces have been historically over-represented in the executive branch, counteracting their under-representation in the legislative branch. We provide evidence that legislative malapportionment endures in part because of an informal agreement whereby urban regions are over-represented in the cabinet.

I consider under which conditions and through which mechanisms lobbying transparency can benefit voters. When politicians' career and policy concerns align (high policy transparency) lobbying transparency requirements have no bite. When politicians' motives clash and generate pandering incentives, lobbying transparency help voters induce better policy-making as well as possibly improve the selection of politicians via elections. Rather than improving the quality of influence, lobbying transparency helps voters either (i) better discipline their politicians, by reducing pandering or (ii) ensure more information transmission from special interest groups. The effect of policy transparency is highly non-monotonic and dependent on lobbying transparency. Conditional on appropriate lobbying transparency standards, more policy transparency may backfire by facilitating the persuasion of elected officials.	Formal Models

However, the conditions under which allies are targeted are not well understood. We investigate how time pressure affects the strategic decision of whom to lobby. We derive conditions on the cost of delaying policies and on the distribution of legislators' preferences for lobbyists to prefer targeting allies. We show that the use of allied intermediaries has important implications for the duration of policy making and the quality of policy choices. Counter-intuitively, an increase in time pressure can increase the duration of policy making and a longer duration does not always lead to better-informed policies.	Formal Models

In response, lobby registers are set up to provide information about the topic, date, and participants of meetings with policymakers. Interest groups use these registers to learn what competing groups are doing and may respond strategically. To evaluate the strategic changes due to increased transparency, I study a formal model where competing interests engage in informational lobbying over time. The focus is on how observing lobbying behavior of competing groups---transparency---affects the amount and timing of information provision. I show that transparency may be disadvantageous because groups are dissuaded from acquiring information if they learn that competitors have disclosed favorable information for their cause. Conversely, transparency allows interest groups to be selective in acquiring information and may lead to more informed decision-making. Further, a transparent institution causes changes in the timing of disclosure because interest groups trade off potentially scaring off competitors with early disclosure and waiting to learn whether further information acquisition is necessary.

We build upon models of partisan identification (e.g., Fiorina 1978) that argue voters choose party affiliation based on their objective experiences under different partisan regimes. We augment this framework by considering voters who think holistically across policy areas, so that observing the outcome on one dimension allows them to draw cross-issue inferences about the effectiveness of multiple components of broader policy programs. In our model, an incumbent enacts a multidimensional policy and voters learn by observing the policy’s outcome on each issue. In equilibrium, the incumbent’s policy choice endogenously influences how much voters learn. As a result, when choosing policy the incumbent must consider how potential outcomes on each dimension will influence subsequent voter beliefs and preferences. We show that the incumbent’s incentives to either focus on a single issue or act on multiple policy dimensions depend on the strength of the correlation across different areas, as well as his ex-ante electoral strength. Furthermore, the incumbent is more likely to act on a secondary dimension when voters care less about it. Finally, the possibility to act on a secondary dimension can induce more or less extremism on the primary one, depending on whether the incumbent is electorally leading or trailing.	Formal Models

We investigate whether female legislators also face greater obstacles than their male counterparts in the legislative arena. We leverage newly collected data on all types of votes including roll-calls in the European Parliament from 2004 to 2021 to assess whether roll-call votes are more frequently called when a woman is in charge of preparing a bill – when she is the rapporteur. We estimate the legislative gender-bias using a matching strategy to neutralise the effect of common causes of roll-call requests that may be related to gender as well, such as party affiliation, seniority, and legislator ideology. Our results shed light on the proper functioning of legislative assemblies which would be distorted by an anti-female bias.	Legislative Studies

Evidence from the German Bundestag, 1949-2021	1130	Gender-inclusive language is an important issue in the struggle for political equality between women and men. Parliaments are a central arena in this struggle as they both reflect and shape gender-relations in society. Based on a novel high-quality corpus of all its debates, we study the evolution of gender-fair language in the German national parliament, Bundestag, between 1949 and 2021. As a “gender language” with a grammatical gender, German offers ideal conditions to inspect semantically symmetric male and female forms of personal nouns. Our analysis of more than 2.5 million occurrences of 1,600 lemmas of personal nouns reveals that female forms had been virtually non-existent in legislative speech before experiencing a stark increase since the 1980s. This evolution has been driven specifically by the gender and partisan affiliation of MPs while there is little evidence for generational effects.	Legislative Studies

We answer this question analyzing the parliamentary offices and political behavior of all Swiss national parliamentarians since 2011 (until 2020). Raising children is costly in terms of money and requires time and attention. However, the responsibility and care for children is often shared unequally between the parents and the social expectations of mothers differ from those fathers have to meet. Hence, we expect and find the effect of parenthood to differ between men and women: while mothers are less likely to be successful, fathers are rewarded in parliament.	Legislative Studies

Evidence from the German Bundestag, 1949-2021	1130	Gender-inclusive language is an important issue in the struggle for political equality between women and men. Parliaments are a central arena in this struggle as they both reflect and shape gender-relations in society. Based on a novel high-quality corpus of all its debates, we study the evolution of gender-fair language in the German national parliament, Bundestag, between 1949 and 2021. As a “gender language” with a grammatical gender, German offers ideal conditions to inspect semantically symmetric male and female forms of personal nouns. Our analysis of more than 2.5 million occurrences of 1,600 lemmas of personal nouns reveals that female forms had been virtually non-existent in legislative speech before experiencing a stark increase since the 1980s. This evolution has been driven specifically by the gender and partisan affiliation of MPs while there is little evidence for generational effects.	Legislative Studies

Currently, this development is hampered by the very limited availability of processed and ready-to-use audio data. This currently leaves audio-as-data approaches inaccessible to many applied researchers. We introduce a new data set of processed audio recordings of more than 20,000 floor speeches in the German Bundestag spanning three legislative terms between 2011 and 2018. Following existing approaches, the data set includes vocal pitch as a measure of legislators' emotional intensity during a speech, but allows the extraction of other quantities as well. The data is harmonized with existing text of speech corpora and thus enables researchers to connect text-as-data approaches with audio data. Because previously existing sources of structured audio data exclusively focus on the US, our data facilitates the testing of theories about legislative speechmaking under an alternative institutional setting. It further paves the way for the integration of audio data into more comparative research programs on legislative speech.Demonstrating the utility of this new source, we show that women legislators in the German Bundestag speak with greater emotional intensity about women-related issues as compared to their male colleagues and other issues. This replicates an earlier result from the US House of Representatives (Dietrich et al. 2019) in a new context. Taking emotional intensity as an indicator of issue commitment, this adds confidence to the finding that an increase in womens' descriptive representation fosters their substantive representation.

We investigate whether female legislators also face greater obstacles than their male counterparts in the legislative arena. We leverage newly collected data on all types of votes including roll-calls in the European Parliament from 2004 to 2021 to assess whether roll-call votes are more frequently called when a woman is in charge of preparing a bill – when she is the rapporteur. We estimate the legislative gender-bias using a matching strategy to neutralise the effect of common causes of roll-call requests that may be related to gender as well, such as party affiliation, seniority, and legislator ideology. Our results shed light on the proper functioning of legislative assemblies which would be distorted by an anti-female bias.	Legislative Studies

Hence, in the ideal world individual political preferences should not play a role in the world of civil service. But what happens when a state treats private political allegiance as a determinant of loyalty and bans civil servants based on their politics? This paper examines the effects of Radikalenerlass (Anti-Radical Decree) introduced in 1972 in the Federal Republic of Germany. While the ban prohibited people associated with all “extremist” groups from taking office, in practice it mostly applied to the supporters of extreme-left parties. The ban was controversial and was gradually revoked on a state-by-state basis, with the last state, Bavaria, ending the practice in 1991. I concentrate on the effects of the ban on two groups: students and civil servants. This allows me to establish the effects that the ban had on (1) limiting the participation of “extremists” in the civil service, (2) self-selection into office and (3) job satisfaction once hired. To address these issues quantitatively, I employ data from the German Socio-Economic Panel 1984-2020, as well as the German Student Survey 1983 – 2016. The findings of this paper are important for several reasons. First, it allows to evaluate the effects of party bans in civil service that are frequently implemented in the process of transitional justice after regime change. Second, it highlights the role of political ideology in motivating selection into civil service and job satisfaction while working.	Public Policy Administration

Deviating from this standard view, I argue that politicians' dependence on bureaucratic effort for re-election purposes allows bureaucrats to exert political power over their elected principals. If bureaucrats are organized in dense unions with strong tenure protections and deviate in their preferences from their principals, they can collectively shirk effort to influence who their superiors are and what policies they choose. To test this theory, I focus on shirking of US municipal police in response to police budget reforms. I leverage the unprecedented $1 billion cut to NYPD’s budget in the New York City Council for FY2021. Using fine-grained data on NYPD 911 response times together with council members’ preferences on the policy change in difference-in-differences designs, I find that response times increase in districts of non-aligned politicians. Supplementary analyses show that the effect is largely driven by calls where police have more discretion, including alarms, past crimes and vehicle accidents. I further rule out alternative explanations, including changes in the demand for police and police-related protests across NYC. This study informs the theoretical debate on principal-agent relationships in government and sheds light on the importance of political interests to explain policing in US cities.

More specifically, I examine when and how young unemployed people internalise external demands to participate in mandatory job placements. The analysis shows that the context of Danish active labour market policies is often, but not always, conducive to successful internalisation of demands for participation in activation. Successful internalisation depends on whether young people feel that they are listened to and respected, that they are able to establish a trusting relationship with case workers and that a rationale for participation is established through dialogue with case workers. Whether successful internalisation happens or not has important implications for young people’s experience of activation as meaningful and the way it influences their wellbeing and motivation. These findings provide important guidelines for the design and implementation of welfare conditionalities. They show both the possibility and the significance of implementing interventions in a way that provides citizens with a feeling of agency and self-determination. In the absence of this, citizens may be left with feelings of anger, disempowerment and demotivation, and interventions implemented in this way may therefore have the opposite effect than intended.

The project begins with a game theoretic model of political competition that integrates norms. This is followed by an experiment that allows me to test the model’s empirical predictions and facilitates structural estimation of key model parameters. I utilize an online survey conducted in the United Kingdom to elicit two types of social norms from respondents: injunctive norms, i.e., beliefs about what others consider to be acceptable behavior, and descriptive norms, i.e., beliefs about the actions of others. In a subsequent experiment, respondents are randomly exposed to information on the choices made in the first survey, which is intended to shift perceptions over democratic norms. Following this manipulation, respondents take part in a candidate-choice conjoint experiment in which respondents indicate which of two politicians they would vote for in a series of hypothetical elections. Moreover, this research design is shaped by qualitative interviews that inform the accuracy of the formal model and frames the experiment.	Formal Models

Yet, the existing research finds no relationship between democracy and student achievement. This paper discusses the reasons for this surprising null finding and argues that the relationship between political regimes and students' learning outcomes varies by school subject. To ensure regime stability and support, autocrats might purposefully restrict the development of young minds in terms of critical thinking. In democratic settings, by contrast, critical reasoning and other skills that students need as democratic citizens and potential political actors can be encouraged by the school curriculum and teaching methods. Distinct political goals reflected in schooling, thus, can lead to cross-national achievement differences in international tests in those disciplines that promote critical thinking.To test the argument that autocracies avoid the cultivation of critical thinking, I employ data from the Harmonized Learning Outcomes database on student performance in mathematics, science, and reading in 164 countries from 2000 to 2017. The results of the time-series cross-section regression analysis with two-way fixed effects demonstrate that democracy indexes are indeed positively and strongly associated with students' scores in reading, which is a subject that requires critical thinking, but not in mathematics and science.

However, until now, other European Union (EU) member states have not reacted strongly; consequences for either country have been minimal so far. Is the European Union stuck in an unfortunate authoritarian equilibrium, as Daniel Kelemen has argued? Or, alternatively, might the lack of repercussions for Hungary and Poland be due to inertia in transnational perceptions of politics in these countries?Political actors and publics in other member states may be slow to change their general beliefs about these countries and their governments, in part because media coverage of those countries has changed little. This paper tests this alternative explanation by analyzing the depiction of Poland and Hungary in leading newspapers in the five largest EU member states: Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain. Across these member states, I compile a unique corpus of tens of thousands of articles mentioning the two countries, and leverage new developments in machine translation and machine learning to analyze and compare them directly.This makes it possible to test, for the first time, several hypotheses about the lack of member state reactions to democratic backsliding, as these five countries vary on geographical distance, historical ties, political affinity, and commercial connections, among others. The findings have implications not just for our understanding of how member states handle intra-EU challenges, but also, more broadly, of how one state’s image of another state may shift over time.

This paper evaluates the legitimacy of the resulting legal system using demoicratic theory.According to demoicratic theory, the EU is a voluntary association of peoples governing together but not as one (Bellamy 2019, Cheneval et al 2015, Nicolaïdis 2013). Demoicracies are typified by a normative commitment to mutual recognition amongst democratic peoples with which a legitimate European rule of law must be consistent.Initially, it is shown that the EU’s existing rule of law enjoys only minimal legitimacy given its establishment through judicial activism and the limitations of its post-facto authorisation by member states. This generates incompatibilities between the resulting transnational rule of law and the demands of demoicratic mutual recognition. Specifically, the national enforcement of EU law cannot be justified through appropriate authorisation but must rely on their functional contribution to the process of European integration (Scharpf 2010).Thereafter, potential solutions are evaluated using the demoicratic paradigm, including: intergovernmental deliberation of fundamental doctrines for the EU legal system through an Ordinary Revision Procedure and, the transition from a strong to a weak judicial review procedure in which courts no longer have the authority to refuse to apply national law but only to issue declarations of incompatibility (Waldron 2006).

The group's cooperation has changed several times over the 30 years, with major changes within the V4 Group at the beginning of 2015 when the migration crisis erupted in Europe and continuing now as Poland and Hungary move away from the values of liberal democracy. The states are now dealing with a coronavirus pandemic as well as other crises, such as the Turów mine dispute. These and other crises may have had a negative impact on the functioning of the V4 Group. What is the effectiveness of the alliance? What issues have the representatives of each state addressed in recent years? The cooperation has been established to promote European integration and now the countries faced issues within the European Union. And how do they support each other in their respective disputes? The proposed paper will answer these questions and discuss the role of this group in the Eastern European region through an extensive analysis over the last few years.	European Politics

In our experiment a random subset of party sup-porters are asked for their opinions on the importance of different topics either (i) in thecontext of improving electoral success of the campaign, or (ii) for them personally. We show that giving supporters more opportunities to voice their opinions increases their engagement in the campaign as measured using behavioral data from the party’s smartphone application. Survey data reveals that our voice treatments also increase other margins of campaign effort as well as perceived voice. The effects on campaign effort and perceived voice are driven by respondents asked to give their opinions in the context of improving the electoral campaign. Our evidence highlights that parties can increase their members’ investment in the democratic process by implementing policies that increase their voice.	Parties and Representation

While parties and movements may seek some of the same objectives, they usually diverge consiriably in their preferred tactics and aproaches to politics. Scotland provides an excellent case in point whether the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish independence movement each seek to promote the Scotland's separation from the United Kingdom. This paper examines new data collected as part of the 2021 Scottish Election Study to examine differences between movement activists and party activists in their attitudes and political behavior. Preliminary data analysis shows a close alignment between the two groups in their expressed national identities (epecially favoring ""Scottish"" over ""British"") but variance concerning their preferred routes to independence. Party activists register a greater approval of traditional, institutional channels, with movement activists leaning toward greater confrontation with state authorities. The results are informative to understanding both the nature of interest representation and to the politics of Scotland and the United Kingdom.	Parties and Representation

Despite this turmoil, the Republican Party remains asymmetrically polarized. We hypothesize that factional pressure from a far-right faction (the Tea Party) has exacerbated the party’s trends towards mass and elite polarization. We test this hypothesis through a granular analysis of Republican factionalism at the congressional district level. We develop a measure of local factionalism using novel datasets of factional activist presence and primary challenges. We implement a difference-in-differences design to assess whether local factionalism in the Tea Party period (2010—2014) heightened Republican partisanship and legislative extremism at the district level between 2008 (pre-treatment) and 2016 (post-treatment). We find that factional pressure did force congressional districts rightward on both measures. These findings clarify how the Tea Party captured the Republican Party and support a focus on the role of party factions in fomenting partisan conflict.	Parties and Representation

Parties’ positive position toward immigration is the first stipulation toward further actions on immigrant incorporation in parties. However, parties’ positions do not always translate into organizational actions. Using Brunsson’s (1989) neo-institutional theory on organizations, on a cross-national sample, this paper, will test the coherence of parties’ positions and parties’ actions on immigrant incorporation and assess the organizational behaviour parties have over the issue of immigrant political incorporation. Beyond general organizational characteristics, particular focus will be given on mechanisms that political parties use to promote immigrant incorporation in their organization. In particular, this paper will examine how the mechanisms parties use to include immigrants in their organizations (such as comities and working groups on diversity, minority quotas, candidates nomination procedure, recruitment), as well as organizational characteristics (such as candidate selection process, centralization in decision making, ideology), moderate the relation between parties' position on immigrant integration (organizational talk) and the number of elected representatives with immigrant background (organizational action). The analysis of party positions will be based on manifesto data from Parties’ Immigration and Integration Positions Dataset (PImPo), while the political parties organizational characteristics will be analysed using the Political Party Database Project.

Evidence for West European electorates from 1990-2017	439	While there is large agreement within the literature that West European policy spaces are well described by two latent dimensions, one socio-economic and one cultural conflict line, there is mixed evidence on the content of the latter. Following Riker’s (1982) work on heresthetics, we analyze situations in which shifts in the content of the cultural dimension really matter for political competition, such that they change the voter configuration.A multidimensional structure of voter preferences provides ‘windows of opportunities’ for issue entrepreneurs: If there are stable, well-structured dimensions which are uncorrelated with old conflict lines, there is room for parties to increase their vote share by strategically pushing the salience of that dimension. We formulate three conditions for such windows of opportunities: (1) an issue constitutes a conflict line, (2) the preferences on this conflict line are distinct from other salient conflict lines and (3) the conflict becomes politically relevant to voters.Based on Data from the European Values Study (1990-2019), factor analyses show that economic and moral issue preferences are well-structured in the West European electorate, while preferences on other cultural issues, such as gender, immigration, and environment, do not always constitute societal conflicts. However, if we detect an additional cultural conflict line, it is always sufficiently distinct from the moral conflict line. Salience parameters based on spatial vote choice models show if these conflict lines qualify for being exploited by issue entrepreneurs. We detect significant different patterns for Nordic, South and Central European countries over time.	Parties and Representation

An impressive number of studies show (1) that parties selectively emphasize issues on which they have a superior reputation; and (2) that voters’ issue priorities in large part decide their party support in elections. Scholars have engaged with parties issue competition, issue ownership and voters’ issue priorities in order to understand how issues decide elections. All of these studies assume that political parties’ selective issue emphasis influence voters’ issue priorities. Yet, strikingly, this fundamental assumption remains untested. We analyze party emphasis and voter priorities across 13 countries and 9 issues since 1970. We show that voters – regardless of their partisanship – indeed respond to the party system agenda. Yet, partisan sorting is widespread.	Parties and Representation

However, considering the preferences of individuals that will never vote for a given party downplay the accuracy of the given party's opportunities. Parties can potentially identify their opportunities by taking into account individuals that they may be able to convince. I propose a redefinition of the issue yield index based on the concept of potential party voters. I define them as individuals who do not vote yet for the party but express a higher probability to vote for the party than the mean probability to vote for all parties. In a nutshell, the concept allows identifying simply people that parties can convince. I hypothesize that the issue yield model using potential voters predicts better issue yield than the original model. I test this hypothesis by using the Issue Competition Comparative Project data. This framework has implications for the definition of the issue yield and improves the empirical model by taking into account a group of voters between the median and the partisan voter. Results show that, although the original issue yield model is relevant, the redefined model also predicts accurately parties' behavior. This paper challenges the hypothesis of a post-ideological area and enhances our understanding of party competition.	Parties and Representation

Radical left parties were able to use their anti-capitalist critique to gain votes from both Eurosceptic and pro-EU voters. Since then, how have radical left parties dealt with these very different groups of voters? This research looks at position blurring to understand if radical left parties can keep their diverse voter base by avoiding clarity on their EU integration policy position. To understand whether position blurring can contribute to the success of radical left parties, this research combines party and voter level data from the European Social Survey and Chapel Hill Expert Survey. The findings of this research show that when the electorate is largely in consensus on EU integration, radical left parties are more successful when presenting a clear position on EU integration. However, if the electorate is polarized on this issue, radical left parties can benefit from blurring their position. The broader implication of the findings is that position communication can be a crucial factor in determining voter’s choice.	Parties and Representation

This paper addresses this question by bridging the literature in environmental, security, and international law studies. It argues that, despite increasing perceptions of a rise in “precision warfare” thanks to technological innovations such as drones, in reality the destruction of the environment is very much still a considerable part of contemporary warfare. Gathering original evidence from recent inter-state conflicts, this paper demonstrates that, contrary to common wisdom, environmental destruction during war has become both more frequent and more pervasive rather in the past 20 years. The paper has important implications for our understanding of modern warfare. Studies of war and conflict have argued that wars have become less (Pinker 2011) or more (Braumoeller 2019) frequent, or that it has morphed completely in its forms (Fazal 2018). Yet, findings in this paper demonstrate that, while important, these changes should not distract us from the fact that, in important ways, conflict has not changed much. In other words, there are important facets of the war, such as its toll on the environment, that have not disappeared.	International Relations and Conflict

We map the emergence and diffusion of the new concept and compare it to the general visibility of climate change topics in the public debate.

Nonetheless, this one-sided narrative overlooks the consequential possibility that bad norms also diffuse in the meantime. This article asks how such reverse diffusion can happen in examining the contagious misreporting of emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). I argue that transgovernmental networks enable off-the-record information exchange and thus encourage countries to misreport their emission data––just like what others do––to establish an advantage in international climate negotiations. By applying a forensic analysis to over one million emission records submitted to the UNFCCC and spatial autoregressive regression, I find national governments are more likely to commit misreporting when they have more extensive network connections with those who also misreport. A mechanism analysis further rules out the race to the bottom as an alternative explanation. Through showing that in which way norm diffusion can undermine the functioning of one of the most salient international regimes, this article lends support to the claim that weak enforcement paralyzes global governance.

This paper takes a different perspective and focuses instead on the perceived salience of social conflict. Salience refers to the cognitive awareness of social conflict (e.g., perceived conflict between rich and poor). We argue that this relationship is asymmetric: individuals who perceive conflict to be salient, do not necessarily have to prefer one of the groups involved in the conflict, while individuals who hold strong outgroup attitudes are likely to perceive conflict as salient. Using data from the Netherlands from 2020, we show that perceptions of conflict are structured along two highly correlated dimensions: a socio-economic dimension and a cultural dimension. Moreover, we demonstrate that preference and salience of social conflict represents distinct aspects of an individual’s worldview and may have distinct electoral effects. Our findings illustrate the importance of conflict thinking in obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of social conflict.	Behaviour and Opinion

In multi-level systems, they often depend on subsidies from higher levels of government to finance investment spending. In this paper, we argue that the distribution of investment subsidies is often driven by political factors instead of equity or efficiency considerations. Concretely, we expect parties to engage in budgetary clientelism, meaning that higher-level politicians grant more investment subsidies to districts in which co-partisans govern than districts where this is not the case. We compiled a new dataset of investment subsidies to all German districts from 1995 to 2018 from the federal as well as the state governments and coded the partisanship of governments on all three levels. We then use matching techniques and difference-in-difference estimators to identify the causal effect of political alignment on the subsidies that districts receive. The results show that budgetary clientelism frequently occurs when state governments grant investment subsidies to districts, while no such practices exist for federal subsidies. This effect is strongly connected to the political election cycle, particularly strong in electorally contested districts and mainly a phenomenon of right-wing parties.	Political Institutions

Vogler	University of Konstanz	p	y	0206	Managing Social and Economic Externalities: How Industrialization Led to the Rise of the Bureaucratic State	1262	Externalities are a common aspect of complex social and economic systems. Human activity, particularly the activities of businesses, create externalities that are not a part of the economic calculation by business leaders. These externalities usually produce some form of social/political pressure from affected groups that request policy changes to address them. In this paper, I argue that the emergence of large-scale public bureaucracies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was an inevitable byproduct of the massive amplification of industrialization. As large parts of Europe and North America industrialized and experienced massive grows in overall economic wealth, significant externalities (such as environmental pollution and social problems resulting from population dislocation and rapid change) had to be addressed in some form. Public bureaucracies were required to effectively implement the policy responses that were demanded by the public. In short, I argue that externalities were a key driver of the rise of the modern bureaucratic state in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The emergence of the modern bureaucratic state had many further long-term implications for society, making this topic one of central relevance to political economists and scholars of externalities.

Scholars often link the dynamics of this hybridity to national characteristics, and explain the hybridity by each state’s specific institutional configurations. I conceptualize this hybridity with the help of three major empirical management patterns: old public administration (OPA), New Public Management (NPM), and post-NPM. Path dependence is the core idea analyzing the occurrence, persistence, and change of OPA, NPM, and post-NPM. By comparing China’s public reform with the OECD ones, I examine the similarities and differences of these hybrid practices in OPA, NPM, and post-NPM patterns. These differences of reforms and the dynamic of this hybridity are further analyzed with the help of path dependence idea. This idea underlines the historical-institutionalist impacts of older management patterns on new management elements. Specifically, the hybridity in China’s public reforms is more evident than the OECD ones due to a faster pace of socio-economic changes and a shorter time of reform actions.	Comparative Politics

Prior work shows that parties strategically manipulate the level of emotive language used in their campaigns based on their incumbency status, their policy position, and objective economic conditions. While the literature has demonstrated the important role that party characteristics and real-world conditions have in influencing campaign sentiment use, it has largely ignored the potential influence of non-political, individual-level attributes, such as gender. In line with a large literature on politics and gender, we argue that women candidates face strategic incentives to be more positive in their assessment of the world around them. We test this claim with a novel data set that captures the emotive language used in over 164,783 tweets posted by 2,662 candidates for elected office in the United Kingdom during the 2017 and 2019 elections. Consistent with prior literature, we find that candidates running from the ruling party use more positive sentiment than those running from the opposition party. Importantly, as we predicted, we also find that women candidates are more positive than their men counterparts – and that this positivity is even higher for incumbent women candidates than nonincumbents. Our analysis has important implications for research on gender and campaign strategies.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Recent studies, however, suggest that these gender differences are unlikely to be relevant later, once in elected office. This evidence is still not entirely clear when we focus on women in the top political position. To what extent the gender gap in political ambition persists in the front line of power? Based on data from an original survey administered to around 1,000 Spanish mayors, I provide the first thorough analysis of the attitudes and political ambitions of those who reach top positions. The findings reveal that, although there are gender differences in top politicians’ profiles, the gender gap on political ambition disappears among the political elite. This result is consistent taking into account other determinants of women's political selection such as age, educational level, or family responsibilities, among others. I further investigate mayors' patterns of re-election by combining these results with observational data on electoral candidacies. The similarities in political ambition do not equally promote the re-election of candidates in the following elections. The findings suggest that re-election patterns are skewed in favor of male politicians. The paper contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the underrepresentation of women in top political positions, focusing on women's motivations to reach and remain in positions of power.

Using the Comparative Campaign Dynamics Project data (Debus, Somer-Topcu, and Tavits 2018), I explore valence statements used by parties in elections, both personal and policy related, to ask if, and when, parties with woman leaders are more likely to use, and be targets of, strategic valence statements. Given previous research, I argue that the use of valence in electoral campaigns will be gendered in nature, with women party leaders more likely to experience valence attacks in campaigns but less likely to use valence in the same environment. I find there are many unexpected differences in the use of valence in campaigns that are associated with the gender of the party leader but these differences. Specifically, parties with women party leaders are less likely to use positive or neutral valence statements about themselves than parties led by men. In addition, parties led by women are also less likely to use valence statements against competitor parties and, surprisingly, that competitors are much less likely to use valence statements against parties with women leaders. The research highlights the gendered nature of campaign strategies that parties use with respect to valence and suggests future research on the consequences of the presence or absence of valence in campaigns for women.

While the literature has investigated the effect of ordinary female candidates on voters, it is less clear how the nomination of female leading candidates affects voters. We argue that the nomination of women as top candidates of political parties has important effects on voter attitudes and behavior due to the nationwide visibility of top party candidates. More specifically, we expect that the nomination of a female leading candidate has positive effects on the mobilization of female voters, their political efficacy, and increases the electoral support of the party among female voters. To test our theoretical argument, we conduct an unexpected events during survey design analysis exploiting the nomination of Annalena Baerbock by the German Green Party as the party’s top candidate in the 2021 federal election. This nomination provides a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of a female leading candidate nomination as it was entirely unclear whether Annalena Baerbock or the Greens’ male co-leader, Robert Habeck, would be nominated until the day of the official announcement. By leveraging a survey among more than 10,000 citizens that was in the field when Baerbock was nominated, we shed light on how her nomination affected voters.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Measuring the European public sphere	1230	Over the years, numerous scholars have attempted to gauge the degree to which national discourses about the European Union are connected. However, given problems in comparing discussions about a topic across different languages and media contexts, much of this work has focused on identifying whether the same issues are discussed at the same time, rather than the more important (but also much more difficult) question of whether they are discussed in the same way. In the past few years, new developments in machine learning and machine translation have, for the first time, made it possible to systematically compare the meanings of different texts across languages. I apply these latest innovations to an assessment of the European public sphere.Using a corpus of more than a million newspaper articles about the EU published in leading newspapers across the five largest European Union member states — Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain — I systematically assess both the key topics discussed and the framing of those topics when the media discuss the European Union. The results offer a better measure than has been available until now of the degree to which a European public sphere can be said to exist. In particular, they make clear that national discourses have become increasingly aligned over time, to the point that it now makes sense to talk about a European public sphere.

Voters' backlash on highly targeted campaign messages	401	Ever since the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, many observers assume that targeting is an effective campaign strategy. However, we know little about how voters react to targeted campaign messages. I argue that voters react positively to targeted messages at first, but once the targeting gets `too much', they recognize the strategy and punish parties for it. I tackle this question using a factorial survey experiment in Germany (N=3,200). I take a novel continuous approach to targeting by showing respondents campaign messages that differ in their targeting-degree. The results indeed show that there is a backlash effect of targeting. Voters react positively to messages targeted on one characteristic. However, targeting voters in a high degree, the success of a message decreases and is even significantly lower than not targeting at all. These results hold both for targeting the respondents implicitly or telling them explicitly that they are targeted using personal data. These results question the often-stated manipulation threat of targeting: voters seem to recognize and clearly punish parties that target them `too much'. These findings have important implications for modern election campaigning and its regulations.	Political Communication

Despite finding themselves at similar stages of sociopolitical development and EU integration, the two countries exhibit considerable differences in this regard. North Macedonia’s government has provided an unambiguously favourable portrayal of the EU, best summarised as “Eurofundamentalism”, where EUaccession is portrayed as a basic prerequisite for the prosperity of the country. By contrast, Serbia’s government has engaged in a “Euroopportunistic” representation of EU membership as a pragmatic policy goal whose desirability is subject to constant re-evaluation.Each of the two discourses is examined at three levels: (1) the creation of a symbolic façade of “Europeanness”; (2) the presentation of a timeframe for EU accession; (3) the portrayal of the importance of EU membership. Through its divergent findings between the two countries, The paper challenges the “stabilitocracy” paradigm of understanding the EU integration of the Western Balkans in a rather uniform and top-down fashion and points to the considerable discursive agency of national governments. It also posits that the two disparate governmental discourses might paradoxically produce a similar effect of undermining public knowledge about – and support for – the EU in both countries.

Thus, none of the countries that became ASEAN members in 1990th can be classified as democratic. Among them, Myanmar during the 24years of its membership has experienced a series of armed conflicts, revolution, and coup d’état alternated with attempts of liberalization. Using the corpus of the official newspaper of Myanmar’s government – The [Global] New Light of Myanmar (13521 articles for the period 03.1997-11.2021 where “ASEAN” appeared at least once), and working with the Quanteda package, the author seeks to answer the following questions: 1). what areas of the cooperation are mostly highlighted? 2). what countries are presented as the major partners? For this, three vocabularies on the main pillars of ASEAN cooperation (economic, security, and socio-cultural cooperation) were coded and based on the cosine proximity to them strategic partners were stated. After that, using the NLTK in Python author develops a tense comprehensive model and calculates the percentage of the past, present, and future forms for each vocabulary and partner country. The findings indicated the general increase of the socio-cultural vocabulary during the years of armed conflicts in its present tense form. While as the major economic partner was presented not any ASEAN member-country, but China with a strong tendency for future tense usage since 2015.	Political Communication

While higher flows of trade and capital have strengthened the web of interdependence between EU member countries (MCs), globalization and pandemic-related policymaking have unveiled governments’ latent tendencies to look internally to resolve certain policy matters while relying on EU institutions, international organizations (IOs), and external entities to resolve others. The dominant narrative on EU politics maintains that the EU has the capacity to shape the utility and policy choices of member- and candidate states’ governments in significant ways: mechanisms ranging from membership conditionality to monitoring policies, to fiscal deployments empower the EU to influence national policies while simultaneously regulating international policymaking. These explanations however do not fully explain variation in governments’ choices to internalize certain policy issues and internationalize others, particularly when we compare countries that share similar economic and institutional foundations. This approach does not fully explain, for instance, why EU countries---bounded by the same EU membership regulations--- responded to the pandemic by nationalizing education and health policy but internationalizing fiscal policies needed to mitigate the crisis to the level of the EU, IMF, the World Bank, and other IOs. In this article, I complement previous research on policy (inter)nationalization by emphasizing the role of domestic factors and external actors in shaping governments’ policymaking calculus. I empirically assess my argument on a data set comprising education and health policy indicators across the EU member- and candidate-countries prior and during the global health crisis.

This oversight is meant to focus solely on aggregate measures such as fiscal deficits, and it should be neutral with regard to the relative importance of the budgetary components. Yet, the policies resulting from oversight have been blamed for detrimental social outcomes, especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The composition of national budgets carries pervasive implications, for example, for growth and inequality. Against such a backdrop, limited attention has been devoted to the distributional implications of this oversight regime.Employing a panel of EU member countries from 1995 to 2018, we assess the extent of budgetary restructuring of public spending implemented by governments with fiscal positions noncomplying with the EU fiscal rules. Controlling for several political-economy determinants of changes of budgetary structure, our analysis uncovers substantial shifts in domestic budget compositions for countries under the Excessive Deficit Procedure within the Eurozone. This finding refutes both the presumed irrelevance of the oversight in shaping national spending and offers strong evidence of non-neutrality to budget structures as a result of powerful consolidation-driven pressures to reshape domestic spending.

While most scholars have focused on general support for the EU regime, studies of public support for specific EU policies suggest that voters’ attitudes towards the EU are diverse and multidimensional. However, we lack a theory to explain the variation in public support across different EU policy areas, although this has important implications for building domestic coalitions in favor of international cooperation. In this paper, I argue that citizens are driven by policy outcomes, and thus form an opinion on the basis of whether actions at the EU level will produce policies that are closer to their preferred policies than existing policy outcomes at the domestic level. Based on a new dataset that combines 26 Eurobarometer surveys from 1995 to 2011 with measures of policy positions for national and EU-level institutions, I leverage a within-respondent design to study variation in support for the supranational pooling of policy competences. Results confirm that domestic policy losers support the integration of policies for which the existing EU policy regime is closer to their preferred set of policies, especially in policy areas that they deem personally important. These findings link attitudes towards European integration to general theories about the centralization of power in multilevel systems and contribute to revive a rational-choice institutionalist approach to European integration.

Secondly, the paper moves to show the empirical analysis conducted until date seeking to prove that the political change observed in countries receiving a financial bailout was not only the consequence of the strict fiscal consolidation packages associated to this programme but also the consequence of a political learning that tookplace at the individual level. This empirical part of the article, the main one, uses three different types of analysis. First, the analysis uses country-level data to show how levels of citizens’ attitudes shifted differently according to the intensity of financial monitoring. This analysis is based on a series of diff-in-diff and synthetic control models. The second part of the empirical analysis uses individual data from the Sixth round of the European Social Survey as well as a case study of the UK.

A Joint Framework Analysing Telegram Protest Communication und Panel Survey Data	804	Societal crises give rise to societal instability and create fertile grounds for conspiratorial thinking. During the COVID19-pandemic, conspiracy beliefs seemingly affected the stability of the democratic order by fueling discontent with political elites. Social media accelerate the distribution of conspiracy narratives, and thereby, conspiracy beliefs (Lamberty & Rees, 2021), possibly fostering anti-elitism and norm-deviating political behaviour (Imhoff et al., 2020).However, the precise mechanism contributing to the growing discontent of certain societal groups is still unclear, and linking social media content effects to offline dynamics has proven challenging. Against the backdrop of these developments, we aim to address the link of conspiracy beliefs to anti-elitism by comparing longitudinal analyses of Telegram data and survey panel data. Explicitly, the paper aims to answer whether (a) the publicly discussed dynamics on Telegram are holding empirically and (b) the relationship found online is mirrored in society as a whole.To examine these questions, this study uses data on German Telegram protest communication in 2020/2021 since Telegram manifested as the most important platform for the distribution of COVID19-related conspiracy narratives (Hohlfeld et al., 2021). The results of this content analysis are contrasted with individual-level analyses based on a three-wave panel survey conducted in 2021 in Germany. By using comparable measurements of the key dimensions of conspiracy beliefs and anti-elitism, the results of the two studies can be interpreted in comparison. Finally, we exploit the longitudinal structure of both datasets to explore the direction of the effects of conspiracy beliefs on anti-elitism (and vice versa).	Political Communication

This research contributes to the framing theory and resonance processes, by systematically conceptualizing the dimensions of cultural resonance and moving the concept beyond its metaphor state. The goal is to provide an operational definition of cultural resonance for frame analyses. To identify what types of cultural devices (e.g., values or patterned ways of speaking) were used by political actors in the Covid-19 vaccination debate, 449 Facebook posts of main political parties, their leaders and governmental Facebook accounts from Germany and Romania were collected through Facepager. The vaccination debate (time to vaccine approval in EU and the debate following it: Dec 2020 – Jan 2021) was chosen since we can observe competing strategies of meaning-making only when interpretations of events are contested. Linguistic discourse analysis combined with membership categorization analysis provided a productive analytical strategy with suitable tools for capturing meaning beyond manifest textual elements - e.g., presuppositions that refer to the necessary assumptions for rendering a message meaningful. Preliminary results show two dimensions of cultural resonance: 1) the mainstream vs radical character of cultural devices, which refers to how widely shared and accepted a cultural value or symbol is with the respective cultural space; 2) the communication style which ranges from factual, objective discourse to figurative narratives.

It is clear that influential accounts play a bridging role in connecting the public and the government in times of crisis.Previous research has measured user influence during crises using the PageRank algorithm. However, few studies have investigated the persistence of influence during lengthy crises. Research on the COVID crisis in Germany showed news organizations’ and journalists’ accounts to have been influential in all phases of the crisis, while government accounts were particularly important shortly before and after the lockdown (Shahi et al., 2021). If governments can identify accounts with long-term influence, then collaborating with those accounts’ owners could help to build a more stable and responsive communication system. In contrast, cases where accounts exert only temporary influence could be due to the content of specific posts; analyzing the content of such posts might suggest ways of avoiding misinformation.This study aims to identify the continuity of influence of different categories of Japanese Twitter accounts during the early stage of COVID-19 (February to May, 2020). The categories and features of influential accounts were identified by retweet network analysis and text mining.Since Japan was legally unable to enforce a lockdown, citizens were asked to adopt “self-restraint” measures. The government’s ambiguous and uncertain response policies provoked public discontent and undermined trust in government policies and announcements. This makes the Japanese case particularly suitable for identifying influential accounts that exerted a lasting influence over the direction of public opinion.	Political Communication

Discussions on freedom focus on different aspects: the freedom of movement during a time of lockdowns, the freedom to access spaces without a digital green certificate, the freedom to make your own decision with respect to taking the vaccine and the freedom to freely express your views on COVID matters on social media. The proposed paper explores how the value of freedom has become contested on Instagram over the course of the pandemic. The study carries out a manual content analysis of images on Instagram in six European countries. It analyzes not only how salient the conflict over freedom is, but also the form that this conflict takes, meaning the way in which this conflict over freedom is represented visually and how it is portrayed symbolically.

This research contributes to the framing theory and resonance processes, by systematically conceptualizing the dimensions of cultural resonance and moving the concept beyond its metaphor state. The goal is to provide an operational definition of cultural resonance for frame analyses. To identify what types of cultural devices (e.g., values or patterned ways of speaking) were used by political actors in the Covid-19 vaccination debate, 449 Facebook posts of main political parties, their leaders and governmental Facebook accounts from Germany and Romania were collected through Facepager. The vaccination debate (time to vaccine approval in EU and the debate following it: Dec 2020 – Jan 2021) was chosen since we can observe competing strategies of meaning-making only when interpretations of events are contested. Linguistic discourse analysis combined with membership categorization analysis provided a productive analytical strategy with suitable tools for capturing meaning beyond manifest textual elements - e.g., presuppositions that refer to the necessary assumptions for rendering a message meaningful. Preliminary results show two dimensions of cultural resonance: 1) the mainstream vs radical character of cultural devices, which refers to how widely shared and accepted a cultural value or symbol is with the respective cultural space; 2) the communication style which ranges from factual, objective discourse to figurative narratives.

Elitism arises if and only if the office is attractive and the income difference between holding office, which gives a salary and outside income, and being a private citizen is sufficiently higher for high- than for low-income citizens. It can arise while holding office yields a higher income premium or facilitates more productive outside activities for low-income citizens. Restricting outside activities while in office prevents elitism, while adjusting legislator salaries may not.	Parties and Representation

Violent and dictatorial regimes could have long-lasting effects on the politics and repertoires of conflict in country.

We have created an original dataset that covers the violent political events at subnational level in Italy between 1969 and 1988. In our preliminary analyses of Italian provinces using count model regressions, we find that the membership of the fascist party in 1921 – hence before the institutionalization of the fascist regime - predicts the provincial number of political violence events more than forty years later.

Brandt	Uppsala University	p	y	0258	The Gendered Effects of UN Peacebuilding	1315	UN peace operations are increasingly focused not just on keeping the peace but also on building the peacebuilding capacity of communities (United Nations 2020). The literature on UN peace operations has largely overlooked their peacebuilding capacity; instead, focusing on the coercive security capacity of UN peacekeeping troops and their effect on violence reduction, or “negative peace.” Based on the findings from a quasi-experimental impact evaluation of US$ 44 million that the UN Peacebuilding Fund allocated to Burundi between 2007 and 2013, we demonstrate that UN peace operations build community-level peacebuilding capacity, contributing to “positive peace.” We also show that this peacebuilding capacity affects men and women differently. Our study, which combining a large household level survey with almost 200 semi-structured interviews, demonstrates that UN peacebuilding efforts particularly increase the capacity of women to mediate conflict in their communities. At the same time, in areas where the UN is engaged in community-level peacebuilding, men report a decreased level of confidence in women’s decision-making and increased levels of discrimination against men, pointing to backlash that often accompanies gender-focused empowerment. These findings have implications for the literature on UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding, identifying the peacebuilding effects of UN peace operations while pointing to the complex gender dynamics of community-based peacebuilding efforts.

Yet, we know little about the consequences of the Allied powers' violence. While military casualties can be associated with conflict dynamics, we argue that Allies' aerial strikes over civilian populations may have pivoted post-war political identities. Social identity theory would predict such relatively indiscriminate episodes of violence to trigger an anti-perpetrator bias that may transcend to conflict sides. Drawing on directional and discounting models of issue voting, one could expect such violence to increase support for communist parties in the aftermath of the conflict. We test this argument by delving into the consequences of WWII in Italy, where the Allies bombed one-fifth of Italian municipalities, being 75% of these aerial strikes executed by the US Army. We resource to data providing the location of Allies' strikes to use a difference-in-differences setup that compares communist parties' vote-shares in municipalities that received US aerial strikes to those which did not experience such a type of violence before and after the conflict. Preliminary findings suggest that American strikes increased support for the Italian Communist Party in elections held after WWII. Such increase is particularly notable when looking at strikes that likely affected civilians instead of purely military targets. We believe these findings relate American operations in the context of the European theatre of WWII to the political dynamics of the Cold War in this region.	International Relations and Conflict

Especially, thedistinction among acts of one-sided violence between targeted andnon-targeted ones has been theorized to affect individualsdifferently. While one-sided violence is expected to reduceinterpersonal trust and trust in governmental institution moregenerally, targeted one-sided violence should be even moredetrimental, especially if carried out by government actors. Drawingon a large set of surveys and information on perpetrators and targetsof one-sided violence we assess these expected effects empirically,drawing on variation both across time and space. Our results are in line with the hitherto largely anecdotal findings thattargeted one-sided violence has nefarious consequences, well beyondthose of violence more generally.

Drawing on directional and discounting models of issue voting, one could expect such violence to increase support for communist parties in the aftermath of the conflict. We test this argument by delving into the consequences of WWII in Italy, where the Allies bombed one-fifth of Italian municipalities, being 75% of these aerial strikes executed by the US Army. We resource to data providing the location of Allies' strikes to use a difference-in-differences setup that compares communist parties' vote-shares in municipalities that received US aerial strikes to those which did not experience such a type of violence before and after the conflict. Preliminary findings suggest that American strikes increased support for the Italian Communist Party in elections held after WWII. Such increase is particularly notable when looking at strikes that likely affected civilians instead of purely military targets. We believe these findings relate American operations in the context of the European theatre of WWII to the political dynamics of the Cold War in this region.	International Relations and Conflict

Especially, thedistinction among acts of one-sided violence between targeted andnon-targeted ones has been theorized to affect individualsdifferently. While one-sided violence is expected to reduceinterpersonal trust and trust in governmental institution moregenerally, targeted one-sided violence should be even moredetrimental, especially if carried out by government actors. Drawingon a large set of surveys and information on perpetrators and targetsof one-sided violence we assess these expected effects empirically,drawing on variation both across time and space. Our results are in line with the hitherto largely anecdotal findings thattargeted one-sided violence has nefarious consequences, well beyondthose of violence more generally.

The legacy of Fascism on Political Violence in Italy 1969-1988	1103	Did the fascist experience in Italy affect political violence during the first years of the democratic republic? And can the local experience of the Fascist regime explain variation of violent events during the so-called Years of Lead (1969-1988) within Italy? Violent and dictatorial regimes could have long-lasting effects on the politics and repertoires of conflict in country. Even after several years of their collapse, however, we still need to understand how these legacies can affect patterns of political violence. We have created an original dataset that covers the violent political events at subnational level in Italy between 1969 and 1988. In our preliminary analyses of Italian provinces using count model regressions, we find that the membership of the fascist party in 1921 – hence before the institutionalization of the fascist regime - predicts the provincial number of political violence events more than forty years later. And especially neofascist violence during the Years of Lead.	International Relations and Conflict

The literature on UN peace operations has largely overlooked their peacebuilding capacity; instead, focusing on the coercive security capacity of UN peacekeeping troops and their effect on violence reduction, or “negative peace.” Based on the findings from a quasi-experimental impact evaluation of US$ 44 million that the UN Peacebuilding Fund allocated to Burundi between 2007 and 2013, we demonstrate that UN peace operations build community-level peacebuilding capacity, contributing to “positive peace.” We also show that this peacebuilding capacity affects men and women differently. Our study, which combining a large household level survey with almost 200 semi-structured interviews, demonstrates that UN peacebuilding efforts particularly increase the capacity of women to mediate conflict in their communities. At the same time, in areas where the UN is engaged in community-level peacebuilding, men report a decreased level of confidence in women’s decision-making and increased levels of discrimination against men, pointing to backlash that often accompanies gender-focused empowerment. These findings have implications for the literature on UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding, identifying the peacebuilding effects of UN peace operations while pointing to the complex gender dynamics of community-based peacebuilding efforts.

However, minority accommodation often sparks backlashes from the ethnic majority. The anti-minority violence perpetrated by India's Hindutva movement and Rwanda's former Hutu Power movement are only the most drastic examples. Yet, in light of its documented pacifying effects and material benefits, widespread resistance against even symbolic accommodation is puzzling. In this article, I address this puzzle, focusing on majority grievances and threat perceptions. As regards institutional form, I argue that majority backlashes are more likely where minority accommodation is based on explicitly ethnic criteria. Thereby, it visibly deviates from norms of majority rule and activates injustice frames. As regards societal context, I argue that majority backlashes are more likely where accommodation targets minorities with a history of civil conflict and where it is implemented during phases of regime transition. Under such circumstances, it risks sparking especially pronounced perceptions of threat. To test these arguments, I introduce new monthly data on proposed and implemented minority accommodation, majority affirmation in state constitutions, and ethno-cultural majority mobilization. I use these data to conduct a quantitative analysis covering all multi-ethnic states since the end of the Cold War. I complement this with process tracing in several purposefully-chosen typical cases. My findings highlight the difficult trade-offs facing policy-makers in divided states, who may be caught between opposing demands of ethnic majority and minorities. Moreover, they underline the importance of incorporating majority nationalist mobilization into conflict research more broadly.	International Relations and Conflict

In spite of this question's critical importance, there remains fundamental disagreement on the identity-related consequences of power-sharing. Drawing on social psychology, I identify three mechanisms which connect power-sharing with the salience of ethnic boundaries and their politicization. First, power-sharing reduces the congruence between ethnic identities and political status attainments. Thereby, it decreases the value of ethnic boundaries both for individuals' cognitive uncertainty reduction and for elite mobilization. Second, however, specifically corporate power-sharing institutions enhance the cognitive accessibility of ethnic boundaries. Thereby, they conversely increase their salience and elite incentives to emphasize them. Finally, if adopted in the immediate wake of civil conflict, power-sharing helps alleviate identity threats faced by members of previously marginalized groups. Thereby, it sharply reduces ethnic salience in the short-term. I examine these expectations at both the individual and group levels. First, I use mass survey data comprising 149'000 minority respondents from 97 countries to investigate the consequences of power-sharing for ethnic identification. I construct a series of hierarchical multi-level models that exploit both between- and within-group variation. Second, I use new data on ethnic organizations' electoral performance on both the national and subnational levels to examine the consequences of power-sharing for elites' politicization of ethnic boundaries. Together, the results from these analyses highlight the heterogeneous identity-related consequences of power-sharing, depending on its institutional type and ethno-political context in which it is adapted. Thereby, the findings illuminate not only how power-sharing affects ethnic divisions, but also the mechanisms connecting them.	International Relations and Conflict

However, there remain a number of significant challenges with the existing evidence base, including the durability of these effects, the effectiveness of contact between ethnic groups in post-conflict contexts, and how easily we can generalize from experimental settings to real-world.

The analysis provides further support to a growing literature highlighting the potential limits of intergroup contact. Whilst we find some long-lasting positive effects on important measures of social life, there are no discernible effects on attitudes towards personal relationships, and more surprisingly, no positive impact on political attitudes. This suggests that intergroup contact can have an important impact on social attitudes, softening attitudes and breaking down barriers in social life, however, there are clearly also significant limits of intergroup contact on political and personal attitudes in fraught post-conflict setting such as Northern Ireland.

However, it is not clear whether sanctioned countries would necessarily reduce their military expenditure in relative terms. We argue that in the short run channeling proportionally more resources to the military can both boost target states' bargaining leverage against foreign adversaries and consolidate their domestic political power. We further argue this impact is moderated by two additional factors: a country's economic integration into the global import networks of strategic commodities and its regime type. Countries that are better integrated have smaller pressure to spend; less integrated countries, in contrast, have stronger incentives to purchase and stock weapons and strategic resources while they can. Meanwhile, democratic targets are more constrained in reallocating resources to the military since they rely more on the provision of public goods. Applying dynamic panel modeling, we find strong support that sanction shocks can result in a higher portion of military spending in the short run, particularly for less integrated countries. This effect dissipates as states become sufficiently integrated and as sanctions prolong. However, we do not find significant differences between democratic and autocratic targets.

Moving beyond the trade destruction effect of sanctions discussed in previous literature, this paper focuses on the effects on third parties and potential beneficiaries, which is often overlooked in existing research. By disconnecting economies, sanctions create opportunities for third parties to step in. But can this nullify other efforts, e. g. if the third party is (another) autocratic state? Do economic restrictions and outside pressure thus ‘push’ autocratic regimes closer together? This paper hypothesizes that China deepened its politico-economic ties with Russia in response to the sanctions imposed by the EU and the US and might thus benefit from the disconnect between the economies of Russia and the EU and the US. Using a gravity model approach with random and fixed effects specifications, this paper presents evidence that a negative trade diversion effect at the beginning of the sanctioning period turns positive after a few years, especially with China . Besides evidence on the product level of sanctioned products, the reorientation of trade flows can also be observed on more aggregate levels of measurement. In sum, the findings emphasize the need to evaluate potential unintended effects of policies on third parties in general while economic sanctions may run counter to long-term strategic and foreign policy goals.

Nor has any study analysed when and why third-party countermeasures against secondary sanctions are effective. I use the 2018 reinstatement of secondary sanctions on Iran as a natural experiment to identify the impact of secondary sanctions on exports by third countries to a target. The empirical approach is a Differences-in-Differences-Specification using monthly self-reported export data from 70 countries to Iran between 2015 and 2019. The results show that the secondary sanctions decreased exports of 27 countries by, on average, 75 percent of their 2017 levels. Further, I develop a theoretical argument that third countries' countermeasures on the firm level, such as blocking mechanisms or financial circumvention institutions, will be ineffective. The threat by the sender of secondary sanctions is credible in comparison to the threat by a third country to target its firms. Therefore, any countermeasure must use diplomatic or economic actions at the state level to be effective. I test the argument against case studies of third-country countermeasures against secondary sanctions, including an evaluation of the ability of European Countermeasures to mitigate the effect of the 2018 Iranian secondary sanction reinstatement. Consistent with the argument, European Countermeasures were ineffective. The findings have important implications for the use and design of secondary sanctions and related countermeasures.

Higher values in our measure indicate that the mention more closely resembles contexts used when portraying immigrants, rather than natives.At the end of this process, we use this outcome measure to analyse the dynamic response of local perceptions of ethnic hierarchies to shifts in immigrant exposure. In particular, we causally estimate the effect of an increase of an immigrant group size on distance towards that group, as well as second-order effects on local attitudes towards other immigrant groups.

Less attention has been given to factors in home countries that may affect migrants’ eventual circumstances. This study examines how the information labor migrants gain in their home countries while looking for overseas jobs affects their migration process and outcome. We conduct a digital field experiment in a high out-migration city in Pakistan, the second largest supplier of temporary low-skilled labor migrants to the Gulf Cooperation Council states. Our information treatments are administered via a phone app, which is not only a low-cost and accessible way to share information with individuals but also allows us to collect outcome data from our respondents at several points in time. Specifically, the treatments provide objective and accurate information to respondents about modal job contracts and about the best-performing job recruiters in their neighborhoods. Together, our research design and treatments allow us to analyze several outcomes of interest, including whether the provision of information leads migrants to have an easier time navigating the process of getting a job, get better job contracts, work with higher quality agents and be more satisfied with the migration experience. Overall, our project allows us to empirically evaluate an important common assumption that if low-skilled migrants simply “knew more” – that is, had more relevant and accurate information - they would not allow themselves to have negative migration trajectories and outcomes.

One set of arguments posits that the migration process transforms emigrants’ political views and preferences through exposure to more consolidated democratic institutions in the countries of residence. An alternative perspective argues that emigrant electorates display similar political preferences to home country electorates because their main political socialization take place prior to departure and/or mirror comparable socio-economic differences, which in turn constitute the basis of their vote choice also in their homeland. Drawing on an extensive novel dataset of emigrant votes per country of residence in more than 100 homeland elections worldwide, we estimate pairwise fixed effects regressions to show that political distance, defined as the difference in POLITY scores between the countries of origin and residence, is related to systematic differences between the emigrant and homeland vote. This result is largely driven by migrants moving to countries with higher democracy scores. We provide further evidence that the mechanism underlying this result is political socialization, where emigrants (1) coming from less democratic origin countries and (2) staying longer in the residence country are more likely to be interested in political issues.

Higher values in our measure indicate that the mention more closely resembles contexts used when portraying immigrants, rather than natives.At the end of this process, we use this outcome measure to analyse the dynamic response of local perceptions of ethnic hierarchies to shifts in immigrant exposure. In particular, we causally estimate the effect of an increase of an immigrant group size on distance towards that group, as well as second-order effects on local attitudes towards other immigrant groups.

Region-wide surveys indicate that around 80% of Africans who aspire to migrate cite economic reasons as their primary motivations (Afrobarometer 2019). What is less clearly defined is whether development interventions aimed at providing employment opportunities can influence migratory decisions. On the one hand, such programs are expected to reduce key push factors that drive young people to live and work abroad. On the other hand, there is evidence that with employment opportunities arise new ambitions and additional resources that make young people more willing and able to move abroad. We assess the impact of a youth employment intervention by the International Organization for Migration (the IOM) through a randomized-controlled trial. The IOM Youth Training Program aimed to improve the economic self-sufficiency of young entrepreneurs/early start-ups in The Gambia, and consequently, shape their migration decisions. We examine the short- and long-term effects of the program on the aspiration to migrate, the perceived ability to migrate, and the willingness to consider unauthorized channels.	Political Economy

We consider this framework is limited because it assumes that losses and gains affect party's decision-making process in a comparable way, and because it assumes that the decision-making process of clientelist political parties focuses only on absolute levels of utilities while overlooking changes in outcomes respect to a reference point. We hypothesize that parties are risk averse in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of losses---i.e., losing an election hurts more than winning an election pleases. This explains why clientelism is most likely when parties are probable winners or have experienced important losses in the past. After formalizing a theory of vote buying and vote selling within the expected utility theory, we tested it in the lab by designing an economic experiment. Exploiting these novel experimental data, we show that prospect theory provides a better explanation of clientelism than do other theories based on the expected-utility theory.	Political Economy

This study argues that the selection rule, which defines the accountability paths for local officials, can significantly impact the specifics of budget allocation. Using originally collected information on approximately nine million city-level public procurement contracts in Russia, I explore mayors' choices in budget allocation by looking at what types of goods they purchase. Each contract provides a description of goods that are procured. I utilize these contract descriptions to classify the type of goods that are obtained: infrastructural (for instance, construction contracts) or social (for instance, provision of commodities for educational and medical facilities). I use a set of contracts that were financed by the city-level budgets and apply structural topic modeling to identify the types of goods which local budgets are most likely to fund. This allows me to characterize differences in budget allocation preferences and explore how these differences can be explained by institutional features of cities and by individual mayors' characteristics. The paper predicts that the local mayors’ selection rule can affect the type of goods on which local officials spend budget resources. It also suggests that the main effects are explained by local officials’ career concerns mechanism.	Political Economy

We examine this question both theoretically and empirically. We develop an accountability model between an elected politician and a bureaucrat in which an election occurs after the first period, introducing possible turnover of the incumbent politician. In this framework, entrenchment refers to the probability that the incumbent wins the election to stay in power into the second period. We derive two predictions that we test empirically. First, as the incumbent's entrenchment increases, the bureaucrat exerts more effort, improving performance. Second, the entrenchment of the incumbent has a non-monotonic effect on selection of high quality bureaucrats. We test these implications in the context of Brazilian municipal government. We measure entrenchment in terms of the strength of political dynasties in municipal administration. We then use school performance data and rich personnel data on school administrators and teachers to measure bureaucratic performance and quality, respectively, to test these predictions. Our study provides insights into the dynamic effects of political turnover on public goods provision and bureaucratic quality.	Political Economy

Yet, outsourcing also offers opportunities to circumvent employment regulations in the public sector. The praised flexibility private contractors have to hire employees can also be used to hire political supporters. I call the use of outsourcing for mobilization purposes patronage contracting. Exploiting close-elections regression discontinuities across Brazilian municipalities, I show that opportunistic mayors who engage in clientelistic practices outsource not only service delivery but also patronage jobs. Moreover, I demonstrate that this effect is driven by municipalities where mayors are pressured by stronger political machines. Pre-registered survey experiments with mayoral candidates confirm these findings. This study presents a cautionary tale against the common assertion that outsourced services provide fewer opportunities for malfeasance: the private sector delivery of public services does not necessarily isolate service provision—and the jobs associated with it—from political capture.

The role of occupational specific skills on preferences for redistribution	1206	Different strands in social sciences have analyzed the role of specific skills on distinct political stances, however, a consensus has not been reached yet. On the one hand, sociologists stress that workers with specific skills are less replaceable so they tend to face a lower probability of job loss. On the other hand, political scientists argue that specific skills are less transferable than general skills and therefore, they are associated with worse consequences in case of job loss. For this reason, there is not an agreement about the effect of specific skills on redistribution preferences. In the current paper I urge for the need to distinguish between firm- and occupation-specific skills. Following labor economics literature, I stress that occupation-specific skills (OSS) are more relevant than firm-specific skills (FSS) in shaping labor market prospects and that a new theory is required. The main difference outlined is that, contrary to FSS, occupational context -concretely occupational unemployment rates (OUR)- moderates the effects of OSS. With high OUR workers with high levels of OSS have low transferability of skills and at the same time their repleaceability is high. On the contrary, when OUR is low, OSS is associated with high transferability of skills and low repleaceability. I provide a simple and tractable model that grasps different relations between OSS and redistribution preferences. To show the relevance of this distinction I use the European Social Survey to study redistribution preferences with the insights of this theoretical framework. Moreover, I discuss different OSS measures.	Behaviour and Opinion

And, does this matter for their Survival?	632	This article analyzes the political careers of party leaders in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland for the postwar period (1945-2020). Incorporating previous research on political careers in general and careers-as-sequences literature in particular, it provides a fine-grained overview of party leaders' political careers that takes executive, legislative and party positions into account. Aside from displaying these careers descriptively, I also look to what extent party leaders benefit from career capital. The latter concept is a one-dimensional aggregation of pre-party leaders' political careers and indicates to what extent a politician spent more time in positions with more seniority across dimensions. Theoretically, I hypothesise that career capital serves as an indication for political networks, experience and reputation, and therefore increases the probability of party leaders' political survival. In addition, I also examine the potential impact of youth wing positions, more specifically, as they carry the implication of early-mover advantages. The empirical section consists of survival models that are used to analyze these propositions. The results are in line with the expectations. Career capital aides party leaders' survival in office, but it only does so when one takes party characteristics, electoral performance and country into account. Youth wing positions, however, seem to have strong benefits that go beyond party and country, and party leaders who have had experience in their party's youth wing last significantly longer in office.

Political Experience and Rhetorical Complexity	569	Across Europe, populist political movements have recently had considerable electoral success, in part based on portrayals of political elites as 'out of touch' with ordinary voters. These portrayals are often nourished by establishment politicians using overly complex rhetoric. Conversely, populist politicians often use simple rhetoric to signal commonality with voters. However, little is known about the causes and consequences of varying rhetorical complexity among elected officials. I argue that a plausible driver of variation in this dimension of political rhetoric is the nature and extent of political experience: as politicians amass legislative and governing experience, their language increasingly mimics the technical vocabulary of the legislative process. By implication, politicians' rhetoric becomes increasingly complex over over the course of a career. I test this implication in the context of the Danish parliament, from which I combine rich data on individual legislator careers with the complete record of legislative speech across three decades. Using a combination of established and novel measures of rhetorical complexity, I then characterize the trajectory of rhetorical complexity over the course of a legislative career. The results add to our understanding of the drivers of mass grievances fueling populist political movements.	Legislative Studies

Islamist parties often employ patriarchal gender ideology that can discourage women from seeking political office. Yet, many Islamist parties have also successfully mobilized women in their cadres. In this paper, we argue that the influence of Islamist parties on women’s political rep- resentation is not uniform but differs for secular and pious women. While the incumbency of Islamist political parties can discourage secular women from seeking political office, it does not necessarily have the same effect on pious women. Thus, Islamist parties negatively influence emergence of secular female political candidates but do not pious female political candidates. To illustrate this dynamic, we examine how local level incumbency of an Islamist political party influences gender composition of candidates running for office in local elec- tions in Turkey. Between 2009-2014 the pro-Islamist AKP gained electoral victories in many municipal districts. We exploit sub-national level variation in AKP’s local incumbency to examine its impact on emergence of female municipal council candidates. Using a regression discontinuity design we show that AKP incumbency leads to fewer women running for polit- ical office. However, this effect is largely evident for women running for office under secular political parties. AKP incumbency does not negatively influence emergence of women running for office under religiously conservative parties.	Comparative Politics

In order to reconcile these paradoxes, this paper advances the argument that the relationship between redistribution support and cash transfer preferences is conditional on the subjective efficiency of the policy design. Empirically, this paper draws on data from an original survey and experimental data from Finland and Spain. Results give credit to our argument, albeit with important differences across context. In Spain, support for UBI is predicted by its perceived redistributive efficiency, more so than in Finland, where individuals are less polarized over universality. On the contrary, individuals in more residual welfare states show consistently higher support for policies they perceive as more redistributive, and universality is indeed a contentious dimension even for pro-redistribution individuals. These results have far-reaching implications for the study of welfare preferences and the politics of universal basic income.	Behaviour and Opinion

Individual-level determinants of support for universal basic income	1301	Universal basic income is becoming a prominent alternative in the reform of the welfare state, yet its political support remains a puzzle. Existing research shows that particular groups are more likely to support this policy alternative than others. The low-income, unemployed, youth, and left-wing have been found to be especially supportive. Yet, current work fails to show whether these individuals actually prefer a UBI over means-tested alternatives and why this is the case. This paper fills this research gap by employing a conjoint experiment, that enables to discern the impact of policy design on support, and of uncovering which policy alternatives are preferred by different groups. Results show that material variables are not determinant in defining UBI support. However, in line with previous work, left-wing individuals do give consistently higher support rates to a UBI policy design than those on the right. Despite this, findings also unveil that the left-wing still prefer means-tested schemes over universal and unconditional ones. This suggests that previous research has over-stated support for UBI. Findings are also suggestive that other variables aside from ideology and material indicators may play an important role in determining UBI support. In this sense, future work may explore the role of perceptions in mediating support for UBI.	Behaviour and Opinion

Evidence from mayoral and general elections in Brazil	751	Political theorists and enthusiasts of basic income advocate that an unconditional, periodic, and nonwithdrawable cash payment can encourage voter turnout by freeing up time, energy, and the cognitive bandwidth of citizens. This paper provides the first quantitative assessment of this argument by studying Renda Básica de Cidadania (RBC) - currently the largest basic income program in Latin America. Since 2013 RBC has paid a monthly transfer equivalent to 15% of the Brazilian minimum wage to 42,000 (25%) of the individuals living in Maricá, located in Rio de Janeiro. Estimates from a difference-in-differences design show a substantive and statistically significant increase in voter turnout in Maricá. In addition, RBC reduced the share of votes typically caused by voters' lack of knowledge about candidates (blank votes) or dissatisfaction with the quality of candidates running for office (null votes). These effects appear in local and general elections and are robust across different models.	Behaviour and Opinion

Meanwhile, the role of “hunches” is often lauded as a necessary guiding mechanism for interpretive scholars. This paper explores the role of intuition and argues for acknowledging, recognizing and legitimizing its role across methodological and epistemic divides. In particular, the paper shows how intuition plays an important role in 1) logics of research (inductive, deductive or abductive), 2) case selection, and 3) exploring causal mechanisms. On the one hand, the paper discusses how deductive logics are positioned in a hierarchy of superiority that incentives and prioritizes deductive work. One the other hand, such incentives are untransparent and shoe horn work that might not really be deductive into such a framework. Meanwhile scholars are prevented from using intuition to shift approach and adopt a more abductive/iterative approach when deductive work fails or falls short analytically. In other words, this paper argues for an empowered methodological approach to using intuition to make important research decisions, rather than be ashamed of or shy away from its role. Overall, the paper addresses how recognizing and legitimizing the role of intuition aligns with endeavours for encouraging more transparency and “reflexive openness” in political science.

This paper answers this question by considering the role of visuality within political science research. In describing a new type of mapping—cognitive mapping—which directly brings in participants’ perspectives and viewpoints to map their spatial realities, the project posits the value of visualising space as an additional layer of political analysis, particularly as a means through which we are better able to realise the topics, occurrences, and people that we study. The paper demonstrates the value of visual methods by showing cognitive mapping in practice in Ukraine as a way to uncover citizens’ preferences and opinions around territory and geography. In doing so, the project reveals the value of visual methods, and especially participatory methods like cognitive mapping, as a way for the people living the sociopolitical phenomena under study to share their perspectives, opinions, and viewpoints. Whereas knowledge acquired through lived experience is often granted less legitimacy in the academy because of its close connection to and association with participants, their experiential knowledge can deepen our analyses, including at other spatial scales, and thus shed light on underexplored phenomena.

Clarifying the confusion about models for categorical dependent variables	1048	Models for categorical dependent variables, such as turnout, party choice, or partisanship have eluded scholars for decades. Should the coefficients be reported and interpreted or are marginal effects preferable? Can interaction effects be statistical significant even without of product terms? How make sense of multinomial logit models, if their coefficients depend on the choice of the baseline category? There are several papers concerned with such questions, but not all of them can help with researchers' confusion about how to apply and interpret results of these models. Yet much of this confusion about models for categorical dependent variables can be avoided by not asking too much of them and by keeping in mind the distinction between model specification, model parameters, and quantities of interest.The paper points out that certain aspects of linear regression cannot be generalised without getting into the trouble of paradoxes and ambiguities. Firstly, it shows how identifying causal effects with differences in means leads to paradoxes while marginal effects do not globally describe the properties of a statistical model for categorical dependent variables. Secondly, it shows that the dependence of coefficients on the choice of a baseline category is not a problem unique to multinomial logit models, but also concerns linear regression models with categorical independent variables. Third, it discusses well-established techniques of statistical inference that allow to deal with this situation without incurring ambiguities. Based on this discussion, the paper derives a set of guidelines for sound inference about generalised linear and related models.	Political Methodology

Evidence from Eurobarometer Survey Data	656	Citizens’ opinion representation is a vital feature of democratic regimes. The European Union has been growing in relevance and spans over a large number of countries. Who does the European Union represent? By using the Eurobarometer surveys and a policy implementation dataset, I show that women and older people are less represented by the European Union policy. In particular, women are 5.4% more likely than men to express a majority opinion that does not receive policy representation. I show that women’s representation deficit comes from the the European Union failing to implement majority desired policy changes, especially in gendered-related areas such as consumer and environmental protection. For older people, instead, the differential representation is concentrated almost exclusively on disagreement over the European Union enlargement. Additionally, I show that the patterns of representation are compatible with unequal group engagement, but only for the gender bias. Young people receive a representation bonus even though they are less engaged with the European Union.	European Politics

Recent studies show that the EU’s policy choices have become politized in member states (Hagemann et al., 2017). Eager to avoid voters' punishment for unpopular decisions, European governments signal responsiveness to domestic electorates during negotiations in Brussels (Schneider, 2018). In contrast to the existing literature, this paper argues that EU decisions do not merely respond to public opinion. Instead, they also shape how European publics think about electorally salient policies. Specifically, the EU's adoption of a policy increases popular support for that policy. Elite cue theory leads me to expect that this effect only materializes among members of the public who trust the EU. Moreover, the adoption of a policy by a unanimous Council of the EU conveys a qualitatively different cue to the public than the Council's endorsement of the same policy despite vocal dissent, and the latter should lead to a smaller rally in support of the policy than the former. Survey experiments administered to large national samples in Germany and Austria find support for the argument that publics respond to signals conveyed from Brussels. Cues about Covid-19 economic recovery aid and refugee redistribution increase German and Austrian respondents' support of these policies by 3-7 percentage points. As expected, this average effect is driven by the much larger effect on the subset of respondents who trust the EU. Unanimous decisions trigger a bigger rally in public support than policy choices over which Council members are divided.	European Politics

Previous literature on the opinion-policy nexus in the EU mostly relies on a single measure of public opinion: public support for EU membership. However, I argue that distinguishing different types of public support for European integration – regime support (i.e. support for EU membership) and policy support (i.e. support for specific EU policies) – is needed to provide a more nuanced answer to the impacts of public support on government decision-making, since regime support and policy support do not necessarily go in sync with each other. In addition, the domestic institutional/electoral factors that can possibly mediate the mass-elite linkages on the European stage have been under-examined. By conducting a logistic regression analysis including all member states of the EU between 1999 and 2021 using Eurobarometer survey and VoteWatch Europe data, I propose that policy support has a stronger effect on government vote decisions in the Council than regime support, hence more explanatory power. When the public's policy support decreases, national governments will cast more opposition votes in the Council in the corresponding policy area. I also argue that the domestic electoral/institutional context of each member state, including electoral systems, multipartism, government composition, EU issue salience, and domestic electoral uncertainty, mediates the opinion-policy nexus in the Council. This research contributes to broadening our understanding of dynamic issue responsiveness in supranational decision-making.	European Politics

However, little is known about whether similar biases characterize supranational policymaking in the European Union (EU) and, if so, under which conditions EU policymaking responds unequally to the preferences of different types of stakeholders (which can be organized interests or the public at large). This paper explores these questions by analyzing an original data set of 43 legislative proposals for which the European Commission (EC) organized an open public consultation among stakeholders prior to the formulation of the respective proposal. The data set reports for each policy alternative included in one of the public consultation surveys (i) the level of support different stakeholder types expressed for the policy alternative and (ii) whether the policy alternative was included by the EC in their legislative proposal. The results of the analysis show whether and to what extent EC policymaking is unequally responsive to different stakeholders as well as the conditions under which unequal policy responsiveness may arise. These results are relevant to both researchers and practitioners since the EC has established one of the most comprehensive open public consultation regimes, with the aim to increase its input and output legitimacy by giving interested stakeholders greater opportunity to voice their preferences at relatively low cost in the policymaking process.

However, it is unclear how exactly national political elites can extract money from corporate endeavors they do not directly control. Importantly, most members of the political elite are not directly involved in legislative or parliamentary committee affairs with regulatory authority over the natural resource industry and cannot leverage such positions.In this paper, we identify the political elite as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and show that PEPs respond to natural resource discoveries and corresponding FDI inflows by establishing their own firms as vehicles for extracting money from the multinational corporations that invest in the natural resource industry. However, different factions of PEPs benefit differently from establishing corporate connections with multinationals, implying that the inflow of resources leads to a reconfiguration of wealth between competing elite groups. The study of how elites use their political offices to extract rents from natural resources – and how they distribute those rents between competing elite factions – is hampered by the fact that natural resource rents are not randomly distributed. We circumvent this problem by marshalling evidence from the case of Mozambique, which experienced a sudden and unexpected surge in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) after 2009, spurred by discovery of large reserves of natural gas.

The Colonial Design of Administrative Units in Sub-Saharan Africa	987	The design of subnational administrative units shapes the spatial organization of state bureaucracies and countries' political topographies. Yet, we lack theoretical and empirical knowledge on how state territories are divided into subnational governance units. This project argues that governments' preference for decentralizing power determines the alignment of administrative borders with ethnic geographies in multi-ethnic states. Centralizing governments will draw borders that crack groups into diverse units, while decentralizing governments ethnically align borders, packing groups into homogeneous divisions. I test this argument by studying administrative unit designs in colonial Africa contrasting centralized, direct French rule with decentralized, indirect British rule. Using newly digitized geographic data on precolonial ethnic and colonial administrative geographies, I assess the conditional effect of ethnic settlement patterns on administrative borders through a probabilistic spatial partition model. With novel theory, data, and methods, the results of the analysis will contribute to our understanding of the strategic origins of administrative geographies.	Comparative Politics

However, it is unclear how exactly national political elites can extract money from corporate endeavors they do not directly control. Importantly, most members of the political elite are not directly involved in legislative or parliamentary committee affairs with regulatory authority over the natural resource industry and cannot leverage such positions.In this paper, we identify the political elite as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and show that PEPs respond to natural resource discoveries and corresponding FDI inflows by establishing their own firms as vehicles for extracting money from the multinational corporations that invest in the natural resource industry. However, different factions of PEPs benefit differently from establishing corporate connections with multinationals, implying that the inflow of resources leads to a reconfiguration of wealth between competing elite groups. The study of how elites use their political offices to extract rents from natural resources – and how they distribute those rents between competing elite factions – is hampered by the fact that natural resource rents are not randomly distributed. We circumvent this problem by marshalling evidence from the case of Mozambique, which experienced a sudden and unexpected surge in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) after 2009, spurred by discovery of large reserves of natural gas.

This makes it hard for them to convince voters to switch from ‘the devil they know’. As such, prevailing explanations of regime durability are based primarily on characteristics of ruling party. When opposition parties win, it is reactive not proactive. I contend that this understanding exists because we overly focus on opposition office-holding at the centre like legislative and cabinet seats. In this study, I propose that local politics has important and overlooked role in shaping the long-term prospects of opposition parties and hence regime durability. I contend that opposition local control, opposition leadership of local governments, is a way opposition parties can threaten authoritarian regimes. When the regime loses local elections, opposition parties gain control of local institutions which gives them unprecedented autonomy over state capacity and resources. This allows opposition parties to build their credibility through service delivery and good performance. I therefore argue that opposition control weakens the regime's hold on power because it makes it easier for opposition parties to proactively win support by providing them with a record in government. In this article, I use qualitative and quantitative evidence from Tanzania to demonstrate that opposition parties invest in local state capacity and improve the quality of public services to proactively build up their credibility. I then draw on electoral data to show that patterns of opposition local control can explain the long-term development of opposition support in Tanzania.	Comparative Politics

Using a model of targeted spending with homogeneously informed voters, I show how diverse papers analysing a large range of issues in policy-making -- the role of interest groups, the influence of media, fiscal restraints, the effect of non-binding law, the impact of ideology -- rely on the possibility of partial control, partial screening, or both, when a representative voter benefits from less information. Building on this mechanism, I subsequently ask: if voters are heterogeneously informed, is it better to be part of a more informed elite or the less informed masses? How is the voters' welfare affected by the existence of a more informed elite? I show that the answers depend on the elite's ability to communicate with the masses and the nature of its additional information.	Formal Models

And how does local media structure these responses? After economic crises, local governments have to balance constituents' preferences for fiscal consolidation against incentives created by tax competition in decentralized countries. Underpinning this process is an institution that is viewed as essential for democracy: the local press. While the media can induce accountability, it can also expose constituents to reporting on the negative repercussions of a crisis, shifting preferences for policy responses. To make sense of these expectations, I compile a fourteen-year panel of 2,193 German municipalities, focusing on the critical areas of business and property taxation. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find that, against expectations of debt aversion, greater exposure to the crisis has a negative effect on local business tax rates. In the next step, I demonstrate that relative business tax cuts are largest in areas with a greater local media presence. I propose that a greater local media presence exposes constituents to more reporting on the negative repercussions of the crisis, increasing popular demands for responses that benefit the struggling local economy. I then present additional survey evidence to show that attitudinal changes are consistent with this mechanism. In contrast to prior work on left-ward preference shifts after economic crises, my findings highlight that constituents' perceptions of economic risk lead local governments to cut taxes for businesses.

A conjoint experiment on the effect of candidates’ autocratic past on voter preferences	266	When do voters choose candidates that were part of an autocratic regime? How does their autocratic past influence voters’ choices and perception? While there is a vast literature on the effects of candidates’ background on voters’ choices and preferences, there has been very little attention paid to these factors in new democracies. This lack of evidence has important implications for our understanding of the role that elites and citizens play in democratic consolidation and survival. Against this background, this pre-analysis develops and aims to test novel theoretical propositions on the effect of political candidates’ autocratic background on voters’ choices and preferences. Using a forced-choice conjoint experiment to be run in countries that have recently democratized (Tunisia, Ukraine and Moldova), this project aims to examine how candidates’ autocratic past affects voters perception of candidates’ commitment to democracy, suitability for office and likelihood of voting. Also, it aims to unpack how voters’ own commitment to democracy shapes their choices and perceptions of the candidates.	Comparative Politics

The dominant stereotypes are (politically) undesirable traits such as incompetence and weakness. At the same time, we often see portrayals of disabled people being inspirational, courageous, and heroic. Consequently, disabled candidates who stand for election need to think carefully about how to frame their impairments in order to gain – or at least not jeopardize – electoral support: ignore it; downplay its relevance; or frame it as a positive attribute that has provided them with valuable competences and personality traits and/or with policy-relevant experiences and knowledge. This study uses data from original online survey experiments to examine how voters react to disabled candidates’ self-portrayals. It draws upon real election material of disabled candidates in the UK to develop images and vignettes portraying different framings and test their effects on voter perceptions. The findings provide unique evidence that is relevant for scholars of electoral behaviour and disability studies but also for candidates and parties themselves.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Formerly major parties loose support, while green and radical right parties enter and become electorally more successful. How does this affect policy representation? On the one side, a diverse set of political parties offering distinct standpoints potentially diminishes the distance between voters and their representatives in parliaments. However, fragmentation might also have negative effects on policy representation. If fragmentation goes in hand with coalition governments located off the centre of the voter distribution, government representation diminishes with increasing fragmentation. Also, the number of potential coalitions increases when the effective number of parties increases. This can have negative effects on accountability, as the link between changes in the vote shares and changes in government composition is weakened. Applying multilevel regression models to survey data for Western Europe, this paper investigates the effects of fragmentation on policy representation and on accountability.

Evidence from Chile	213	Parties in contemporary world use simultaneously programmatic and non-programmatic strategies to link voters routinely. They do so through the introduction of different mechanisms in order to attract heterogeneous constituencies. Yet the literature on party-linkages do not offer a compelling explanation of the drivers and causal mechanisms of the hybrid linkage strategies. On the one side, Kitchelt's framework assume that mixing different linkages is implausible, since both strategies require specializations, organizational structures, and it is deemed too expensive. On the other hand, more flexible models, such Diversification of Linkages, Segmented Representation, Division of Labour, and Non-Policy model, focus the analysis on the variation of linkages across district socioeconomic conditions: programmatic portfolio appealing for wealthier citizens while particularistic distribution to poor voters. In this article I introduce a new framework to explain the drivers of hybrid linkage strategies at the local level. Using a mix-method strategy and intensive fieldwork in three urban Chilean municipalities with different socioeconomic features, I account that hybrid linkages are explained by two variables: 1. demand for targeted distribution (bottom-up mechanism) and 2. the political compromise of municipal authorities with programmatic distribution (top-down). I argue that hybrid linkages are observed when local authorities possess programmatic compromise and concurrently engage in quid-pro-quo, which in turn is triggered by local associations pushing for targeted distribution. The framework introduced in this research is currently being explored surveying leaders from local associations and municipal authorities from 52 municipalities in the Region Metropolitana, Chile.

I argue that in the early stages of democracies local concerns are more prominent in distant districts from the capital city than in nearby districts, and therefore the former deviate more from the average local party system than the latter. The effect of nationalization and centralization within districts over time depends on whether parties are highly centralized or consist of relatively autonomous regional or local party organizations.

Research on advanced democracies suggest the importance of following factors: the level of economic development (Kitschelt and Wilkinson 2007; Stokes et al 2013); quality and longevity of democratic institutions (Keefer 2007; Keefer and Vlaicu 2007); quality and capacity of state bureaucracy (Shefter 1994); organizational capacity of political parties (Han 2021; Keefer and Khemani 2005); organized capitalist interest groups (Kuo 2018); and voters’ perceptions of parties and state bureaucratic apparatus (Bustikova and Corduneanu-Huci 2017). These factors, however, cannot explain the emergence of programmatic competition in post-Soviet hybrid regimes where political parties proliferated following the dissolution of the Soviet Union but were unable to find their anchorage in the societal structures. Taking the case of Georgia, I argue that the change of government in 2012 election was a turning point when programmatic competition started to emerge. I compare the 2012 election to the regime change in 2003. Using content analysis of 46 party manifestos between 1992 and 2016 as well as 16 in-depth interviews with representative of Georgian political parties, I build an argument that actor characteristics such as access to financial resources and confidence in victory determine the choice of programmatic strategy of competition. At the same time, this is conditioned by the type of a political system – parliamentary or presidential.	Parties and Representation

Evidence from Japan, 1965-2016	997	Most existing studies of how electoral rules shape elections use aggregate data, lack plausibly exogenous variation in institutional variables of theoretical interest, and do not give a comprehensive account of the effects of rules on each stage of the electoral process. We study how district magnitude---a key source of institutional variation in electoral systems---shapes all stages of the electoral process. We collect new data on Japanese candidates and campaigns spanning five decades, and we use a difference-in-differences design based on within-district variation induced by court-mandated changes in magnitude. The results indicate that an increase in magnitude deepens and diversifies the partisan and demographic composition of the candidate pool. In addition, it reduces the average campaign spending per elector, and this effect is primarily driven by established candidates reducing spending on staff and printed materials. Finally, it weakens the electoral advantage of the dominant party, increases proportionality between vote and seat shares, and increases turnout.	Political Institutions

While some political economists have theorized that there is a natural affinity between free-trade interests and proportional electoral systems, recent research on the origins of Proportional Representation (PR) in Europe has paid little attention to the role of international trade. We bring trade theory back to the debate on the choice of electoral systems, and argue that a trade perspective provides an insightful complement to accounts based on domestic politics. To test implications of the theory, we leverage historical data from referendums on trade policy and the introduction of PR at the district level in Switzerland 1880-1918. This setting enables us to rule out alternative explanations using state fixed effects, district-level covariates, and an instrumental variable approach. In the decade before World War I, we find that there is a tight link between district-level popular support for free-trade and subsequent support for PR. A ten percentage point increase in support for the protectionist general tariff is associated with a five percentage point decrease in support for PR. This linkage persists to the 1918 adoption of PR. Furthermore, we employ a synthetic control approach to assess if the introduction of PR in 1918 dampened the growth of protectionism in the interwar period Our results have important implications for theories of endogenous political institutions.

While corruption revelations have been shown to influence citizens' voting, less is known about how outsiders take advantage of the heightened opportunity to enter the electoral race. I construct a novel measure of candidate-level anti-corruption leaning using the registered manifestos of more than fifty thousand mayoral candidates running between 2012 and 2020 in Brazil. I show that outsider candidates are, in general, more likely to rely on anti-corruption appeals. Next, I leverage the revelation of corruption in mayoral accounts in Brazilian municipalities, using the yearly randomized audits conducted by the federal government to test whether outsiders are more likely to take advantage of shifts in the salience of corruption. The results indicate that municipalities exposed to this valence shock experienced an increased entrance of outsider candidates. This paper points at how shifts in the salience of corruption can help overcome outsider candidates' barriers to entry; in doing so, it calls for future research on the possible effects on the prospects of democratic backsliding.

In this paper we argue that highly-educated (and also younger) people are in fact the strongest supporters of welfare. Instead, the problem for the left is that education now structures political competition geographically. We present evidence for our argument from Great Britain using multilevel regression and post-stratification based on historical social survey data and an original representative survey, comparing support for welfare and redistribution at the lowest level of local government (local authorities) in the mid-1990s to support in 2020. We show that areas' average incomes and unemployment rates have become less important as drivers of social policy support while educational attainment and age profiles have become considerably more important. This new geographic alignment of support along age and education lines is similar to 'second-dimension' divides over social issues and Brexit. It complicates the left's task in winning a majority for redistribution and welfare because relatively few places are very young or very highly-educated. Using data on vote shares we find that the Labour party is struggling to win moderately-educated and moderately-young areas, whereas it succeeded in moderate-income and unemployment areas in the 1990s. In geographic terms the education divide is now a redistributive divide too, but the left is only winning in the youngest and most-educated places.	Political Economy

This paper investigates how perceptions of and information about inequality in house prices affect individuals’ internal and external political efficacy, using new data from a large representative survey experiment that was administered in England and Wales.Previous research has established that people generally underestimate the extent of inequality in their community, and that high inequality undermines political participation of disadvantaged groups. Therefore, we hypothesise that less affluent respondents exhibit lower political efficacy and that experimentally exposing respondents to information about inequality in house prices at the local or national level reduces their political efficacy, especially among non-homeowners.We find that respondents who own (more valuable) houses report higher political efficacy, while those who are more concerned about inequality exhibit lower efficacy. However, informing respondents about the extent of inequality in house prices does not reduce external efficacy, and the effect on internal efficacy is positive. Moreover, we show striking heterogeneous effects. Non-owners have significantly lower internal efficacy than homeowners, but the gap vanishes when they are shown local house prices compared to the national distribution. This effect is particular to housing; it does not translate to other measures of affluence.These findings suggest that arguments which link perceptions of inequality and reduced political participation, may not apply to the housing market. Thus, our paper highlights the salience of the housing market for political behaviour and outcomes.	Political Economy

Focusing on different contexts, using different data, and drawing on different methods, existing scholarship has identified a number of factors that meaningfully predict welfare state attitudes. Although the literature has explored the effect of different types of asset ownership, much remains unknown about the way in which the distribution of wealth shapes preferences for redistribution. This article examines the impact of income composition inequality - or the degree to which income composition per se varies across the income distribution - on preferences for economic redistribution. I argue that citizens living in countries characterized by high income composition inequality, which denotes an economic system where the rich rely exclusively on capital income while the poor only earn labor income, are more in favor of a generous welfare state than people living in economies defined by low income composition inequality. This is because low income composition inequality is associated with greater dependence on other sources of income and lower exposure to employment risk. Nevertheless, this effect is conditional on respondents' income and education. Drawing on a novel database that further enriches our understanding of capital and labor income ownership in Europe, I test my hypothesis with individual- and aggregate-level data from 22 European countries between 2004 and 2018.

Organizations indeed lobby on behalf of their members' interests vis-à-vis powerful allies and decision-makers, but collective action also exercises its influence in the opposite direction: members’ behaviour is changed by participating in organizations.I analyse both mechanisms focusing on urban informal workers, an often relegated constituency that recent research has highlighted as especially prone to build pressure-group style organizations.By doing this, I seek to make two contributions. First, I show that in truncated welfare states the least likely promoters of redistribution, informal workers, may support policies with a redistributive content if, in their experience, such policies are effectively accessible to them, especially if they are tied to mechanisms of incorporation for excluded groups. Second, linking the individual and the organizational level, I show that informal workers that participate in collective action are more likely to favour redistributive action by the state, particularly if their organizations provide diverse forms of direct support to individual demands.I support this claim with evidence from an original survey conducted among street vendors in commercial areas in Mexico City, which includes a conjoint experiment on workers' policy preferences, and in-depth interviews conducted during 6 months of fieldwork.

This effect is particular to housing; it does not translate to other measures of affluence.These findings suggest that arguments which link perceptions of inequality and reduced political participation, may not apply to the housing market. Thus, our paper highlights the salience of the housing market for political behaviour and outcomes.	Political Economy

In this paper we argue that highly-educated (and also younger) people are in fact the strongest supporters of welfare. Instead, the problem for the left is that education now structures political competition geographically. We present evidence for our argument from Great Britain using multilevel regression and post-stratification based on historical social survey data and an original representative survey, comparing support for welfare and redistribution at the lowest level of local government (local authorities) in the mid-1990s to support in 2020. We show that areas' average incomes and unemployment rates have become less important as drivers of social policy support while educational attainment and age profiles have become considerably more important. This new geographic alignment of support along age and education lines is similar to 'second-dimension' divides over social issues and Brexit. It complicates the left's task in winning a majority for redistribution and welfare because relatively few places are very young or very highly-educated. Using data on vote shares we find that the Labour party is struggling to win moderately-educated and moderately-young areas, whereas it succeeded in moderate-income and unemployment areas in the 1990s. In geographic terms the education divide is now a redistributive divide too, but the left is only winning in the youngest and most-educated places.	Political Economy

Although this equality-efficiency trade-off has a long tradition in political discourse, we know surprisingly little what beliefs individuals hold about the effects of redistributive taxation. This inhibits our understanding of individual preference formation as well as the distributive conflicts that unfold in response to the current Covid pandemic. In this paper, we study what people believe about the macroeconomic effects of different taxes and whether those beliefs force them to trade off equality against efficiency. In the midst of Germany’s 2021 national election, we fielded a pre-registered conjoint experiment asking a broad sample of respondents to evaluate in how far different tax packages contribute to equality and growth. We find little evidence for equality-efficiency trade-offs in individual beliefs about personal income and wealth taxation, but we do find that such trade-offs are present for corporate taxation. Furthermore, such beliefs do not vary by ideology or economic status. These findings put into question common wisdom about policy beliefs and point to the need of considering these beliefs more closely in studies on political preferences and public opinion.

A possible underlying reason is that financial distress fosters perceptions of anomia and lack of support through political authorities. In a related vein, previous research shows that generous national social policies mitigate such effects of financial distress. In this study, we apply a local perspective arguing that communities provide relevant social policy measures and public services that are particularly visible and proximate for residents and thus have a distinct impact on the formation of political attitudes. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the link between financial distress and political discontent is moderated by (changes in) community social spending. To empirically gauge this conditional relationship, we use panel data from the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study merged with community-level data on social spending. Results from two-way fixed effects models show a substantial relationship between financial distress and political discontent. While this empirical link is largely homogeneous across communities with different levels of (as well as over-time changes in) social spending, we find effect differences with regard to the economic status of communities. In economically deprived communities, the negative relationship between financial hardship and political discontent is more pronounced than in wealthier communities. In terms of implications, our study provides evidence for a crucial interplay of individual-level deprivation and community conditions in shaping political attitudes, while governance through local social policy measures appears to be less relevant.

In this paper, I examine this question by turning towards perceptions of the economic distance to other economic groups and its consequences for support for redistribution that gives to the poor. I conduct a nationally representative survey experiment with British voters to test the argument that perceiving a smaller economic distance to the poor relative to the rich decreases support for redistribution that gives-to-the-poor. Specifically, I argue that self-perceived middle who perceive the economic distance to the poor as small have a fear of social decline and an aversion to fall to the bottom of the income hierarchy, with concomitant consequences for their support for giving-to-the-poor. I find that self-perceived middle-income voters who perceive a smaller economic distance to the poor become less supportive of redistribution that gives to the poor. Using data on perceptions of income distances in a large sample of countries, my observational analysis further demonstrates that self-perceived middle-income voters hold more positive attitudes toward giving-to-the-poor when they perceive a large income distance to the poor, thus supporting the status-anxiety explanation. These findings add knowledge to the puzzle why people do not respond to increasing inequality by wanting more redistribution: they do so because of distorted perceptions of the economic distance to the poor that hampers support for more redistribution.

However, the political response has been ambiguous, with policymakers offering both progressive reactions, such as wealth taxes, and regressive responses, such as flat tax systems. In this study, I approach this problem from the standpoint of public opinion and examine individual decision-making over the progressivity of the tax system when the issue of unequal tax compliance is salient. I argue that perceived tax cheating by the rich impacts redistributive attitudes, articulating four alternative hypotheses about the potential mechanism, founded in both material self-interest as well as normative logic. Findings from an original survey in Italy suggest that tax evasion lowers the demand for redistribution. Experimental results show that Italian respondents overestimated tax noncompliance and the salience of evasion and avoidance by the rich weakens preferences for tax progressivity.

In an online experiment, we test the hypothesis that identification with a party influence how a political message on a hot topic is processed and hypothesize that messages sent by an outgroup representative will be perceived as threatening, hence increasing affective polarization.

To test this argument, we develop a novel measure of elite-level polarization in parliamentary debates of the German Bundestag using dependency-parsing and embedding-enhanced dictionaries. We combine this measure with longitudinal public opinion data to disentangle the relationship between parliamentary discourse and partisan voters‘ opinions. Preliminary results suggest that elite-level hostility and partisan polarization are indeed correlated but the direction of causality is so far unclear.

74	Political elites & affective polarization	Panel	7f782e265a2fc9d8aaea3c7e83ca9be9	Royce Carroll	University of Essex	p	n	0903	Explaining affective polarization – The role of party messages	294	Affective polarization is based in social identity theory (SIT) and describes the intergroup differentiation between partisans that manifest as biased evaluations of the ingroup and the outgroup. In line with SIT, affective polarization increase as partisan identification becomes stronger, but also as a consequence of perceived intergroup threats (Renström et al. 2021). In an online experiment, we test the hypothesis that identification with a party influence how a political message on a hot topic is processed and hypothesize that messages sent by an outgroup representative will be perceived as threatening, hence increasing affective polarization. While most research on affective polarization is based on the US context, recent research indicate that affective polarization occurs on multi-party systems as well. We here explore Sweden, a multi-party system, which has a relatively high degree of affective polarization (Reiljan, 2019).To test this hypothesis, we presented participants with neutralized messages on politically charged topics such as immigration, gender equality and climate. The content was neutralized such that it did not contain any evaluative aspects and therefore were constructed in a way that it could plausibly come from any of the parties. The sender of the message was either an ingroup party representative, or an outgroup party representative. If the hypothesis is supported, this is a strong indication that identification with a party influences how a message is perceived and cognitively processed depending on whether it comes from a political in- or outgroup, and that these identities in fact lead to increased affective polarization.

What drives affective polarization? Observational studies have suggested that both elite polarization and interpersonal ‘echo chambers’ are drivers of polarization. In this study, we build on this literature to explore the micro-mechanisms of how the political environment shapes affective polarization. We argue that since affective polarization is rooted in emotional group-based attachments, they are best explored in a social setting. We use an experimental social setting - an online group discussion - to examine how affective elite polarization and group composition shapes affective polarization among partisans in Britain. Our participants, who are party supporters but otherwise broadly representative of the British population, are placed in groups with either like-minded partisans (an ‘echo chamber’) or in a heterogeneous group. They are also exposed to competing elite arguments about a policy issue that are more or less emotive in tone. Following a discussion on the policy, participants answer a survey about their attitudes towards in- and out-group partisans. This experimental design therefore enables us to examine how group composition and elite cues impact affective polarization of partisans.	Behaviour and Opinion

Coupled with strong partisan preferences present in many competitive democracies, this tolerance for illiberal anti-corruption methods may create illiberal anti-corruption double standards, whereby citizens condone the use of harsh measures against partisan opponents, while opposing such measures---or any anti-corruption measures---when directed at co-partisans. This preference structure can delegitimize good governance reforms and leave them vulnerable to politicization by strategic (and potentially corrupt) elites.

Rather than asking about support for democracy directly, we present subjects with a series of election scenarios in which candidates feature realistic policy platforms and (some) are experimentally assigned to endorse positions that violate key democratic principles. Subjects’ candidate choices in turn reveal their willingness to prioritize in their political choices democratic principles over partisan interests. We estimate the distribution of commitment to democracy across both individuals and countries, estimate the elasticity of substitution between democratic principles and a range of policy issues, and differentiate between democratic commitment to fair elections, civil liberties, and checks and balances. Our estimates of commitment to democracy predict the vote for candidates who undermine democracy better than standard, direct questioning measures.	Behaviour and Opinion

Yet studies of public support for judicial institutions has largely focused on domestic courts, leaving scholars with limited data and theoretical accounts for the public standing of international courts. In this paper we seek to address these limitations of the extant literature by evaluating the extent of the legitimacy enjoyed not only by two of the country’s highest courts, the German Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice, but also the European Union’s highest court, the Court of Justice (CJEU). To do so, we use data from a panel survey fielded in Germany to a nationally-representative sample of approximately 3100 respondents in October 2020. Building on the theoretical and empirical work of Gibson and Caldeira (1995, 1998), we first examine the political and socioeconomic determinants of support for each of these judicial institutions. The political factors we consider include ideology, partisanship, support for European integration, and support for democratic norms. As for socioeconomic variables, among others we examine respondents’ income, age, and whether a respondent was a resident in the former East Germany. We then turn to comparing these levels of support to identify the characteristics of individuals who support domestic German courts to a greater extent than they support the CJEU. Our findings provide insight into the extent to which domestic courts can extend legitimacy to the CJEU and serve as a conduit for the expansion of the scope of European Union law.	European Politics

Additionally, we reevaluate data from similar survey experiments conducted in the United States. Our results identify a seemingly common normative ideal that citizens have in mind with regard to the institutional selection and the characteristics of justices they prefer to be selected to highest courts. Citizens prefer professional judicial experts who are selected by parliament or by non-political experts rather than the executive branch. These results have a number of theoretical implications for our understanding of how to protect courts institutionally against court curbing efforts to diminish their power and independence and also some practical implications for ongoing reform discussions; i.e., in the United States.

The result is an increasing amount of research examining temporal and/or cross-sectional variation in judicial independence. While the validity of previous, simpler measures of de facto independence has been studied, to date no attention has been paid to the validity of these increasingly popular measures. This paper examines the content, construct, and face validity of these measures, examining the degree to which they effectively capture the historical record and track the well-known ""global expansion of judicial power"" that began in the second half of the 20th century. Quantitative analyses and comparative case studies demonstrate that while each has strengths, significant issues with validity mean careful attention is necessary in their use both cross-nationally and longitudinally in single countries.

Consequently, their external environment can change utility calculations behind judicial decision-making, as well as the subsequent policy implementation by governments. This raises the question: How do external actors impact judicial decision-making? I investigate the impact external actors take on judicial decision-making and outcomes at the French and German constitutional court. External actors, which constitutes the sets of actors which are not formally associated with the court, differ in their scope of issues, goals and resources, which shape their influence-taking. Based on the institutional setting, degree of politization and reputational concerns, I examine how final decisions of Justices are impacted by external actors. I argue that external actors shape these expectations as they speak to highest courts. Decision transparency – the pivotal moderator of a given case and its outcome – is derived from the institutional setting and the communication between the Judiciary and external actors. I find that the French court, where partisan considerations are more dominant, is more reputation-dependent compared to the German Court. Results suggest that the latter, in comparison, is more resilient to political discourse and opposition. This has major implications for our understanding of how the environment shapes the interaction between the political and the judicial sphere.	Comparative Politics

The mental load is thought to be distinct from the physical tasks of e.g., cooking, cleaning and shopping, and disproportionately undertaken by women. Thus far, the few studies addressing this topic have used qualitative methods to define and document it, and the topic has yet to be studied in political science research. As a result, we may be underestimating household gender gaps and their impact on political equality. To investigate this question, I field a descriptive survey of political engagement and household mental and physical labor to parents in the United States. One reason that research on the mental load has been qualitative thus far is that it is difficult to quantify mental work. It is not well-characterized by questions asked in, e.g., household time-use studies. My survey’s novel approach uses a series of questions that ask about who in the household does different types of cognitive labor tasks. I argue that women are likely to have higher “mental loads” than men, and that large mental loads are likely to be negatively associated with political engagement. The study also explores the role of household and individual-level characteristics, including relative income between partners, education, sexuality, and gender identities. The findings from this study will offer new empirical evidence about a gender gap which is currently hidden, and its consequences for gender equality in democratic life.	Gender Politics and Diversity

To answer this question, we exploit the sudden budget crisis in Massachusetts (MA) in 2015 and examine how methods that governments employ to downsize their agencies---increasing senior officials' discretion in setting compensation and adopting individualized negotiations---have unequal impacts on government employees. We use Trial Court employees as a control group and employ a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of the fiscal crisis on the gender pay gap in the bureaucracy. Using 1.4 million observations of detailed individual-level data about public employees in the MA state government for the period 2010-2020, we find that the fiscal crisis increased the gender pay gap in executive agencies by 7.3 percentage points. Consequently, women earned significantly less than their comparable male counterparts after the fiscal crisis. We also find that there is significant variation in the gender pay gap: women in more senior positions and women who work in agencies with smaller shares of female employees (public safety and transportation) experienced the largest gender pay gap.

The experiment allows us to answer two key questions about popular support for female-led protests: (1) are citizens less likely to support protest movements led by women relative to identical movements led by men? And (2) how does the gender identity of protesters shape the “menu of protest tactics” that the public deems acceptable?The paper brings together two literatures in comparative politics. On the one hand, there is a growing interest in how specific protest tactics shape popular support for protest movements. Specifically, citizens are more supportive of peaceful protests than those that involve more violent practices (e.g., destruction of property). On the other hand, an extensive literature shows that women in politics often face double standards and are penalized for engaging in the same behavior as their male peers. We expect to answer whether this type of double standard extends to the use of violent protest tactics.	Gender Politics and Diversity

We first classify households according to their income and educational level, and then apply the Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition method to carefully examine the differences between high and low classes of households. Our findings are mainly threefold. First, the changes in family policy (i.e. pursuing gender equality) had a significant effect on the gendered gap in childcare time; household inequality caused by educational factors was likely to disappear, whereas the effects of household income decreased. Second, the aforementioned effects were greater in 2019 compared to 2009. We assume this is because mothers have been able to gain more resources, while fathers could accumulate experiences of housework including childcare during the chosen decade. Third, the outcomes of decomposition, however, reveal that the gendered gap was still high in low-income households despite the family policy. On top of that, high-income mothers tended to take more burden than before. Based on the findings, we argue that there is still an urgent need to encourage fathers’ engagement in housework, and that household income should be a critical concern in making family policy.

We thus examine whether different parties try to link the discourse with different issues in order to gain political advantage. In the final step, we analyze how the tone of the parliamentary debate on the negotiations has changed. To what extent has it reflected the current state of the negotiations, or has it also been shaped more by partisan motives?

Over the past decade more focus has been on what impact such reforms have on MP behaviour, especially in terms of speech-making. In this paper speech-making in the Danish Parliament 1901-1939 is examined. Elections to the lower chamber underwent a reform in 1918-20 from single-member plurality to proportional representation, while indirect elections to the upper chamber remained unchanged. The focus of the paper is what the reform meant for how often MPs spoke and on what topics. It is examined whether the reform had an impact on how parties divided the responsibilities for policy areas among its members. Given that the reform was implemented in 1918 in the Capital region of Copenhagen and in 1920 across the entire country it is also explored whether those members with earlier experience of proportional representation saw an earlier change in behaviour. The findings are compared with speech-making in the upper chamber where given its unchanged electoral system we should not expect to see any change in speech-making. The analysis is further supported by text-analysis of specific debates before and after the electoral system change. Overall, the findings in the paper is that there was a clear impact on speech-making in that MPs with smaller majorities after the reform spoke more often and on more topics. This shows that they reacted to intra-party competition which was less important prior to the reform.	Legislative Studies

While previous research generally finds congruence between election pledges and policymaking activities in legislatures at the political party level, we know less about the relationship between campaign pledges and legislative priorities on the level of legislators. Analyzing Japanese candidate manifestos offers a unique opportunity to study whether issue emphasis in campaign communication serves as a meaningful signal of legislative activities. First, using supervised machine learning, we identify issue emphasis in over 56,000 sentences from over 1,000 manifestos by Japanese Members of Parliament between 2003 and 2017. Candidates with higher manifesto salience of a policy area are significantly and substantively more likely to take leadership positions in the Diet committees, the Cabinet, and the party in the same policy area. In addition, we find that such congruence is stronger for less important policy areas. Our findings suggest that campaign promises provide meaningful signals of subsequent legislative behavior.

They are the forum in which parties discuss their policy positions. Government parties use them to explain and justify their policies to the public, while opposition parties can scrutinise them. In these debates parties present their positions in front of their fellow parliamentarians but also the wider public. But which topics are members of parliament talking about in plenary debates and who talks about what? This paper presents a new annotated text corpus of the plenary debates of the German Bundestag between 1990 and 2013 and discusses the methods used to automatically classify each of the speeches into a policy topic. Each speech has been assigned to one ministerial portfolio using supervised classification methods. Such methods outperform simple topic models, as they give more steering capacity to researchers and the results can be evaluated against hold-out data. But they come with the obstacle that they require large amounts of training data which normally need to be created in time-consuming work by human coders. By using minister speeches as training data the paper proposes a time-efficient solution to this problem. Special attention is being devoted to evaluating the validity of the newly produced data. The paper’s contribution is thus twofold. First, it proposes a new way of annotating a large parliamentary text corpus that can be easily adapted to other countries or time frames. Second, it presents a new data set that offers many possibilities for research on the behaviour of parliamentarians.	Legislative Studies

An analysis on how virtual proceeding affected the content and influence of legislative speeches	770	During the COVID pandemic, virtual proceedings have been adopted by parliaments across the world as a temporary measure to meet the challenges that comes with lockdown and social distancing. However, virtual proceeding in parliaments could be beneficial beyond mere mitigation during the pandemic and it has been suggested by both scholars and practitioners that they could play a role in parliamentary procedure in the long run. This paper seeks to better understand how virtual proceedings affect the deliberative process in legislative debates. By analysing the content of contribution made by British MPs via teleconferencing software during the pandemic and contrasting them with contributions made by their colleagues in the House of Commons chamber during hybrid sessions, this paper seeks to understand whether virtual proceedings affect the emotion expressed as well as whether participating virtually adversely affect the influence of individual legislators during parliamentary debates.

Unpacking the Micro-Mechanisms	1121	In this paper we use cross-national survey data in combination with a novel, large-scale survey experiment fielded in three countries to understand and disentangle how foreign military deployments impact defense policies of host states. The theory of free-riding in military alliances postulates that member states piggyback on security commitments by guardian states. Because foreign military deployments (in the form of troops or nuclear weapons) render such promises particularly credible, guardians such as the U.S. regularly threaten withdrawal from NATO member states in order to undermine alleged free-riding. In this paper, we examine the micro-foundations—and mechanisms—of this logic. First, we utilize cross-national survey data from the European and World Value Survey to demonstrate that foreign military deployments do indeed decrease the significance citizen attribute to national defense. However, we argue that free-riding critically implies that foreign military deployments positively affect subjective feelings of security and reduce threat perceptions (due to assurance and extended deterrence). By contrast, if citizens suspect the guardian’s motives to be primarily self-serving by advancing foreign policy that may not be in the interest of host states, heighten the risk of host ‘entrapment’ in major (nuclear) war—in which national defense would be futile. Thus, in a second step we disentangle and trace these mechanisms by devising a survey experiment (n=6000; conducted in Germany, Czechia and the Netherlands) that (1) measures perceptions on the guardian's motives, (2) experimentally manipulates foreign military deployments, (3) examines threat perceptions, and (4) captures attitudes towards national defense.

This lack of attention to systematic changes in the structure and content of alliance treaties is a puzzle, especially when one considers how international relations scholars link different domestic political structures to variation in foreign policy behavior. In this paper, we build upon theory from the democratic peace and military alliance research programs to consider the implications of democratic governance on the nature of military alliances. Treaty obligations commit members to act in future international crises or military conflicts and therefore the risk that leaders will involve the nation in costly foreign conflicts increases. Democratic systems of government produce incentives for leaders to be cautious when conducting foreign affairs because of the ease by which constituents can punish leaders’ foreign policy failures with removal from office. Consequently, differences in domestic regimes create incentives for leaders to design and form different types of alliance treaties. Because the last two centuries contain a remarkable amount of change in domestic political institutions throughout the international system, we argue that the emergence of more democratic regimes will influence the types of military alliance commitments formed by states.

The benefits and costs of such affiliation have been addressed in the literature, but an attempt to theorize the variation in the behaviour of these groups and their decisions is still missing. The main argument that I propose lies in legitimacy seeking rationale. Given the importance of legitimacy for armed groups for status, success, and sustainability, I argue that when national/local Islamist militants run into a legitimacy deficit at the domestic level, they try to substitute for such shortfall at the external transnational level by affiliating with a network of global jihad like AQ or IS. I propose four factors that affect and indicate the legitimacy of militant groups at the national level: provision of social services, level of crime involvement (kidnapping), group age and group size. I test my argument quantitatively, using time-series cross-sectional data on 168 groups, over the years 1998-2016, including 37 affiliate groups. The results of the analysis show that groups that provide public services are less likely to affiliate with networks of global jihad, whereas groups that engage in kidnapping, and are of small size are more likely to affiliate.

However, it often takes many electoral cycles before a voter can be certain the policy chosen is right for them. We develop a model of a politician endogenously acquiring expert information, knowing that voters will also only have a noisy signal as to the rightness of the policy when they make their re-election decision. Policy institutions that are designed to enhance democratic accountability and responsiveness to voter policy preferences ex ante (e.g., strong, well-sorted parties; public votes) lead to strictly worse performance in terms of information acquisition. We discuss this general trade-off between accountability and performance, and its applications for constitutional design and the optimal division between legislatures and the executive/bureaucracy.

One of the most important tools is the agency's appropriations. We present a theory that incorporates (1) heterogeneous legislator preferences over bureaucratic activity, (2) legislative budgetary control, and (3) endogenous bureaucratic policy discretion to understand legislative incentives when appropriating funds to bureaucratic agencies. Our theory provides several insights: first, legislators' induced preferences over budgets are partially determined by their policy preferences; second, in some cases legislators who are ``opposed'' to the direction that the agency will take policy nevertheless support increased funding for that agency; finally, ``strange bedfellows'' coalitions in which legislators with competing policy preferences may nonetheless agree on their most-desired budget level for the agency.

Confronting these challenges has stimulated the use of techniques to establish a credible research design by developing an identification strategy. A critical part of this process, especially in quasi-experimental settings, is the analyst's theoretical account of exogenous variation in the mechanism that assigns units across different treatments. Such accounts often exploit an analogy between the quasi-experimental setting under scrutiny and a laboratory environment. How comprehensive, or how restrictive, are such analogies? In this article, we formulate the potential outcome framework in a way that isolates the role of assignment mechanisms---the key difference between experiments and quasi-experiments---to study the all-else-equal influence of an assignment mechanism on the estimands identified by a research design. We then use our framework to study how strategic factors influencing assignment affect the substantive interpretation of these estimands.	Formal Models

Following other types of comparative research, it is no surprise then that studies using computational text analysis methods (CTAM) are increasingly conducted in an international, inter-lingually comparative fashion (e.g., Lind et al., 2019). However, this rapid internationalization is hardly reflected in the development of CTAM. Owing to the considerable head start of English-language computational development—both due to early U.S. dominance in computer technology and due to the specific role of English as scientific lingua franca—many resources, tools, and training required for cutting-edge CTAM development are available only, or in far better quality, for English-language text analysis. This present study delves deeper into the relationship between languages and the use of CTAM methods, utilizing a novel dataset derived from a pre-registered survey of 421 social science researchers. Specifically, we examine how the language of analysed texts influences researchers’ validity concerns about the use of CTAM methods. We also examine what motivations prevent researchers from examining multilingual textual corpora. Our results will inform the debates on strengthening the link between CTAM tool development on the one hand and social science research on the other.	Political Methodology

A recent paper by Porter and Velez recommends that researchers should use automated processes to construct a corpus of related placebo conditions, which are then randomly sampled from during survey implementation. While we agree with their general recommendation, we suggest that researchers use caution if they employ the tool Porter and Velez recommend for placebo construction, OpenAI’s semi-supervised language model GPT-2. Through a series of simulations, we conduct the largest assessment yet of GPT-2’s biases by measuring the sentiment of 1,083,750 potential placebos generated across 4,335 unique seed phrases. We show that the polarities of placebos vary tremendously across seed phrases based on the race/ethnicity, gender, sexual and religious orientation, political affiliation and ideology, or state or territory demonym included in them. We also show considerable heterogeneity in the substance of placebos across seed phrases. Comparing our results to a similar analysis of the text corpus used to train GPT-2, we find that the language model does not just learn to reproduce biases in source material, but also creates its own. Taken together, our findings suggest that researchers should exercise great caution in using GPT-2 as an agnostic approach to generating placebos — particularly for identity-focused experiments. Finally, we offer a Google Colaboratory notebook to mitigate the effects of these biases and provide best practice recommendations for automatic placebo generation.	Political Methodology

So far, research has mostly dealt with automatically classifying documents for one specific document type. Even though such an approach is more cost-efficient compared to manually coding the entire corpus, it still requires considerable human resources to create a training dataset for every set of documents at hand. An alternative strategy to reduce manual labor is to train a classifier on already existing data and use that classifier to code a virgin corpus of another set of documents. We propose an innovative resource-efficient two-step workflow to classify documents from a case that the classifier was not trained on. We use the Multiclass Ensemble Cutoff Classifier Approach (MECCA) as the foundation and add a second iteration step. We demonstrate how the outlined two-step workflow functions in practice by using it to label council questions from the German local level with a classifier trained on parliamentary questions from the German Bundestag using the Comparative Agenda Project’s coding scheme. The Bundestag dataset consists of 22,181 manually coded documents. The local-level dataset comprises 14,640 questions from the most recent full legislative period of 31 German cities with over 100,000 inhabitants. Our results show that the classifier correctly predicts more than 70 percent of all council questions with a precision above 80 percent and is therefore on par with human coding.

Understanding judicial behavior in electoral disputes is crucial as the politicization of courts is at the heart of contemporary autocratization efforts at the same time as courts in backsliding and hybrid regimes increasingly are asked to settle electoral disputes. Yet, while recent scholarship has examined losing candidates' strategic decisions to litigate and the consequences of judicial decisions for public opinion, there is still a dearth of scholarship concerning the politics of how judges adjudicate electoral disputes. This paper leverages a comprehensive dataset on electoral disputes in Zambian courts, which are routinely asked to intervene in elections. We examine both the political and career considerations that influence electoral justice and how litigation patterns are shaped by anticipation of strategic judicial decision-making. Our preliminary expectations are that judicial review allows political elites to challenge electoral results through legal means, but that judicial decision-making is constrained both by judges’ reliance on political actors to enforce their decisions and because individual judges may fear sanctions from powerful political actors. Judges can therefore be expected to be reluctant to invalidate results in constituencies won by the ruling party. Anticipating judicial restraint, opposition parties will also be less likely to challenge such results in court.	Comparative Politics

In many of these cases, we can observe that populist politicians attack high courts verbally or undermine judicial independence through court-curbing or -packing. While we know that populism is incompatible with independent high courts, we know much less about how high courts react to the threat that the rise of populist parties poses to them. To my best knowledge, this is the first paper to examine court reactions to the rise of populism. By increasing their public relations efforts high courts can ensure that the public is informed about their decision and why it was taken. I study whether decisions are accompanied by a press release more often if a law under review was legislated by a populist government relying on an original dataset of press releases by the Austrian and Italian Constitutional Court. In further analyses, I examine whether the language used in press releases is easier to understand when high courts face populist parties.	Political Institutions

At the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), published judgments are unsigned, but there is a Judge-Rapporteur who is responsible for writing a preliminary draft of the judgment. How much influence does the Judge-Rapporteur have over the content of the final judgment versus non-Rapporteur judges? The answer to this question is important to our understanding of judicial bargaining, which happens behind closed doors. In this paper, we develop a strategy for estimating the influence of individual judges on the content of published judgments. Using a new text corpus that includes the universe of CJEU judgments (1952-2021), we train machine learning algorithms to learn the style of individual Judge-Rapporteurs. We then identify specific sentences in judgments that are more likely to have been written by a non-Rapporteur judge on the panel than by the assigned Judge-Rapporteur. We use our models’ predictions assess the relative influence of Judge-Rapporteurs and non-Rapporteur judges on the text of judgments. We also identify the observable correlates of Judge-Rapporteurs and non-Rapporteur judges who have systematically more influence than their colleagues.	Political Institutions

Using a unique dataset of over 900 amicus curiae briefs from the Bulgarian Constitutional Court hearing cases of constitutional review and legal interpretation, we find that the Court is more inclined to incorporate the reasoning of briefs from powerful government actors rather than non-governmental groups. These results call into question whether the amicus curiae process in Bulgaria lives up to democratic expectations for including less powerful civil society and special interest viewpoints into decision-making. The study is one of the first of its kinds to explore how the reasoning found within amicus curiae influences an important apex court outside of the United States.	Political Institutions

At the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), published judgments are unsigned, but there is a Judge-Rapporteur who is responsible for writing a preliminary draft of the judgment. How much influence does the Judge-Rapporteur have over the content of the final judgment versus non-Rapporteur judges? The answer to this question is important to our understanding of judicial bargaining, which happens behind closed doors. In this paper, we develop a strategy for estimating the influence of individual judges on the content of published judgments. Using a new text corpus that includes the universe of CJEU judgments (1952-2021), we train machine learning algorithms to learn the style of individual Judge-Rapporteurs. We then identify specific sentences in judgments that are more likely to have been written by a non-Rapporteur judge on the panel than by the assigned Judge-Rapporteur. We use our models’ predictions assess the relative influence of Judge-Rapporteurs and non-Rapporteur judges on the text of judgments. We also identify the observable correlates of Judge-Rapporteurs and non-Rapporteur judges who have systematically more influence than their colleagues.	Political Institutions

Understanding judicial behavior in electoral disputes is crucial as the politicization of courts is at the heart of contemporary autocratization efforts at the same time as courts in backsliding and hybrid regimes increasingly are asked to settle electoral disputes. Yet, while recent scholarship has examined losing candidates' strategic decisions to litigate and the consequences of judicial decisions for public opinion, there is still a dearth of scholarship concerning the politics of how judges adjudicate electoral disputes. This paper leverages a comprehensive dataset on electoral disputes in Zambian courts, which are routinely asked to intervene in elections. We examine both the political and career considerations that influence electoral justice and how litigation patterns are shaped by anticipation of strategic judicial decision-making. Our preliminary expectations are that judicial review allows political elites to challenge electoral results through legal means, but that judicial decision-making is constrained both by judges’ reliance on political actors to enforce their decisions and because individual judges may fear sanctions from powerful political actors. Judges can therefore be expected to be reluctant to invalidate results in constituencies won by the ruling party. Anticipating judicial restraint, opposition parties will also be less likely to challenge such results in court.	Comparative Politics

Stakeholder consultations are particularly relevant for non-elected institutions, such as executive bureaucracies, for which stakeholder engagement represents a unique opportunity to build input and throughput legitimacy and to gather (broad) public support for their proposed policies. When and how the constellation of different consultation mechanisms affects the levels of stakeholder support for legislative proposals constitutes a key theoretical and empirical puzzle that currently remains unaddressed in a systematic manner in the literature on stakeholder engagement in democratic policymaking. The study addresses this gap and focuses empirically on one of the most complex and institutionalized stakeholder consultation regimes: that implemented by the European Commission since 2016 when the European executive significantly expanded the scope and breath of stakeholder engagement across different stages of its policy formulation processes. The study examines the extent to which different consultation mechanisms (i.e., online consultations, feedback opportunities, etc.) employed when formulating European policies shape the levels of stakeholder support for draft legislative proposals across different policy areas. The study elaborates an argument explaining how institutional characteristics of consultation design, characteristics of stakeholder participation in consultations and key characteristics of policy areas contribute towards explaining the conditions under which public consultation mechanisms elicit varying levels of stakeholder support. This argument is tested on a new dataset recording information about stakeholder consultations and expressed stakeholder support for 469 EC draft legislative proposals adopted during the 2016-2021.

Yet, since the Commission ultimately needs to reconcile these diverse preferences and interests in one coherent policy proposal, the question of whose positions prevail in public consultations under which conditions is highly relevant. In the existing literature, lobbying success has been explained by individual-level factors, such as an actor’s resource endowment, or contextual factors, such as the complexity of the policy in question. In this paper, we argue that these two aspects should not be separated and suggest that complexity acts as a moderator and preselection mechanism between individual-level factors and lobbying success. In particular, we expect that, first, complexity raises the information needs of the Commission. Actors that possess the necessary resources can provide this information and are hence able to steer the Commission proposal into their direction in complex settings. Second, complexity raises the costs of participation, incentivizing lobbying actors to self-select into settings where they deem their chances of success higher. We test these propositions on a novel dataset containing more than 700 consultation responses and develop a novel measure for lobbying success based on document embeddings. We show that the measure outperforms prior automated approaches significantly and allows us to study lobbying success in a large-n setting.	European Politics

Despite the stated goal of the Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda (BRA) to improve and increase citizen participation in online consultations, little is known about the policy preferences citizens express in these consultations and the extent to which they overlap with the preferences of different interest groups. This article argues that consultations on policy issues with more concentrated costs and diffuse benefits, are likely to mobilize citizens and interest groups with relevant specialized knowledge, which increases preference alignment on these issues. The article further argues that interest groups with traditionally more outsider resources, have more experience with mobilizing citizens, which has a positive effect on preference alignment with the participating citizens. The argument is tested based on a dataset consisting of stakeholder responses to online public consultation questionnaires. To test the argument, I regress a dyadic dependent variable to measuring preference alignment on variables capturing policy issue-specific and interest group-specific characteristics. This article will contribute to our knowledge about the lobbying behavior of individual citizens participating in consultations and their preference similarity to different interest groups.

As communication attempts of the European Commission are shown to be exceedingly complex, research has indicated that such communication may instead weaken than strengthen public EU support, as complex messaging may increase aversion towards the EU and strengthen perceptions of the technocratic nature of the institution.Implementing a preregistered survey experiment in Germany (N = 1200), I investigate the effects of complex messaging on attitudes towards two infringement procedures against Germany instigated by the European Commission related to two directives: The Habitats Directive and the Electricity and Gas Directive.I show that more accessible language markedly improves support for the infringement procedures. This effect is especially strong for supporters of the EU and individuals with comparatively high or low education. An exploratory analysis of the effects of this treatment on emotional self-reports shows that less complex language does not lead to a backlash from EU opponents. This study's results could help understand the conditions under which self-legitimation strategies of EU institutional actors are likely to be effective.	European Politics

In this paper, we investigate the role of social context. Decades after the development of the canonical ""Spiral of Silence"" model, the public sphere has radically shifted toward a networked space mediated by social platforms. We articulate a theory of social influence in social media expression and test it by analyzing unique datasets linking U.S. survey respondents to their public Twitter accounts. To measure political expression, we develop and validate a supervised classifier of tweet-level ideology and apply it to respondents' tweets and the tweets of people they follow. We find that the ideology of Twitter followees' tweets is predictive of respondents' own expressed ideology on Twitter, even after holding constant self-reported ideological predispositions. Finally, we present an experimental study in which we directly manipulate Twitter users’ networks, allowing us to measure over-time changes in opinion expression.	Political Communication

Our results provide new insights into how multi-modal online communication strategies are used by candidates to build a public persona during electoral campaigns.	Political Communication

Evidence from Large-Scale Data and Experiments	822	Expressing opinions on social media has become a standard form of participation in the political process, but we know little about the factors that shape it. In this paper, we investigate the role of social context. Decades after the development of the canonical ""Spiral of Silence"" model, the public sphere has radically shifted toward a networked space mediated by social platforms. We articulate a theory of social influence in social media expression and test it by analyzing unique datasets linking U.S. survey respondents to their public Twitter accounts. To measure political expression, we develop and validate a supervised classifier of tweet-level ideology and apply it to respondents' tweets and the tweets of people they follow. We find that the ideology of Twitter followees' tweets is predictive of respondents' own expressed ideology on Twitter, even after holding constant self-reported ideological predispositions. Finally, we present an experimental study in which we directly manipulate Twitter users’ networks, allowing us to measure over-time changes in opinion expression.	Political Communication

Conjoint experimental evidence during the Afghan crisis	919	As data journalism has proliferated, audiences increasingly encounter objects such as charts and graphs in media. These outputs are often used in fact-checking settings to correct false beliefs. Yet they also involve presentational choices made by designers and editors. Broader interest in “telling stories with data” suggests that visualizations may change viewers’ perceptions and attitudes beyond belief accuracy. But is this the case for information that is topical and timely—in other words, when data journalistic outputs might be especially desirable? I address this question by means of a pre-registered conjoint experiment containing data visualizations about the scale and geographic composition of refugees entering the UK between 2001-20. These treatments, created by a professional visualizer to enhance external validity, randomly varied along four dimensions within designers’ abilities to change: chart type, dominant color, editorial framing, and labelling the data source. I fielded the experiment to a nationally-representative British sample (N=3,082) in August 2021 during the initial Afghan humanitarian crisis. Although exploratory analysis shows humanitarian framing led to more positive views of the government’s handling of refugee issues compared to the mean, the pre-registered hypotheses focusing on differences among design choices revealed mainly null results. This suggests specific visualization designs’ efficacy on salient topics may either depend on audience characteristics (which I also measured) or are perhaps more limited than commonly believed.

An analysis of identity conflict in Scandinavian parliaments	301	Many political systems are becoming increasingly polarized and several scholars have suggested that the deep partisan divisions in society derive not simply from ideological policy disagreement but from social-identity conflicts (Mason, 2013; 2018), suggesting a so called affective polarization, in which political opponents are seen as a disliked outgroup (Iyengar et al., 2012; 2019). Scholars are increasingly interested in the topic of polarization among political elites, particularly in the context of the deepening divisions in the US Congress (McCarty et al., 2016). In European multiparty systems, we know much less about polarization among political elites, especially polarization in terms of identity conflict. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine affective polarization at the elite level in Europe. We focus on the relationship between the backgrounds of members of parliament (MPs) and affective polarization in parliament, and investigate whether MPs with a specific background are ‘driving’ affective polarization. We argue that how distinct MPs from the same party are in terms of their backgrounds compared to MPs from other parties should matter for how polarized they are. Based on social identity theory, we expect that MPs with fewer overlapping social identities with MPs from other parties are more likely to be affectively polarized, since in- and out-group distinctions are likely to be clearer in these instances. We evaluate our expectations using data on Norwegian and Swedish MPs and a computational method for content analysis to analyze the emotional content of their parliamentary speeches since the early 1990s until today.

Economic voting in polarized politics	915	Elite polarization has become a central feature in American politics and many other democracies that experience the rise of radical political leaders and parties. The literature on economic voting shows that political context affects voters’ ability to attribute responsibility for economic conditions. Does polarizing politics influence economic voting? In this paper, I propose a theoretical framework and an empirical strategy to investigate the impact of elite polarization on economic voting in American Presidential elections. Based on micro-level foundations, I derive general predictions and use them to hypothesize how elite polarization works as a moderator of economic voting in the electorate. Results from seemingly unrelated regressions with election results at the county level show that, under polarizing politics, the electorate is less likely to sanction the incumbent party for unemployment. Even abstention becomes a less attractive option as polarization increases. Models with ANES data present similar findings: as the perceived gap between parties increases, partisans who negatively evaluate the economy become less likely to punish their preferred party. The ideological gap reduces the probability of voting across party lines due to a poor economy among Republicans. For Democrats and Independents, polarization decreases mainly the tendency to abstain when they negatively evaluate the economy. These findings show that polarizing politics clouds the responsibility for economic conditions, decreasing voters’ willingness to hold the incumbent party accountable.	Parties and Representation

They identify factors such as economic conditions, natural resources, and rebel and government characteristics which affect conflict severity. However, these measures do not take civil war dynamics such as changes in territorial control into account and therefore provide an incomplete picture. Territorial control affects rebel tactics used against the government and local civilians. I argue that momentum, specifically rebel or government territorial advances, affects the timing, location and intensity of state-based and one-sided violence. Drawing on recent advances in measuring territorial control in civil conflicts and using spatio-temporal autoregressive models, I estimate the effect of levels of territorial control and changes to them on the occurrence and intensity of state-based and one-sided violence by governments and rebel groups. Evidence from Nigeria suggests that changes to territorial control are better predictors for violence than current levels of control. This paper contributes to the literatures on civil conflict severity and intensity and spatial analyses of civil conflicts by exploiting variation in territorial control across time and space and showing mechanisms at the grid cell-month-level.

Campaign contributions are often mentioned among the possible channels creating opportunities for richer people to exert disproportionate influence on policymakers. At the same time, by exacerbating economic disparities, public policies that favour the wealthy might also give them a greater relative weight in the donor pool, hence creating a self-reinforcing spiral between material wealth and political influence. Using data from the US at the census tract level, we present two types of evidence on the link between economic inequality and the concentration of campaign contributions. First, we document a number of socio-economic patterns in the evolution over time of campaign contributions during the period 1985-2014, showing that growing income inequality is associated with an increased concentration of donations at the top of the income distribution. Then, we analyze the effect of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, a remarkable tax cut that decreased the marginal tax rates disproportionately at the top of the income distribution. We show that this policy decision caused a spike in contributions from citizens in the top 10 percent of the income distribution, thus rising their political clout. Our conclusion is that the Tax Reform Act, a landmark policy of the second Reagan administration, has been a crucial step in the spiral between economic inequality and uneven political influence of the last four decades.

And what explains the cross-national variation in countries’ response (or lack thereof) to inequality? Combining insights from electoral geography with political economy models of redistributive politics and partisan strategies, I argue that the spatial distribution of inequality undermines the political logic of redistribution when elections are held under plurality rule. When inequality in the median district is lower than in the nation as a whole, demand for redistributive policies and voting for left parties is concentrated in few districts. This limits the number of seats left-wing parties gain in elections while reducing left-wing parties’ incentives to offer pro-redistributive platforms. I provide empirical evidence for my argument using cross-national data on regional inequalities, local-level administrative and geo-coded survey data from the United Kingdom, and comparative manifesto data. The findings offer a new explanation for why some countries redistribute more than others, suggesting that political geography can weaken political responses to inequality and electoral representation.

Following Algan et al. (2016), we hypothesize that trusting individuals are more supportive of redistribution in favor of target groups with a low cost of free-riding, like the poor or the unemployed, provided that the institutional environment is more likely to restrain free-riding behavior. We also hypothesise that the personal observation of economic shocks, through affecting priors about neediness, increases the willingness to contribute, regardless of trust. We build a simple model to formalize what these joint hypotheses entail empirically, and test the theoretical predictions employing data from the Life in Transition II survey. We confirm that the effect of individual trust on supporting redistribution in favor of the poor and the unemployed increases with the quality of formal institutions. Trust and formal institutions, that is, are complements with respect to their effect on preferences for redistribution. Less trusting people are only inclined to contribute if they observe a high level of neediness in their direct environment, implying that perceived neediness and trust are substitutes in the preferences for redistribution. Results are robust to a series of robustness checks and placebo tests. To deal with endogeneity concerns we use historical prevalence of infectious disease and veto players as instruments for the quality of formal institutions and employ historical variability of the climate (Buggle and Durante, 2021) as an instrument for trust. The results are robust to this instrumentation strategy.	Political Economy

An 1894 democratic reform to councils that provided social insurance in Britain is used as the treatment event in a difference-in-difference analysis. The reform removed institutional features - a graduated franchise, property qualifications, the absence of a secret ballot, and the participation of unelected magistrates - that helped landowners seize control of spending on poor relief after the 1832 Great Reform Act. The results support theories arguing that inequality strengthens elite oppositionto democratization: more unequal districts experienced greater increases in government expenditure following the democratic reform.

Understanding this is particularly relevant given that universal basic income is increasingly seen as a desirable alternative to existing selective schemes. I explore this question by drawing on original survey data from Finland and Spain. Results suggest that most individuals perceive targeted schemes as more redistributive, albeit with variation across contexts. These perceptions are not predicted by ideology and are unrelated to redistribution support. Crucially, I find that perceptions have an indirect impact on support for redistribution in Finland, where middle-incomes are more supportive of redistribution if they perceive universality to be more redistributive, which offers evidence of an individual-level mechanism of macro-level literature on welfare states (i.e., Korpi and Palme, 1998). These results have far-reaching implications for the study of welfare preferences and the politics of redistribution.	Political Economy

The party's electoral fortunes are abysmal and its membership basis is dwindling. This paper contributes to an edited volume on the structural problems of European Social Democratic parties. It analyzes in great empirical detail the causal factors that have contributed to the demise of the former catch-all cewnter-left party. Empirically, it draws on political party publications, interviews with party leaders, analysis of relevant secondary literature and parliamentary debates. It also presents electoral results from national and regional elections. Conceptually, there are six core factors that have contributed to the decline of the SPD's fortune: the corrosion of the socioeconomic milieu, the lack of programmatic coherence and clarity regarding key political economy challenges of the 21st century, the demise of the links to the working class, unclear answers to the pressing questions regarding future welfare reform, an out-of-touch stance on immigration and integration and a less than articulate position regarding a center-left vision on European integration. The paper contributes to the growing literature that explores the root causes of flux and turmoil in contemporary European party politics.	Comparative Politics

The decline of Italy’s centre-left	93	This paper analyses the decline of Italy's centre-left in the last 30 years. It does so by tracing the peculiar evolution of Italian social democracy. Contrarily to other Western European countries, Italy was characterized by a Communist party that was electorally stronger than the Socialist one. Through the 1990s, the Italian Communist Party evolved and changed its name twice. Then, in 2007, it merged with other progressive parties (included a Christian-democratic one) to create the Democratic Party (PD), which exists until today. The paper reviews several potential explanations for the decline of Italian social democracy, like the decline of the working class, structural changes in the economic system, and the party’s stances on the welfare state and immigration. It also shows how the PD is nowadays, like other social-democratic parties in Europe, the party of high-education voters, who have a high trust in political institutions and in the EU – certainly not the party of the ‘left behind’ citizens.

First of all, some historical lines of development and national peculiarities are elaborated, before focusing on the last 20 years, i.e. the period since the turn of the millennium. In particular, the development of the SPÖ's programme and organisation, its focus in terms of personnel and content in phases of government and opposition and thus also its position in the political system, the development in nationwide elections (National Council, European Parliament, Federal Presidency) and, in an exemplary fashion, in state parliamentary elections, the socio-structural composition of the electorate, and the influence that key political events had on the Social Democratic Party are examined. This refers to national as well as international events and developments such as the financial and economic crisis of 2008, the so-called refugee crisis of 2015, recent political scandals (keywords: ""Ibiza” and “Kurz”) and, of course, the political disputes concerning the current pandemic. The aim is to name and discuss the reasons and causes for the SPÖ's not completely seamless but successive decline, both in elections and among members, and the associated loss of political significance.

The chapter contends that the party’s degeneration and decay has commonalities with structural forces afflicting social democratic parties across Europe. The six changes mirror the core themes of this volume: first, class dealignment and the long-term erosion of the working-class; second, the Labour party’s cultural and political disconnection from working-class voters; third, an inability to respond to structural changes in the economy and labour markets arising from technological change, digitalisation and global economic integration; fourth, weakening of the traditional welfare state following the demographic shift towards an ageing society; fifth, the debate about immigration and multiculturalism which forced questions of national identity onto the political agenda in western European countries, uncomfortable territory for Left parties; and, finally, the long-term impact of European integration, resulting in the UK’s referendum decision in 2016 to leave the European Union (EU). Before analysing each of these factors in turn, the chapter briefly dissects the nature of centre-left decline in the UK.	Comparative Politics

This paper will analyze why the Danish trend for the center-left in general and the Social Democratic Party in particular has differed from the situation in many other European countries over the last 15-20 years (cf. Keating and McCrone 2013). In the framework, six themes have been put forward in order to explain and understand the decline of the center-left in Europe. They comprise the following: 1) The objective decline of the working class milieu and the resulting membership level of trade unions. 2) The unclear positioning of the center-left toward globalization and increased international competition. 3) The lack of organic linkage between the leadership of the Social Democratic Party and the working class. 4) The unclear agenda of the Social Democrats concerning the welfare state. 5) The refusal of the Social Democrats to acknowledge the negative effects of immigration. 6) The center-left support of European integration without fully recognizing its negative impact for workers. Because the center-left of Denmark has not declined, the arguments in this paper are to a certain extent concentrated on explaining why these themes have not contributed to its weakening.

However, the potential impact of political violence on individuals can only travel through the media. The visibility of social and political actors in public debates after political violence largely depends on media outlets’ ideology and strategy. To gain a better understanding of the media gatekeeping mechanisms that potentially influence and distort individuals' perceptions of political violence, we study how media outlets shape public debates at the intersection of issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration after fatal acts of political violence in Germany (1995-2020). Within this framework, we investigate the emerging issues, frames, and central actors in the public sphere after such events, and how sustained or dynamic their visibility and resonance endure afterwards. We focus on larger periods before and shortly after an event. First, drawing on two mainstream German newspapers, we investigate more narrowly public reactions by social and political actors from core-sentence analysis to understand their agenda-setting dynamics and framing after acts of political violence since 2016. Second, based on seven German newspapers, we use topic models to investigate the effect of acts of political violence on public debates since 1995. Herein, we analyze differences within the newspaper landscape across time to identify outlet-specific trends. Our results have important implications for our understanding of how newspaper media shape public debates after political violence, and which social and political actors gain visibility and can dominate the political agenda more effectively.

Currently, 24 countries in the world have a woman president or prime minister (UN Women). Historically, more than 70 countries worldwide have had a woman executive. However, most countries, around 65%, have never had a woman executive, including prominent and powerful countries such as The United States and Russia (Britannica). In this research, I aim to answer the question: given the historical absence of women in executive positions and the recent numerical increase of women executives, what social and political factors enable women to rise to the highest level of government? In this regard, I use the regional case of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Noting that most of the 19 countries that I survey in CEE (13 of 19) have had a woman executive, I analyze the paths to political power of several women leaders in the region, including Ana Brnabic of Serbia and Zuzana Caputova of Slovakia. I also analyze the cases where there have been no women executives, such as Montenegro and Albania to provide women not attaining executive power. In terms of organization, this research first puts forth a global picture of women executives, noting the disparities in terms of countries and regions. Subsequently, the paper highlights the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, using case studies as example of divergent paths to power by women executives and cases where there have never been women at the executive level.

Despite advancements in gender equality, the underrepresentation of women and the voting gap persist. New targeting capabilities allow parties to easily and precisely target ads, possibly increasing gender differences in voting. Yet, we know little about whether and how parties use gender-targeted appeals. Parties have an incentive to target and tailor ads by gender because appeals can affect the voting behavior of women and men differently. I further expect that the use of gender-targeted appeals depends on the partisan composition and demographic profile of the targeted groups. I test my argument using a new dataset of all Facebook ads from 136 parties matched with survey responses for the 2019 European Parliament elections across 28 countries. Identity-appeals on parties’ campaign ads are identified using computational vision. My findings have implications for our understanding of gender in party competition and the debate on online voter targeting.	Gender Politics and Diversity

Women's representation in the international courts is crucial not only because half of the population in the world is female but also women's ability to act as a kind of bridge for other underrepresented groups such as older people, children, racial and religious minorities. This paper studies the effect of gender of judges in the ECHR. It focuses on whether female judges decide differently than male judges and whether the European Union membership plays any role in the selection of judges. I will use causal inference methods to present this effect.	Gender Politics and Diversity

And What Does She Say about Men?	1132	The European Union has been recognized as a leading actor in women’s empowerment and gender equality policy. Several recent studies underline the interaction of backlash against gender equality with Euroscepticism, more often expressed by men. This leads to the question whether the EU policy-makers see men as potential beneficiaries of European policies.With the conceptual lens of policy target populations (Schneider and Ingram 1993), this study analyses quantitatively and qualitatively two data sources: the full dataset of 45 thousand press releases of the European Commission since 1985 and all gender equality strategies of the EU since 1982.We show that since the 1990s, and particularly since 2008, gender has been successfully mainstreamed in Commission’s communication, appearing in up to 13% of press releases in 2018. This progress has helped in establishing the image of women as a “deserving and politically powerless group” and allowed to broaden the spectrum of policies aiming at supporting women. However, it has also introduced the negative portrayal of men as a “non-deserving and politically powerful group.”The negative image of men excludes the possibility of creating policies targeted at men, unless their goal would be to help women. Our analysis of gender equality strategies shows how men’s problems are known and mentioned by the Commission but not treated as worthy of targeted policies, even if the inequalities arise in unequal access to and use of EU programmes like Erasmus+.The paper may also fit tracks: ""Gender Politics and Diversity"", ""European Politics"", ""Political Communication.""

Analysing voting explanations in the European Parliament	1004	Previous research has shown that legislators defecting from the party line often take the opportunity to provide an explanation for their behaviour on the parliamentary floor. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, researchers have not yet looked into the justifications that legislators provide for their voting decisions. Do legislators provide well-grounded rationalizations of their defection or do they simply deliver empty statements to create a positive record for themselves? I address this question by studying a multilingual corpus of 151,460 oral and written voting explanations from the eighth European Parliament (2014-2019). Using natural language processing and statistical learning techniques, I measure the degree of reasoning in these voting explanations. The preliminary findings suggest that the extent of reasoning depends on the type of defection and the issue salience of the vote. The findings have implications for our understanding of the use of reason in political discourse and legislators' relationships with their party principals.	Legislative Studies

Legislators’ social media profiles constitute a source of unfiltered communication, allowing legislators to strategically deviate from their party line. This strategic diversification of policy supply is particularly important against the background of increasing geo-political polarization: In SMD or mixed member systems, MPs and candidates face ever greater incentives to selectively appeal to the specific needs of their local constituents. Capturing these specific appeals, however, requires that we accurately identify mentions and positional statements on specific policy domains from a large stream of textual data. In this paper, we therefore present a new methodological approach for estimating issue-specific legislator communication from Tweets with respect to both salience and positional strategies. Toward this end, we introduce a two-step approach to context-sensitive policy classification via the machine learning model BERT. Via contextualized and ordered representations of text, BERT is capable of capturing nuanced semantic characteristics. Based on parsimonious manual annotations, this approach sequentially handles the classification of tweets as belonging to specific policy domains (salience) and the classification of positional connotations within these domains. We then illustrate the merits of focusing on the diversification of salience and positional strategies at the legislator-level by focusing on the issue domain of housing in Germany -- a country with pronounced socio-economic geographic heterogeneity and a mixed-member PR system in which most MPs compete for personal votes in specific electoral districts.

While the comparative literature on party systems mostly draws on both text-based and expert placements to analyse party configurations, there are at least two broad strands of literature that face the challenge to combine party positions with voter preference data: the literature on policy voting, and on representation. Here, researchers often rely on voters’ perceptions of parties’ policy positions, as reported in surveys. However, this kind of data is scarce, and often only available for the common left-right dimension, but not for more concrete policy scales. Also, it is known that voter data on policy issues suffers from biases caused by persuasion and projection effects, as well as from differential item functioning. While expert placements of parties are considered to be of very good quality, it is unclear how they fit into voter preference scales. This paper discusses and demonstrates the combination of party positions from different sources with voter preference scales. A simple rescaling technique for party positions from expert placements is shown to perform very well in a spatial model of policy voting. It can be regarded a good substitute if party positions based on perception data are unavailable. This offers many opportunities for comparative researchers interested in policy voting and representation, who are often limited in their research by data availability.	Political Methodology

In the public administration literature, red tape (defined broadly as formalised constraints on bureaucratic decision-making) has been identified as a factor for low organizational performance and employee outcomes. Similarly, performance pay contracts are theorized to induce higher effort levels in public servants. Despite this, why is there a prevalence of red tape and low-powered contracts in developmental state bureaucracies? This paper argues that the general theories of public sector efficiency are based on advanced bureaucracies and fail to account for the specific exogenous constraints faced by developing countries; the elimination of red tape and establishing high-powered incentive contracts may lead to lower performance than the status quo. I model a setting with misaligned performance measures (which are common in developing state scenarios) and the imposition of external red tape as an instrument to make the imperfect measure align more closely with the bureaucrats’ effort and show that in such a case, high-powered incentives such as pay-for-performance compounds the multi-tasking problem.

In contast to current reserach, we analyse this behaviour from a comparative perspective. We argue that firms target policymakers that are at once cooperative and pivotal within a given political system. We asses these arguments with survey data on 79 large corporations across the three largest Western economies: the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The results show that the quality of a firms’ relationship with policymakers is a key factor shaping corporate political strategy. Moreover, the distribution of corporate lobbying across venues reflects national variation in the distribution of decision making powers. In particular, in the US, firms place significantly more emphasis on lobbying their bureaucracy compared to firms in Britain and Germany.	Public Policy Administration

While the reasons for this are often rooted in national dynamics, it is puzzling that in countries with different political economies, minimum wages have become increasingly popular policies. To trace the changing salience of the topic, I conduct a multilingual computer-assisted text analysis by using electoral manifesto data. I show that in the last twenty-five years, statutory minimum wages have become an increasingly important topic for parties across the political spectrum. This effect is particularly pronounced for right-wing parties. A sentiment analysis shows that minimum wages have been discussed in mostly positive terms. Additionally, I use a keyword-assisted topic model to discern the contexts in which policymakers discuss minimum wages and find that how the topic is framed differs between left and right-wing parties. For the former, minimum wages are more closely associated with social security, for the latter minimum wages are often discussed in the context of immigration and social dumping. Finally, in order to inspect the short-term drivers of minimum wage growth in Europe, I use a two-part mixed effects models where I cluster minimum wage growth within countries and within cabinet tenures and find no statistically significant difference in minimum wage increases for left and right-of centre governments. Overall these results suggest that the relationship between centre-left parties as supportive of minimum wages increases and centre-right parties as opposed to hikes does not seem to find confirmation in the European context.

Unlike products such as cars or cigarettes, the characteristics of digital platforms (for example, social media, or AI applications) are mostly left to the preferences of technology professionals and managers. Despite their consequences for society at large, there is little systematic analysis available on the preferences of technology professionals to let unethical or problematic software code be developed. In this research note, I mainly investigate the novel hypothesis that contexts with political accountability strengthen the normative concerns of technology professionals for the societal consequences of their activities. I furthermore test whether technology professionals take more responsibility for their products in functioning democracies than in other, less accountable settings, despite the psychological potential for responsibility delegation to government bodies. Using a comprehensive survey of digital technology professionals across 48 countries (N=30’000), I examine two mechanism. 1) individual attitudes towards government regulation of online platforms, social norms, and the political and regulatory system these developers operate in, 2) topic salience, i.e. whether critical public opinion on AI topics and features affect the attitudes of technology professionals towards placing voluntary scrutiny on AI products in democracies vs non-democracies absent of regulatory sanctions. The study shows several important associations which illuminate the importance of topic salience, and it highlights how the political system, especially its ability to create trustworthy and democratic governance, matter for ethical conduct in technology professionals, and the subsequent deployment of critical digital products.

Evidence from a Survey Experiment	937	This paper explores whether and how frames on European Union (EU) issues/policies that are differently politicised by political parties affect public opinion formation. I argue that the magnitude of the framing effects is not independent of the politicisation of the EU issues. However, the concept of politicisation of the EU consists of two main dimensions – salience and polarisation –, which may influence the effect of frames on public opinion formation on EU issues differently. On the one hand, the salience of EU issues implies that individuals are more likely of knowing and having already a stable opinion on them. On the other hand, the polarisation of EU issues indicates individuals which issues are at the centre of party competition and when motivated reasoning should be activated. To test these hypotheses, I use two vignette experiments that manipulate how citizens react to frames in different contexts of party politicisation of the EU during the campaign for the 2022 Portuguese legislative elections. Each experiment covers EU issues/policies that are selected based on their actual level of salience (high vs low) in the national arena, whereas the degree of polarisation is manipulated. In each experiment, the participants read a lead-in treatment on the level of the salience of the EU issues/policies. The remaining treatments in both experiments will vary in terms of the level of polarisation (high vs low) and the type of frames (positive vs negative). The data will be collected among a representative sample of 2000 Portuguese citizens in December.	European Politics

Focusing on attitudes towards the Europe Union, prior research shows a link between foreign language skills and European identity (Kuhn 2015, Díez -Medrano 2017). These questions are often explored with a focus on direct benefits of actual language skills. This paper proposes an additional mechanism, and argues that foreign language learning and the exploration of other cultures during impressionable years in the language classroom can have a substantial effect on political attitudes.The problem with existing research is that self-reported language skills may be endogenous to attitudes, and language skills are correlated with various other factors that affect EU attitudes. The research design overcomes these challenges by leveraging plausibly exogenous variation in foreign language learning due to education reforms in Scotland starting in 1987 to estimate the causal effect of foreign language learning on political attitudes and vote choice in the Brexit referendum. Using a regression discontinuity design, the results show that voters who started high school immediately after the reforms were substantially more likely to vote for remain compared to cohorts not exposed to the reforms. A difference-in-difference design that compares Scottish cohorts to those in England and Wales also leads to the same conclusion. Preliminary evidence also shows similar patterns in other European countries.	European Politics

First, we present a time-series study focusing on the public support for the radical right party “Alternative for Germany” between 2013 and 2019. Second, we employ a quasi-experimental research design that examines the effect of right-wing terrorism on citizens’ attitudes towards immigrants. Both studies confirm that right-wing terrorism increases public support for radical right parties and their programmatic core positions.

However, nationalism has multiple forms, including ethnoregionalism and cultural protectionism, where the latter includes anti-immigration and anti-ethnic minority appeals. Parties seeking to prioritise nationalism can combine both forms in a variety of ways, and an important determinant of this combination is the EU. The EU is able to shape party appeals by influencing the ease with which parties can achieve their policy- and vote-seeking goals using that form of nationalism. However, the EU’s effect has changed over time, with EU governance reforms from the 1980s encouraging ethnoregionalism, while the EU’s response to the 2008 financial and 2015 refugee crises encouraged cultural protectionism. This paper explores the causal mechanism underpinning the EU’s influence on the saliency of different forms of nationalism by examining Italy’s Lega and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang, which together constitute a typical and most different systems design. Using qualitative process tracing focused on elite interviews triangulated with other sources of evidence, I find that the EU does encourage parties to adjust how they prioritise ethnoregionalism and cultural protectionism, as expected.

While previous research has focused primarily on the determinants of populists' electoral success and its consequences for voters as well as established parties, this article examines the impact of populist parties' government participation on the most fundamental of democratic institutions, the constitution. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, covering information on constitutional changes and populist parties across 30 European democracies (1978-2019), I investigate how the entrance of these actors into power impacts the frequency and content of constitutional redrafting. I argue that populists in power not only commonly engage in projects of constitution-making and constitutional reform, but further pursue a specific agenda with these changes by increasing executive power and decreasing judicial independence. I test my argument using a series of fixed-effects and difference-in-differences models. The findings make an important contribution to the literature on populist parties, constitutional change and democratic backsliding.	Parties and Representation

The incidence of occupational precariousness, however, rose sharply in Western Europe over the past decade; has this rendered the representation of outsiders electorally beneficial? In the article, I address this question by examining the relationship between occupational precariousness and voting in the 2018 Italian election, when a pro-outsider policy stood at the forefront of the electoral campaign of the Five Star Movement. I find that subjective perceptions of precariousness, rather than formal employment status, influenced vote choice by increasing the probability to vote and to support the Five Star Movement, and that the electoral relevance of outsiders has outgrown the relevance of secure workers. These results indicate that outsiders can be effectively mobilized via targeted economic policies and that their representation is today electorally beneficial, thus challenging consolidated assumptions about outsiders' low turnout rate, difficult mobilization, and consequent political irrelevance. Considering the socially transformative power of disseminating evidence that exposes the electoral benefits entailed in the representation of an economically and politically marginalized group, these results entail societal and political, besides theoretical, implications.

Party Rebranding in Europe	426	Seminal work in the political science literature has argued that political parties have brands in the same way as corporations. However, one of the characteristics of a corporate brand is its malleability in that corporations change aspects of the brand by “rebranding.” If party brands are indeed analogous to corporate brands, is it possible for parties to rebrand, and if so, what are the electoral consequences of doing so? In this paper, I argue that parties do rebrand, and that this is done by either changing the party features, such as the name, or party policies. I further argue that these rebrands are an effective electoral strategy, but only for small parties. I test this latter argument on a data set of 245 political parties in 18 European countries from 1945-2019, and find support for my argument. This paper contributes to our knowledge of party strategy, and specifically the tools and actions that parties take when competing with one another.	Parties and Representation

Niche Parties and Social Policy.	465	Niche parties have established themselves in Western European party systems by focusing mainly on culture. Yet, with growing professionalization, these parties start to diversify their issue portfolio. A social policy agenda connected to their core issue – such as a welfare chauvinist programme for the Radical Right and an egalitarian agenda for the Greens – might help to attract new constituents, and to break with their single-issue image without losing credibility on their core issue. However, while some of these parties have been active in promoting a social policy agenda, others have remained almost silent on issues outside their niche. This article investigates how parties’ internal preference distribution affects their divergent issue engagement. It draws on different measurements of intra-party preference heterogeneity using both survey data and parliamentary speeches in combination with Latent Semantic Scaling. The analysis finds that, in contrast to mainstream parties, niche parties engage in social policy issues once they are characterized by higher levels of preference heterogeneity. By showing that niche and mainstream parties deal differently with internal preference heterogeneity, this paper contributes to the understanding of broad appeal strategies, and indicates that niche parties use their blurred position to strategically appeal to new voters.

In some instances, when groups of party supporters prefer the policy stance of the challenger, the established party may be better off expressing dissent or ignoring the challenger entirely. The results highlight that when established parties face new challengers, they must walk an increasingly precarious tightrope, balancing the need for unity with some degree of tolerance for dissent. They also help to explain why mainstream parties accommodate the position of challengers, despite recent evidence in political science literature that doing so can be electorally detrimental.

Pandemics and natural disasters place strain on regimes and their ability to govern, often resulting in increased restrictions on civil society and decreased respect for human rights. Migrant and refugee populations would be the most vulnerable and thus experience elevated levels of human rights violations. We argue that there are two mechanisms that could counteract the desire or perceived need to limit civil liberties and decrease government respect for human rights. The first mechanism relates to state capacity. States with high levels of state capacity will be more likely to be able to absorb these exogenous shocks and be able to function with minimal interruptions to their standard practices. The second mechanism relates to the presence of a robust civil society. Civil society groups can help bridge the gap in government performance relating to the challenges posed by pandemics or natural disasters. Using data on pandemics, natural disasters, and human rights practices within states, including those of migrant and refugee populations, we expect to find much support for our arguments relating to the ability of state capacity and civil society organizations to mitigate human rights abuses.

I argue that despite applying equal standards to all states, the global distribution of accusations does not correspond to actual levels of human rights abuse. The propensity that individual cases of human rights abuse are addressed by the Special Procedures is a function of its information availability that differs systematically both across states and between individuals. I hypothesize that cross-country differences in shaming intensity are shaped by restrictions of domestic civil society organizations that impede the capacities of the Special Procedures to verify information. I also suggest that the Special Procedures are more likely to pick up cases of high-profile individuals such as journalists or professors compared to less salient individuals that suffer from similar human rights abuses. I investigate the theoretical arguments with newly collected empirical data from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UN WGAD). I show a substantial mismatch between country-based indices of political imprisonment and the global distribution of accusations of arbitrary detentions. Drawing on zero-inflated negative binomial models, I empirically analyze determinants of cross-country variation in shaming intensity. I model the selection process of the individuals covered by the UN WGAD by matching them with political prisoner lists from NGOs. I probe the external validity of the results with data from other Special Procedures and the preliminary evidence supports my arguments.	International Relations and Conflict

In the domain of foreign aid, a large literature examines the positive effects of foreign aid on the electoral fortunes of local politicians. When aid is unpopular, however, politicians have incentives to disassociate themselves from the aid. These strategies may be constrained by political affiliations, where populist parties may be able to more credibly deny association with unpopular aid, and expectations of future aid from donors, who politicians may be unwilling to alienate despite the electoral costs of unpopular aid. I develop a theory of the conditions under which blame attribution is possible and credible for local politicians. I then examine patterns of blame avoidance and blame-attribution in social media posts by political incumbents, their opponents, and donor aid agencies in Kosovo. I also identify strategic distribution of popular and unpopular aid projects around elections.	Political Economy

Foreign criticism and news preference in authoritarian states	1275	In authoritarian countries, who reads about foreign criticism of their government? How does this criticism affect views about government performance and the political system? Recent studies have examined whether members of the public show compliance or backlash in response to shaming. However, none have examined who chooses to read about news of foreign shaming, and whether the effects on those who seek it out are different from those who come across it incidentally. In this study, we carry out a modified participant preference trial in China, a country where international criticism of the government’s reaction to the Coronavirus outbreak has been widely reported in local media. The study examines respondents’ preferences over reading about foreign criticism, and then randomly allocates a real-life news story with US diplomatic shaming of the Chinese government’s initial response to COVID-19. We expect that foreign shaming will serve to polarise public attitudes. Chinese citizens who actively seek out foreign criticism will see a backlash, rating their political system and government response to the outbreak more positively. Those who do not seek out criticism will be more likely to use it to update their views in a more negative direction.	International Relations and Conflict

Most analysts associate the hybrid war with its means (cyber, disinformation, violent covert action) depending on perceived vulnerabilities, or the degree of uncertainty (mix of tools and measures, actions below threshold of war, gray zone conflict), exploring various metaphors to explain the key traits of these diverse models. While such attempts provide valuable contributions for understanding modern conflict, they are limited in fully revealing the threat’s nature.In order to better understand war, I propose a different analytic approach, by conceptualizing and introducing the interstate aggression as unit of analysis, of which conventional war is a subtype, among others. Therefore, I suggest to stop using conventional war as the main logical anchor and referential point for interstate violent conflict.In my analysis I intend to explore the analytic tool labeled “contest success function” to better understand their mechanisms, and then contrast and compare three types of violent interstate aggression: conventional war, proxy war, and hybrid war. I will focus on their sought ends, which is to undermine or destroy the sovereignty of the target country, by acquiring control of its territory (and resources), population or ruling elites. Each type of interstate aggression (conventional, proxy or hybrid) uses distinct and different mechanisms to achieve the same goal. I will examine and explain this in detail, building the “conceptual maps” of the three types of interstate aggression, providing evidence and illustration using micro-comparative cases.

Kennedy Institute, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany	p	y	0459	The Diffusion of Anti-Ship Missile Warfare and US Hegemony	66	This dissertation contributes to the ongoing discussion on great power competition in the context of the anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) challenge in the Western Pacific. Advances in precision-strike capabilities by countries that have been considered adversaries or competitors in recent US national security documents threaten the US’s power projection capabilities. Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), as well as anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), can if employed effectively, contest the command of the commons. This changing strategic environment has prompted several commentators and analysts to suggest a US response which implies developing anti-ship missile (ASM) warfare capabilities that can turn around the A2/AD logic to deter power projection by revisionist powers. In contrast to other domains of military equipment, the United States is not so clearly ahead of its European allies in ASM technology. The US’s relationship with its European allies is marked by geostrategic cooperation, on the one hand, and industrial competition, on the other hand. European-made ASMs not only compete successfully against American ones in the global ASM market, but the US is currently also dependent on ASCMs of Norwegian origin. What explains this variation in ASM warfare capabilities between Western countries? Most of the IR literature assumes that military technology spreads easily, especially to a country like the United States with the world’s largest defense industry. According to this view, catching up ought to be easy for the US. I show, however, that the variation in this capability depends on the technological challenges imposed by ASM warfare.

A Disaggregated Study	462	Studies on the effects of cell phone usage on conflict focus on presence vs absence of network and yield mixed conclusions, suggesting the effect might depend on other important attributes of each context. The prominent theoretical expectation is cell phones improve collective action. Meanwhile, communication technologies have been advancing exponentially and the nature of telecommunication has changed. I argue that the richness of the information exchange marked by the introduction of 3G and further network technologies leads to an increase in the military effectiveness of insurgent groups. To test this argument, I focus on Afghanistan as a least-likely case. Analysing the effect of introducing 3G network coverage in existing 2G network areas using spatial models and difference-in-differences estimators, I find that the introduction of 3G network leads to an increase in the number of violent events and in the number of multiple-coordinated attacks perpetrated by Afghan insurgents. Results are robust to different sizes of spatial units and do not suffer from reporting bias.	International Relations and Conflict

Emerging from Britain’s academic discourse and implemented into government policy in recent months, the concept of offensive cyber is likely to have profound ramifications across the expansive digital markets, regional currency, vulnerable industries, and national sovereignty in Europe. My proposal consists of two arguments. First, I show that the concept has many roots in the reality of digital sovereignty, including (1) British solution to the systemic vulnerability of digital space and the experiences of EU partners undergoing cyber attacks, (2) recognition that existing international legal and normative frameworks have been inadequate (I made this point in the Journal of Cybersecurity in 2021), and (3) emerging consensus that a strategy solely relied upon defense and deterrence - common among European nations - is untenable. Second, I consider a range of implications of offensive cyber on the digital economy of EU nations. I show how offensive cyber can exacerbate the European digital space by provoking hackers to go against the economic infrastructure. I will demonstrate how the concept’s proliferation would undermine the digital sovereignty as a whole, increase the number of ransomware and destructive malware operations against vulnerable industries, such as insurance, education, and energy, and weaken the power of the Euro due to the widespread use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies by a series of hackers and government agencies that deploy them on their behalf.
