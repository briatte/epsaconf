It reveals the experimental design by mapping design elements to aesthetic parameters. It illuminates the analysis by plotting the statistical model in ""data-space."" When the design and analysis of an experiment are encoded in a plot, the interpretation of the experimental results is clarified. ""Analyze as you randomize"" is a dictum attributed to Fisher that guides interpretations of experimental data. This chapter extends that principle to visualizations of randomized experiments. While not every experiment requires a visualization, those that do should be visualized in ways that communicate the design and results together.

This increase is justified because citizen forecasting is among the most accurate election prediction methods, and its accuracy extends to subnational units, even when based on small and hence unrepresentative samples. The standard method for combining citizen forecasts is majority voting, which is optimal (minimum possible classification error) when accuracies are equal across citizens. Recently, weighted majority voting has been proposed for two-party systems, which is optimal when accuracies vary across citizens, but are equal across parties for each citizen. I introduce a probabilistic framework from pattern recognition that generalises weighted majority voting from two- to multi-party systems. This framework also includes two additional combiners, and I extend it by deriving another two. In total six combiners are derived subsequently from one another, by progressively relaxing and then eliminating assumptions about citizen accuracy or party accuracy. The framework also highlights that fewer assumptions come at the cost of more parameters to be estimated, which may make non-optimal combiners perform better than the optimal combiner. I apply the framework to citizen forecasting in the British multi-party system. Results from eight general elections slightly favour weighted majority voting, especially for constituencies with few citizens.

Within political science, in particular, there is growing emphasis on bolstering women's presence in the political methodology sub-field. We contribute to these efforts with an intervention aimed at increasing female undergraduate students' interest in quantitative political science at a large southern U.S. university. After discovering that the university's female political science students were less likely to pursue a quantitatively oriented Bachelors of Science degree, we designed a short, female-friendly presentation on the benefits of the degree, which we delivered to a randomly selected subset of discussion sections in an introductory political science course. To evaluate the utility of this intervention, we compare it to an alternative, more conventional presentation delivered to the remaining discussion sections. Our initial results suggest that providing information about the benefits of the quantitatively-oriented major helps close the gender gap in men's and women's likelihood of pursuing such a degree. And, it seems plausible that the female-friendly intervention is especially effective. When completed, this field experiment---which is still ongoing---may provide a low cost intervention that can boost women's interest in pursuing quantitatively-oriented majors.

Our new measure of emotionality in language combines lexicons for affective and cognitive processes, as well as word embeddings, to construct a dimension in language space between emotion and reason. Applying the method to the U.S. Congressional Record for the years 1858 through 2014, we show that emotionality in U.S. politics was stable until the early 1970s, after which time it increased significantly. More polarized politicians use more emotional language in their speeches. Emotionality increased after floor speeches became televised.

Scholars of various courts have demonstrated relationships between judges' voting patterns and the interests of actors responsible for their (re)appointment. However, it is typically unclear if such relationships are (at least partially) explained by judges acting strategically to achieve reappointment or if they are (fully) attributable to selection effects. I exploit a 2010 reform of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to estimate the casual effect of removing reappointment opportunities on judges' independence. The ECtHR bench is composed of one judge from each member state and judges sit ex officio on cases involving their nominating state. Prior to 2010, terms were renewable and judges seeking reappointment were therefore incentivized to favor their nominating states. In 2010, the terms were made nonrenewable with immediate effect for judges serving on the Court. I show that removing reappointment opportunities significantly reduced judges' tendency to favor their nominating states.

Judicial independents is under increasing pressure in European democracies. We (re-)evaluate the publics’ willingness to support highest courts within the European Union, to understand how possible changes in judicial legitimacy link to the publics’ willingness to accept judicial opinions. Subsequently, we analyze whether individuals regard judicial opinions as politically moderate or extreme in comparison to their own political views, while the support for highest courts varies. In order to do so, we administered a survey-experiment in 12 Western and Central Eastern European countries. First, we evaluate respondents’ support for the highest courts using established legitimacy measures. Second, we ask respondents to place controversial societal opinions in a policy space and randomly prime them that those opinions where made either by highest courts or by representatives of the national government; we withhold any priming from a control group. Finally, we compare the placement of respondents to their political self-placement. Our research design allows to assess variation in public support for the judiciary across countries. Moreover, we assess respondents’ perceptions of controversial opinions made by judicial institutions in comparison to other primers. The findings have implications for our understanding of the publics’ reaction to the increasing threat on judicial independence. In comparing findings across countries, we are able to understand whether limiting judicial independence promotes the public rejection of controversial opinions. If this is the case then governments limiting the judiciary potential succeed when increasingly engaging in court-curbing.

A Change in the Decision-Making Procedure and Judicial Outcomes.	750	Judith Spirig	As many courts have struggled with an increasing workload and a backlog of cases, it might come as no surprise that some have implemented a reduction in panel size to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of decision making. Yet, we have only very limited empirical evidence as to if and how reducing panel size affects judicial decisions. This paper leverages a natural experiment at the Swiss Federal Administrative Court to gauge the impact of an effective panel size reduction on asylum appeal decisions. Drawing on fuzzy regression discontinuity design and machine learning approaches, I show that giving chair judges the opportunity to invoke a shorter procedure involving one less judge in the decision of cases ‘clearly with or without merit’ leads to a decrease in the grant rate. Though perhaps particularly consequential in the field of asylum law, this finding draws attention to the importance of decision-making procedures for the consistency of judicial decisions more broadly.

Building on extant literature highlighting the influence of economic conditions on public support for European integration as well as theoretical accounts emphasizing the influence the cost of compliance for a member-state government exerts on the willingness of the European Court of Justice to rule counter to the government's preferences, I argue that poor economic conditions in a member state should correspond to a more deferential Court of Justice. I then extend this argument to account for the level of political competition facing the government by positing that the impact of economic conditions on decision making is conditioned by the electoral strength or weakness of the incumbent. An analysis of all legal issues brought to the Court from 1980 to 1998 in preliminary reference and infringement proceedings finds support for these expectations. Specifically, the Court was more likely to rule against the preferences of the member-state government when economic conditions are poor and the government faces strong electoral competition.

Evidence from Party Candidate Lotteries in Mexico	607	Mathias Poertner	Does political representation increase political participation? Analyzing a natural experiment from Mexico, in which a political party uses lotteries to select and nominate candidates for national public office, this paper presents new insights into how descriptive representation shapes the political participation of underrepresented segments of society. I find that electoral participation in the subsequent elections is significantly higher among constituents who have been represented by randomly selected deputies who closely resemble their constituents in terms of their social background and who are embedded in local organizational networks. Furthermore, I find evidence that these represented constituents feel more empowered and that the party that provides this `grassroots' representation is rewarded, receiving significantly more electoral support in the subsequent election and gaining a strategic boost over its electoral competitors. The findings highlight the importance of descriptive representation for political mobilization and have important implications for debates about democratic inclusion and representation.

As a basis for our contribution, we consider a set of empirical assumptions formulated by Gamson in 1961, namely, Gamson's Laws, which remain at the heart of government formation forecast. Yet, predictions based on Gamson's Laws rarely point to a correct coalition structure and are limited in their ability to predict the power distribution within a government coalition, especially in the case of smaller parties. While the critical resource postulated in Gamson's approach is the percentage of votes obtained by each political party, other versions of Gamson's Laws can be derived based on a different choice of critical resource. We model the coalition formation process as a cooperative game, and provide axiomatic foundations for a version of Gamson's Laws in which the critical resource is identified as strategic influence, as measured by the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953). We compare the empirical accuracy of forecasts based on the resulting Gamson-Shapley theory versus the original Gamson's Laws for a panel of twenty-five different countries in the two most recent election cycles. We find that the Gamson-Shapley theory leads to a significantly more accurate results both in terms of predicting a correct coalition structure and power distribution within a winning coalition.

One of the reasons for this apparent puzzle might be that, under certain conditions, liberal and conservatives differ in their tendency to display motivated reasoning and, as a result, to polarize in response to new information. In this study, we argue that motivated reasoning should be asymmetrical when either relational motives to maintain homogenous social networks, or when epistemic motives to reduce uncertainty are triggered. We test these mechanisms directly in a two-wave survey experiment in which we assigned participants to counter-attitudinal evidence on two salient issues in the U.S. - border control and universal healthcare - combined with novel manipulations of relational and epistemic motives. Preliminary findings indicate that in the presence of ""social cues"" that trigger in-group/out-group motivations, conservatives are more likely to polarize in response to new information than liberals. Besides providing new evidence of how people make up their minds on salient, political issues, this study aims to identify the conditions under which conservatives and Republicans might be more prone than liberals and Democrats to engage in motivated reasoning. By analyzing potential ideological differences, we also aim to shed light on the puzzle of why evidence of attitude polarization seems so elusive, despite a political domain in which “we find bias, bias everywhere” (Taber and Lodge 2016, 82).

Effects of media polarization and fragmentation on political knowledge in five countries	894	Laia Castro	Previous research showed that differences in people’s motivations and opportunities to consume political information can widen knowledge divides within a country (Prior, 2007). However, little attention has been devoted to investigating how citizens’ interactions with their media environments explain political learning gaps across countries. We conduct a cross-national survey in five countries (Denmark, Poland, Italy, US and Switzerland) tapping respondents’ use of different news brands and platforms, and their knowledge of international and national news (N=3920). Our analyses reveal that i) the number of news outlets citizens use is positively linked to their levels of political knowledge, and ii) people need a greater number of news sources in more polarized than in less polarized-fragmented information landscapes to reach similar levels of political knowledge. Accordingly, we also find that the sources citizens use in more polarized settings tend to be more opinion-congruent and are perceived as of lower quality and more biased. Taken together, these findings speak to individuals’ coping strategies to acquire political information in different information environments, and explain why people in more polarized-fragmented landscapes tend to compensate for the (actual and perceived) shortcomings of their media contexts by using more news sources. Overall, our study sheds light on individual and contextual antecedents of political knowledge gaps and adds to our understanding of how more partisan and commercialized media environments can set higher barriers to information acquisition.

Regular, everyday gender stereotypes might be detrimental to women’s political opportunities, as they link women to non-agentic traits.

Because of processes such as decentralisation, regional integration (e.g., European Union), frequent use of referenda and other, more idiosyncratic, institutional change, citizens are required to participate in an increasingly large number of votes. This research investigates the effect of these institutional reforms and practices on electoral participation. Building on the existing literature, we hypothesize that the unprecedented proliferation of electoral contests exerts negative effects on voting rates even in the most important elections and thus contributes to the global decline in voter turnout. We test our hypotheses using three types of analyses. First, we conduct a macro-level analysis of an original and freshly collected dataset covering an exhaustive list of national, subnational, and supranational elections and referendums held in 22 democracies since 1945. Second, we use a quasi-experimental data from the United Kingdom to better explore the causal negative effect of second-order elections on voter turnout in first-order elections. Third, we conduct a multi-level analysis of the survey data from four waves of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. Our research design pays particular attention to the question of causal inference. The findings have implications for a better understanding of the current participation trends, the on-going transformation of democratic citizenship, and the consequences of democratic institutional engineering.

The survey experiment focuses on analysing the effect that different types of clientelist promises have on the vote choice of slum voters. The experiment does this by presenting slum voters with pairs of hypothetical candidates, who vary along four dimensions - party affiliation, (social) caste identity, type of clientelist offer, and degree of coerciveness in the clientelist offer made. Recent elections in India have seen intense criticism of party candidates who have openly discussed elections as a transaction in their campaign speeches. The effect of such 'quid pro quo' statements on the choice of poor voters is less explored than the effect of positive clientelist inducements. In addition to this experimental component, the survey also probes the different types of political and civic participation in which the respondents engage - from party rallies, to community groups - in order to draw further conclusions about the relationship between political participation, clientelism, and vote choice. This study builds upon extensive qualitative work done in the slums of Bhubaneswar (Orissa) that examines how those living in urban slums simultaneously participate in protest politics, mobilise votes, and engage in clientelist negotiations with politicians. The study is part of a broader dissertation project that explores the relationship between political mobilisation by citizens and the institutions of electoral politics.

Why are cities different? In large cities, segregation reduces the probability of contact between immigrants and natives and, hence, it reduces the salience of the immigration issue in the decision of how to cast a ballot. I show that citizens of large cities in France are more likely to vote more for far-right parties in response to immigration when segregation is low. The effect fades away as segregation increases. When the electoral response to immigration is analysed at the polling station level, i.e. when segregation is naturally controlled for, then standard results in the literature appear: (i) more immigration is associated with more far-right vote, (ii) more so if the immigrant population is very distinct from natives, (iii) more so if immigrants compete with natives for welfare.

More specifically, I investigate how economic shocks and social capital jointly affect voting for non-mainstream parties. As shown previously, I expect that economic downturns should favor the electoral success of anti-establishment parties (voting for populist and far-right wing parties). In order to test the effect of economic shocks I employ a novel dataset on layoffs at the regional level (the European Restructuring Dataset). On the other hand, I also expect that social capital (including both generalized trust and a higher density of social networks) should reduce the vote for anti-establishment parties. Especially so when a higher density of local social networks is associated with greater provision of local public goods. In addition, I expect an interaction between these two factors by which regional social capital should moderate the effect of economic shocks on anti-establishment parties. I develop a two-fold strategy to evaluate the empirical implications of my expectations. First, I exploit individual-survey data (ESS Rounds 1-8, ECHP and EU-SILC) aggregated at the European-region level matched with the layoffs regional data. In order to get exogenous variation in social capital measures at the European-regional level I use regional data on family types from Emmanuel Todd as an instrument. Secondly, I also develop a field-experiment in the metropolitan area of Barcelona to evaluate how economic shocks and social capital jointly affect individual voters’ levels of trust - generalized trust, institutional trust and in-group/out-group trust.

In recent decades, a restrictive protest permit system has been used to dampen dissent from Hong Kong and Singapore, to Russia and Kazakhstan. Yet, due to a lack of appropriate data, we still know very little about the effect of the protest permit system on the opposition’s ability to forge broad coalitions in electoral autocracies. Do subtle strategies of repression, imposed through the protest permit system, bolster coordination among ideologically distant opposition groups, or do they trigger a ‘sorting’ effect instead, with opposition groups of the ‘toughest’ sort and highest resolve being more likely to take to the streets, despite repression? And, how does the decision to protest without a permit influence voters' perceptions of the opposition in these regimes? To gain traction on these questions, I rely on unusually detailed, subnational data on the organizers of protest in Russia from 2017 to 2018, combining them with novel survey evidence. Findings, which suggest that the protest permit system may trigger splits among more and less risk-acceptant opposition groups, and dampen voter support for the ‘extremist’ protest organizers, have implications for debates on the changing character of repression and authoritarian resilience.

Some have lamented that much of this democratic backsliding has been engineered by charismatic leaders unchecked by their parties---as the traditional bulwarks of liberal democracy. In this paper, we formally model the interaction between a leader occupying the chief executive and his party. We show that when parties are highly reliant on a leader's charisma to win elections, they grow less able to sanction their behavior in office. This is particularly true in settings characterized by high levels of ideological polarization. This inversion of the power dynamic between parties and politicians increases the likelihood that demagogic politicians are able to enact anti-democratic policies. We seek to test these theoretical predictons using cross-national data on leaders characteristics, changes in the quality of democracy, and autocratic reversions.

We model the interaction between an incumbent politician, an opposition politician, a strategic blackmailer, who has access to \emph{kompromat}, and voters. The incumbent and the voters know that the opposition politician may be compromised and are aware of a blackmailer. The blackmailer can release \emph{kompromat} against opposition politicians. The incumbent can implement a transparency regime, which would make blackmail impossible. We show that she, instead, might strategically opt for an non-transparency regime that would keep the skeletons in the closet as it is easier to run against a maybe-tainted opponent. Our results are corroborated with data from the Global Transitional Justice Dataset.

Yet, the evidence shows that electorates remain largely committed to democratic norms. This paper shows that democratic backsliding can occur even when most voters and most incumbents intrinsically value democracy. Due to voters' reference-dependent preferences, opportunistic authoritarians emerge: against their own liberal tendencies, these leaders choose to challenge norms of democracy (and then partially back down) in order to lower the standards to which voters will hold them. In equilibrium, voters do sanction serious, sudden blows to democratic norms, but electoral incentives do not inoculate against gradual backsliding---in fact, under certain conditions they encourage it. We show that polarization, voter's access to information, and institutional checks and balances all have an ambiguous effect on the occurrence of democratic backsliding.

What is the most successful strategy to induce democratic values, increase political knowledge, reduce authoritarian nostalgia, and mobilise voters to participate in elections? In this study we take Tunisia, a new democracy, which overthrew its dictatorship in 2011, as a case study to investigate these questions. We thereby test the transformative power of social media by implementing an online field experiment through Facebook and Instagram. Young people are recruited through social media and were then randomly selected into three different online courses, which developed original civic education content. Here we test three different learning and persuasion strategies to induce democratic citizenship: 1. Emphasising gain of the democratic system; 2. Inducing loss aversion by pitting autocracy versus democracy and 3. Inducing self-efficacy with non-emotional knowledge transfer. We further use a placebo group, which was exposed to a non-political course. Data was collected using SurveyMonkey to get post-treatment responses on a series of key political attitudes and behaviours. The findings confirm that online civic education can have a transformative effect on democratic citizenship. The research was implemented in collaboration with the head and local office of the DC-based NGO “Democracy International”.

We propose a theory according to which voters trade-off democratic principles for incumbent competence and their willingness to do so is increasing in the incumbent regime's economic performance. We evaluate this theory by examining the rise and decline of the AK Party in Turkey. We combine data on the support for AKP since its founding, a series of original survey experiments, and a case study of the 2019 Istanbul municipal election. Our findings improve our understanding of when and why voters defect from authoritarians they have previously supported.

In order to pass legislation effectively, minority cabinets have to be supported or at least tolerated by non-cabinet parties which in exchange obtain policy pay-offs for their legislative support. I argue that minority cabinet parties have to make fewer policy concessions to non-cabinet parties if they occupy the median position in parliament and if they have strong agenda setting powers. In contrast, I expect minority cabinets to make more concessions if there is a formal legislative agreement with non-cabinet parties. The empirical analysis is based on a new dataset on legislative decision making under seven minority governments in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden between 2010 and 2018. It contains information on the bargaining success of approx. 600 political parties on more than 75 legislative policy proposals. Following the strategy of the DEU-Project (Thomson et al. 2006), the information on the parties’ ideological positions was gathered in semi-structured expert interviews (i.e. MPs and ministers). My findings have important implications for the understanding of minority governance and contribute to the fields of policy making, legislative politics, and party competition.

Extant literature has long been discussed whether politicians increase public expenditure in election years to pander to myopic voters for reelection motives. However, politicians might also propose a bigger public project to persuade voters in election years without implementing it. Such distortion in the policymaking process is not easily detectable with the data of realized policies, e.g. with public expenditure data. This study investigates words without actions using politicians' statements in the assembly minutes and deploy dictionary methods and machine learning techniques. We collect 47 prefectural assemblies' minutes in Japan, from 2001 to 2017, which include 10,372 politicians' statements. We find that politicians' statements follow election cycles: during the election years, politicians temporarily change their statements (e.g., increasing the stated amount of money in suggestive contexts and increasing their mentions of specific locations) in the budget-making process. The effects are larger for those who won a narrower election. We then discuss whether these statement changes involve policy changes, but we find in election years (1) the amount of stated money increases much more than the actual budget, (2) their statements become less consistent with the realized budget both in short- and middle-run, and (3) their effort does not increase. We also find that these changes in words without actions are associated with higher chances of winning in the next election, implying that politicians lure voters with attractive statements without changing their policies.

We thus expect that politicians are more likely to use emotive rhetoric in parliamentary speeches, the larger the general audience. Our analysis covers nearly one million parliamentary speeches held in the British parliament, the House of Commons, in the period from 2001 until 2019. We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary with word embeddings techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary. Our analysis reveals that the level of emotive rhetoric has increased since 2015 with the start of the Brexit debate. Importantly, we also show that emotive rhetoric is more pronounced in high-profile legislative debates, such as Prime Minister’s Questions Time. These findings suggest that politicians use emotive rhetoric strategically to appeal to a wider audience.

The experiments were embedded in nationally representative internet surveys in France, Germany and the UK.

However, when being able to choose their information, respondents strongly select a benchmark that is in line with their prior view of the government. This is in line with theories emphasizing behavioral constraints. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous information acquisition limits political accountability during the pandemic. This effect is likely to be most relevant when political polarization is high.

This contribution focuses on public sentiments concerning the conditionality of unemployment benefits. We exploit a vignette experiment that was embedded with Round 8 of the European Social Survey. Across the set of twenty-three different countries/ survey segments, respondents were randomly assigned different vignettes that characterize the age and family status of benefit claimants who turn down job offers due to lower payment or qualification levels or are unwilling to carry out unpaid community work in return for social transfers. Survey respondents are then inquired whether they support which level of sanctions or cuts to these benefit claimants. Our empirical findings demonstrate that deservingness cues provide strong and robust causal effects. The observational controls, which pick up material self-interest and ideological standings, are also closely linked with the outcome variable. Eventually, these effects are conditioned by the respective national contexts.

This paper provides the first causal evidence of an institutional reform that can remove these electoral advantages and break family legacies. We exploit Britain's Redistribution of Seats Act, mandating the abolition of constituencies below a population threshold. We find little evidence that redistricting affected incumbents' immediate electoral success. Yet those whose seats were abolished were less likely to have relatives entering the House of Commons afterwards. The differences are not driven by fewer immediate successions in the next election, but by having fewer new relatives running and elected over the short-run, i.e. up to 1918. Our paper highlights an understudied long-term consequence of redistricting: increased competition by shifting the distribution of power across generations.

However, while the political science literature paved a rich theoretical way for the study of reputation, we do not know what the origins of reputation are, nor we have an externally valid and comparable measure of reputation across agencies and over time. In this paper I address these two gaps in the literature. I propose a structural theory of reputation, for which agencies with a stronger design – that is, endowed with more independence and competences – are more likely to enjoy a good reputation across multiple audiences, regardless of ideological distances between politicians and the agency. Empirically, I leverage a quasi-experimental setting (diff-in-diff) by looking at the impact of structural agency reforms on bureaucratic reputation in the US. By using word embeddings techniques on congressional debates, I also introduce a novel approach to measuring bureaucratic reputation. The preliminary findings suggest that agencies endowed with stronger structures are more likely to build a good reputation, despite the ideological gap between them and Congress. This paper aims to contribute to the literature on bureaucratic politics both methodologically and substantively, bridging structural and reputation-based accounts of bureaucratic behaviour.

Conflict Avoidance and Delegation Decisions in the Council of Ministers	500	Anastasia Ershova	Delegation patterns in the EU are thought to be defined by a variety of factors such as conflict between principals, peculiarity of legislation itself, and the location of principals’ preferences vis-à-vis each other. However, extant literature does not examine whether decision to delegate power to the agency may have effect on behaviour of the actors in the most powerful institution within the Union, namely Council of Ministers. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by examining to what extent likelihood of different types of dissent in the Council is affected by the amount of power the principals agree to transfer to the agency. I argue that increasing delegation motivates government representatives to signal their dissent. Specifically, I maintain that increasing delegation of power to the agency is likely to boost the likelihood of abstention votes and negative statements the members issue during formal voting stage. However, the power of the agency does not affect the chances of open opposition within the Council as it is more likely to foster underlying conflicts and emphasize non-cooperative behaviour of the actors. The peculiar patterns of behaviour suggests the importance of conflict acvoidance among the Ministers. The paper contributes to both literature on delegation choices in the EU as well as to the studies concerned with the bargaining and signalling games in the Council of Ministers.

To tackle the accusations of a democratic deficit, the EU has continuously empowered its only directly elected institution: the European Parliament (EP). This empowerment culminated with the introduction of the codecision procedure, which has advanced symmetric bicameralism in the EU, making the EP a powerful co-legislator. This study asks whether codecision has also reduced the EU's democratic deficit. In particular, this study examines substantive democratic deficits, by measuring the responsiveness of EU policies to European public opinion. The article leverages text data of 75 directives and regulations in social and employment policy between 1990 and 2008 as well as post-stratification of European public opinion during the same time period. It uses a differences-in-differences approach and crowd-sourced ideological scaling of EU social and employment policies in order to causally identify the impact of the introduction of codecision on the nature of policy responsiveness in the EU.

A comparative analysis of resettlement policies in the OECD countries	813	Lea Portmann	Across the Western world, countries have restricted their refugee admission laws and stepped up their border control policies to prevent refugees from reaching their territory. At the same time, the resettlement of refugees has become increasingly popular. More states have introduced resettlement schemes, and many have raised the number of resettled individuals. Why do states decide to voluntarily admit refugees while increasing their efforts to deter asylum seekers? We explore this puzzle by investigating the determinants behind countries' decisions to admit refugees by resettlement. We argue that resettlement has an important instrumental function for liberal democracies: Resettlement preserves the humanitarian commitment of states and thereby legitimizes an ever more restricted access to asylum. The argument is tested with a comparative analysis of resettlement choices by OECD countries between 1980 and 2018. The results confirm that the opening of resettlement channels is combined with the closure of borders to prevent irregular entries. This finding bears important implications for global asylum governance and responsibility-sharing.

One of the factors that is yet to be fully examined is the variation among peacekeeping troops at the local level, and its impact on peacekeeping effectiveness. Specifically, peacekeeping troops greatly vary across two dimensions:\ unit types, e.g. infantry, engineering, aviation etc., and their country of origin. We argue that different unit types greatly increase peacekeepers' specialization in skills and equipment, improving peacekeeping effectiveness in reducing battle-related deaths. However, we also argue that this effect is strongly moderated by cultural diversity among troop contributing countries (TCCs), i.e. linguistic and religious distance, which exacerbates coordination problems among troops. We conduct semi-structured interviews with current and former UN peacekeepers to probe several theoretical mechanisms. We then test the propositions derived from our theoretical discussion using new subnational peacekeeping data, Geo-PKO (Cil et al. 2019). Using matching and a difference-in-difference design, our analyses on UN peacekeeping bases across Africa from 1994 to 2014 shows that force structure at the local level significantly impacts peacekeeping effectiveness.

I argue that arms transfers solve a critical problem arising from shaky alliance commitments. If a protege is worried that it will be abandoned by an ally in the future, it may initiate a preventive strike in the present to entrap its ally in war to capitalize on the benefits of joint military action. Thus, unstable alliances result in war because they give rise to a dynamic commitment problem. Arms transfers act as a substitute for an ally's direct support. As a result, arms reduce a protege's reliance, and soften the blow of expected abandonment. Thus, they eliminate the incentive for entrapment and result in peace. To illustrate this, I develop a formal model in which a defender, protege, and challenger interact repeatedly over time. When the defender's future commitment to the protege is certain, arms transfers are not necessary. However, when the defender's commitment is likely to wane, arms transfers may occur in equilibrium, as they prevent the protege from initiating a war of entrapment. This explanation provides insight into patterns of arms transfers that are not well explained by existing theory.

Bilateral linkages and rebel attacks on peacekeepers	204	Katharina Pfaff	Peacekeeping missions put the life of peacekeepers at risk. Rebel group attacks on peacekeepers are relatively frequent, and over the past 30 years, 3,096 men and women involved in various United Nations-led missions have been killed. This article examines whether a perceived lack of impartiality of peacekeepers vis-à-vis the host government affects deliberate attacks against UN personnel of a particular country. Assuming that rebels attack peacekeepers as an intermediate strategic goal to undermine incumbent regimes, I argue that rebels are more likely to attack peacekeepers from countries with an alleged pro-government-bias. Rebels resort to this strategy as close economic and military linkages between the country contributing peacekeepers and the rebels’ home country increase strength of the government and thus decrease the rebels’ balance of power against the incumbent regime. In targeting representatives of the main supporters, i.e. peacekeepers of the supportive foreign government, rebel groups intend to weaken their home government. I test these hypotheses using a country-year sample on attacks against peacekeepers in sub-Saharan peacekeeping missions between 1991 and 2009. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression estimates provide preliminary empirical support for the role of economic linkages which is robust when controlling for mission-speciﬁc characteristics.

The activities of peacekeeping operations and its effects on election violence	121	Hannah Smidt	How can United Nations peacekeeping operations (PKOs) mitigate election violence in war-torn countries? Elections can support the transition from war to peaceful politics; but they also give rise to new uncertainties and may trigger violence. While an increasing number of PKOs is mandated to assist elections, there is no systematic study on how PKOs impact election violence. I argue that we need to distinguish between PKOs with and without election-related activities to understand the impact of their deployment on election violence. Only if PKOs actively assist with organizing and securing elections, can they address the election-specific incentives for violence. Using novel data on PKOs' election-related activities and accounting for endogeneity in both PKO deployment and activities, the analyses of 445 elections in conflict-affected countries (1990-2012) confirm this expectation. PKOs only reduce the risk of election violence if they adopt election-specific policies. This finding holds for different control variable strategies, and when accounting for election assistance by other international organizations. The results imply that the design of peacekeeping is crucial to manage political transitions from war.

Empirical analysis provides limited evidence in support of these explanations. However, model predictions show that these theoretically-informed models match real-world observations fairly well.

While previous studies have established that malnutrition has serious and lasting negative consequences on individuals' health, education, and labor market outcomes, very little is known about its effects on individuals' political views later in life. This study represents an initial effort to investigate the long-term political consequences of in-utero exposure to malnutrition on demands for social insurance. To this end, we leverage the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944/1945 as a natural experiment given its severity, suddenness, and clear temporal and spatial boundaries. We link rich administrative data to present-day public opinion data from the Netherlands. Using a difference-in-differences framework and causal mediation analysis, we examine whether in-utero exposure to famines increases individual demand for social insurance later in life.

After pointing to its theoretical and empirical shortcomings, I suggest that nationhood, as understood today, was linked to an emancipatory project – the construction of a “liberal” order – that was universally attractive. In those states where a “liberal” or “bourgeois” revolution succeeded, the old world of monarchical courtiers, corporate interests, and social estates disappeared, replaced by an abstract society of politically equal individuals (as defined in Cochin, Furet), and political borders became congruent with national identity. By contrast, in those states where the liberal revolution failed (or happened late in time), the preservation of spatially-defined barriers (inequalities) led to a break between the (old) center and one or more national peripheries or communities. I test the hypothesis by looking at the evolution of the political identity of Jews across American and European countries over the 19th century, complemented with a regression discontinuity design that exploits the differential political treatment of Polish and Russian Jews under Tsarism.

Some explanations to this phenomenon emphasize cultural legacies; others focus on political and labor market institutions to explain. We investigate the joint effect of culture and institutions on the political representation of women. To gain leverage on cultural traits, we focus on two prototypical historical family types: nuclear vs. stem families. In nuclear families, newly-weds started new households and women stayed at home, while in stem families the newly-weds stayed with in-laws, grandmothers did more housework and young females were more likely to be in paid work. As a result of female participation in the market economy, women in stem families gained bargaining power vis-à-vis men relative to women in nuclear families. Our hypothesis is that in-household gender equality shapes attitudes about women’s active participation in politics. To estimate the causal effect of family types on female political representation, we apply an instrumental-variable strategy based on medieval inheritance laws, using historical and contemporary data for Spain. Our preliminary findings show that regions with a tradition of stem families elect more female councilors in local elections than areas where nuclear families dominated. Then, we assess the role of cultural norms, labor market institutions and political institutions (in particular, the adoption of gender quotas in party lists) in the evolution of the gender gap between regions with different historical family types during the democratic period (1977-2015). To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings for theories of cultural persistence and change.

Yet, existing research has, at this stage, failed to assess to what extent candidates’ character traits also play a role. To take an obvious example, it seems natural to imagine that candidates as opposite as the bombastically extroverted Donald Trump and the shier, yet punctilious Angela Merkel do not campaign in quite the same way. Indeed, character traits have been shown to be powerful drivers of political attitudes and behaviors in both the public at large and elected officials. In this article, we bridge the gap between existing work in political psychology and political communication and study to what extent the personality traits of competing candidates are linked with their use of negative campaigning strategies. We rely on candidate surveys in six European countries: Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. Data includes candidates’ self-assessment of the “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness) as well as self-reported measures of their campaign tone during the last national election. Controlling for the usual suspects driving negative campaigning strategies at the candidate level, we expect that a negative tone is more likely for candidates scoring low in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, but high in extraversion.

We rely on candidate surveys in six European countries: Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. Data includes candidates’ self-assessment of the “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness) as well as self-reported measures of their campaign tone during the last national election. Controlling for the usual suspects driving negative campaigning strategies at the candidate level, we expect that a negative tone is more likely for candidates scoring low in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, but high in extraversion.

One aspect of this phenomenon is that misinformation often comes from unknown sources that conjure the impression of professionalism. Little is known about the individual characteristics underlying susceptibility to such fraudulent sources. We use data from an original survey experiment that tests the role of sources (known vs. unknown), channels (Facebook vs. website) and content (congruent vs. incongruent) on people's beliefs and sharing of information. We investigate which groups are most susceptible, first, to the source effect, that is, the tendency to believe and share information more from a known than from an unknown source; and second, which groups are more likely to believe and share from a source that has previously provided them congruent information. We apply recently developed machine learning methods based on random forests (Wager and Athey 2018) to tease out heterogenous treatment effects over a wide range of covariates. We find strong heterogeneity on some variables (e.g. age, vote choice, education), but less on others (e.g gender).

At present, the relationship between candidate gender, nonverbal communication, and voter impressions during debates is significantly understudied. We still lack a general understanding of how gender may moderate the influence of agonistic (competitive) and hedonic (bonding) displays by televised debate participants on evaluations of candidates by voters. In this study, we ask to what extent counterstereotypic gender behavior among political elites during televised debates influences real-time voter impressions of political candidates. We conceptualize emotive signaling as occurring through three different channels: nonverbal (facial displays of emotion), vocal (speech pitch), and verbal (sentiment of speech). Using four full-length debate videos from three German federal elections (2017, 2013, 2009), we employ computer vision, machine learning, text analytic, and statistical methods to automatically extract second-by-second measurements of political candidates' facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. After validating our computational approach, we combine second-by-second emotions data with continuous response measures of support for candidates recorded by live audiences, which have been collected by the German Longitudinal Election Study. Controlling for viewer political attitudes and demographic characteristics, we examine whether multimodal emotive displays by female candidates during televised debates influence real-time levels of support from the viewing public.

Surprisingly, research on the agenda-setting power of parties and the media remains scarce and inconclusive. Only few studies analyze whether and to what degree parties respond to changes in media issue coverage or whether parties can set the issue agenda in the news. However, the answer to this question is fundamental to understand parties' responsiveness and changes in the issues they focus on. We compare issue salience in the traditional media, social media, and agenda setting by political actors by applying an extensively validated supervised machine-learning classifier to about 400,000 articles published in 84 Swiss newspapers in 2018 and 2019, 350,000 tweets on Swiss politics posted in 2019, as well as all press releases by Swiss parties in this period. We use these data and methods to test whether parties communicating on a specific issue are more likely to influence media and social media coverage on this topic. Specifically, we focus on climate policy and women's rights, two issues that emerged prominently on the Swiss political agenda during our observation period, and which were widely perceived to prompt some parties to redefine their positions facing the national elections in 2019. The findings have important implications for the literature on social media, party competition, responsiveness, salience, and issue ownership.

Citizens’ Preferences for Online Hate Speech Regulation	418	Simon Munzert	In the age of social media, the questions of what is allowed to say and how hate speech should be regulated are ever more contested. We hypothesize that content- and context-specific factors influence citizens’ perceptions of the offensiveness of online content, and also shape preferences for action that should be taken. This has implications for the legitimacy of hate speech regulation. We present a pre-registered study to analyze citizens’ preferences for online hate speech regulation. The study is embedded in nationally representative online panels in the US and Germany (about 1,300 respondents, opt-in panels operated by YouGov). We construct vignettes in forms of social media posts that vary along key dimensions of hate speech regulation, such as sender/target characteristics (e.g., gender and ethnicity), message content, and target’s reaction (e.g., counter-aggression or blocking/reporting). Respondents are asked to judge the posts with regards to their offensiveness and consequences the sender should face. Furthermore, the vignette task is embedded in a framing experiment, motivating it by (a) looming government regulation protecting potential victims of hate speech, (b) civil rights groups advocating against censorship online, or (c) a neutral frame. While governments around the world are acting towards regulating hate speech, little is known about what is deemed acceptable or inacceptable speech online in different parts of the population and societal contexts. We provide first evidence that could inform future debates on hate speech regulation.

We argue that local-level party system institutionalization similarly mediates the link between the economy and vote choice. We focus on one dimension of party system institutionalization: the strength of party-candidate linkages in elections, measured by manually tracing the rerunning patterns of some 80,000 candidates in Indian state elections 1986-2007. Using rerunning patterns to measure party-candidate linkages and rainfall data to measure the state of the economy, we show that voters are more likely to reward incumbent parties for economic performance when parties and candidates are aligned in consecutive elections. We address concerns of endogeneity in rerunning patterns by showing that the results are robust to alternate measures of local-level party system institutionalization. They are also robust to alternative measures of the state of the economy, and using individual-level survey data.

We argue that moderate or mid-range responses when individuals are asked about their personal financial situation are more likely in multi-person households than in one-person households. Using data from the American National Election Studies from 1966 to 2016, we find that personal financial experiences are a very good heuristic for the assessment of national economic conditions. More importantly, we show that personal economic experiences are endogenous to household size. The aggregation of personal economic evaluations within households reduces the variation across household members, and therefore it is harder for an individual to say that her personal financial situation is good or bad in multi-person households. The main implication of our analysis is that economic voting in advanced societies is expected to be stronger in one-person households and over time, given the downward trend in the average number of household members.

Prior research shows that electoral participation is crucial to realizing such congruence, at least in terms of a left-right policy ideological dimension. We expand the theoretical and empirical lens of inquiry to address two important challenges. First, in an era in which voting and institutionalized participation have stagnated or declined, we conduct a broader investigation that includes both electoral and non-electoral participation. Second, in recognition of the increased salience of policy dimensions beyond the left-right policy axis, we investigate citizen-government congruence for multiple policy dimensions. The study builds on recent research by Stecker and Tausendpfund (2016) to integrate data on citizens’ policy preferences and political behavior from the European Social Survey (2008 & 2012) with the 2010 Chapel Hill Expert Survey’s data on European party positions (e.g., European integration, redistribution, social lifestyle, immigration, environment).

Yet, growth economists propose that technological change is the main driver of long-term growth. In this paper, we thus build a theoretical argument focusing on institutional features that should affect technological change, and that may do so through a) increasing the number and variability of new ideas introduced in the economy and b) improving the efficiency with which the best, new ideas are adopted. More specifically, we highlight that institutions and guarantees of rights that promote gender equality and female empowerment should improve on both the variability and selection of new ideas, and thus promote long-term economic growth. We test various implications of this argument using extensive data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem project) to measure variation in gender equality and female political empowerment, including civil liberties protection, political inclusion of women and female participation in civil society. Drawing on information from across 183 countries and 225 years we find robust evidence that female empowerment is positively related to subsequent economic growth, even when accounting for initial differences in economic development, democracy levels, and country-fixed effects. The relationship is retained across different contexts, but is stronger for “Non-Western” than “Western” countries. When disaggregating the sources of economic growth, we find clear evidence, in line with our argument, that female empowerment enhances productivity growth, a proxy for technological change.

Protest against austerity during the Great Recession	595	Chendi Wang	In response to the recent economic crisis in Europe, governments across Europe implemented austerity. An influential view claims that austerity does not entail significant political risk. But this research , solely focusing on elections, misses an equally important form of resistance, i.e. protest in the streets. I test the impact of austerity announcements by studying the protest level during the Great Recession. I assemble a novel time series cross-sectional data-set for monthly public economic protest and policy decisions from fiften European countries and treat austerity packages as intervention variables to the underlying monthly protest series. Applying advanced time series methods, my main empirical contributions are twofold: first, I show that austerity do drive people to the street; second, I demonstrate that the magnitude of this impact and its temporal dynamics are contingent on the political and economic context. Under certain conditions, the short term and long-term impact of austerity is dramatic: in instances of rising magnitude of both objective and subjective economic grievances, lower political capital of the government, the proximity of elections, and the involvement of external creditors, the impact of austerity is much larger.

Collaboration of women in parliaments is one way through which descriptive representation of women translates into substantive representation. I expand the analysis of bill cosponsorship that has been conducted in the United States (e.g. Bratton and Rouse, 2011) and Argentina (Barnes, 2016) to European countries. I use a unique dataset of cosponsorship data scraped from the archives of several European parliaments including Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Belgium and the Czech Republic, taking advantage of the broad range of electoral systems, quota regimes and levels of women’s representation present in these countries. The results show that women are more likely to collaborate with other women in situations when they are marginalised in the legislature, while men begin to collaborate with women at higher levels once women achieve a substantial share of the seats in parliament. Most importantly, the electoral system has a different effect on collaboration for male and female politicians: While men are more likely to collaborate with women in systems featuring single member districts, women are more likely to collaborate with each other in mixed systems. These results show how the institutional setting of a parliament influences the strategies female politicians can use to represent female voters.

These arguments are important as when corporations lobby alone instead of through a business association, they enjoy both the advantaged position that business interests have compared to other organized interests and are able to mobilize quicker compared to when lobbying via a business association. This could lead to more fragmented pressure systems. What is more, when corporations go alone as a result of conflict with the business association, they tend to focus on issues that are more self-oriented and less moderate. When lobbying on low salience issues, the scope of the issue tends to be smaller, meaning that corporations have more leeway in getting their way. Previous research has addressed drivers at organizational, sector and structural level. This paper adds an issue perspective to above explanations. The two arguments are as follows: corporations are more inclined to lobby alone on 1) low salience issues compared to high salience issues in order to decrease visibility so that the odds of facing public scrutiny are kept at a minimum, 2) when levels of conflict between the corporation and business association on an issue increase as the corporation is less content with the business association and therefore seeks other modes of interest representation such as going alone. The arguments are tested on a 2x2 survey experiment among corporate lobbyists in Germany and the Netherlands.

Grundmanns	University of Mannheim, Mannheim	p	0114	Do Constitutional Courts write their opinions differently under public scrutiny? Applying NLP methods to uncover argument structure in judicial texts	1066	David M. Grundmanns	How does public scrutiny affect the opinion-formation of highest courts? Established scholarship shows that public opinion impacts the outcome of judicial decision-making. However, while the focus rests with outcomes of decisions, the impact of public scrutiny on the whole opinion-formation remains puzzling. This is why I present a novel approach to assess the causal effects of public scrutiny on opinion writing and the quality of decisions taking judicial opinion-formation serious. In particular, I introduce the analyses of argumentation structures from natural language processing to judicial politics. The written decisions of courts are segmented into internally coherent argumentative units which constitute the opinion formation of the court. For each segment I assess the deliberative and argumentative quality of the court’s ruling based on length, complexity, use of precedence and similarity to written briefs. I argue that oral hearings increase public attention and moderate the interaction of judges, petitioners, political and societal actors participating in hearings. The broader attention introduced by oral hearings incentivises judges to improve the deliberative quality of written opinions. Thus I expect courts to argue each point of the discussion in more detail, making use of more precedence cases and literature to support their argument and addressing briefs more closely. To test my argument, I apply my approach to the whole text of decisions published by the German Federal Constitutional Court between 1972 to 2019. The court is a role-model for many highest courts with constitutional review powers and hearings are a common feature of court’s decision-making.

Weighting addresses non-response associated with measured variables, but may exacerbate non-response bias associated with unmeasured factors. Selection models correct for non-response related to measured and unmeasured factors, but often prove unreliable for conventional survey data when no variable can credibly be assumed to affect response but not the outcome of interest. This paper presents survey techniques that generate the information needed to make selection models function properly. First, by randomly treating potential respondents with questions that affect response propensity, we produce a variable that explains response, but does not affect outcome variables directly. Second, by eliciting behavioral willingness to respond to political questions independent of the content of response, we can directly assess the relationship between response willingness and outcomes. Results from surveys using these tools demonstrate their simplicity and potential for identifying substantial non-response bias, especially among partisan subsamples.

Evidence from Conjoint Experiments across Europe.	1183	Eri Bertsou	Scientific knowledge and sector expertise is the backbone good policy, which can yield good governance outcomes. Nevertheless, very little is known about citizen views of experts and expertise in political decision-making. Do citizens welcome experts? Do certain policy issues boost citizens' approval for expert involvement? And what precise role do citizens envision for experts in the policy-making and decision-making processes? The paper addresses these questions using a novel battery of survey data and a conjoint experiment about expert involvement in politics. It finds that independent experts are preferred relative to elected politicians in the designing and implementation phases of policy-making. For the decision-making stage, decisions made directly by the citizens through referenda is preferred, but the elected representatives and independent experts are evaluated equally and this holds for a variety of technically complex and social issues. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the current role of representatives in democracies and the demands for more technocratic and participatory processes.

Establishing the impact of these messages is particularly salient given growing efforts (and concerns) about the roles of messengers in politics through campaigns or fact-checking on digital platforms that often prioritise visual components. We provide descriptive evidence examining whether factual information about the economic impacts of immigration on the UK matters for a variety of British immigration attitudes and policy preferences. Using a survey experiment (N=3,889 UK-based respondents), we provided identical economic information as a text-only treatment, as a series of three charts accompanied by the same text, and as an infographic video accompanied by a narrator reading the text. All three messaging modes reduced negative immigration attitudes (even when looking at Leave and Remain subgroups). We also find suggestive evidence that, at the aggregate level, charts were marginally more effective than video at changing policy preferences. We conclude by pointing out that further research exploring differences among visual modes is warranted, and—importantly for testing theories of affective polarisation—the treatments (which presented positive arguments) did not ‘backfire’ to produce more negative attitudes.

It is often assumed that people are aware when MPs are doing so, and that focus affects attitudes towards the MP, because MPs can offer evidence of their focus via the local media. However, the UK is seeing growth in ‘media deserts’, areas without effective local newspapers to cover the MP (Ramsay and Moore, 2016). In the United States, Hayes and Lawless (2015, 2018) show that this affects constituents’ ability to evaluate the local member. In media deserts, we might therefore expect the link between a member’s constituency focus and attitudes to the MP to be weaker, or even non-existent. I test this relationship using a high-quality proxy for constituency focus – talking about the constituency in the House of Commons (Kellerman, 2016) – and recent British Election Study data on perceived constituency focus and trust, alongside the Ramsay and Moore (2016) classification of constituencies according to the presence of significant local daily newspapers. I show that perceived constituency focus and trust have a statistically significant positive association with ‘real’ focus, but there is no such relationship in media desert constituencies. Thus, media deserts may reduce a) the incentive to demonstrate focus, and b) the potential accountability of MPs who ignore their constituencies. This may add to the case for support for local media, as the British government is exploring (Cairncross, 2019).

While recent scholarship has demonstrated multiple effects of trade shocks, far less attention has been paid to unbundling the mechanisms through which import competition affects political responses on compensatory and trade policies. In this paper, we assess the possibility that an important part of the political effect works through local economic institutions – labor unions – that shape the relative strength of workers in the policymaking process. We study the US House of Representatives to untangle this institutional channel from other channels. In our empirical analysis we leverage two distinct sources of exogenous variation: an instrument for import competition drawn from the literature and a novel instrument for district-level union membership based on history and geography. We use them in a new semi-parametric approach to disentangle causal mechanisms. We find that (i) import competition lowers district-level unionization, (ii) weaker unions lead to less legislative support for compensating economic losers as well as less opposition to trade deregulation, and (iii) the union channel represents a large fraction of the overall effect of import exposure on legislative votes. We show that results are robust under alternative specifications and when accounting for possible local violations of exclusion restrictions. These findings have important implications for the political economy of globalization. They suggest that the political impact of globalization is broad with lasting consequences for civil society and democratic politics.

Yet, while most previous works have focused on the bargaining process between early representative assemblies and the monarch, we do not know much about how legislative actors behaved during these power voids. We contend that elites in early representative assemblies used these power struggles to signal their sovereignty over the realm. We empirically examine this logic using the activity reported in the XVII century in the Journals of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, two of the longest established representative assemblies in the world. In order to capture the power of both representative assemblies, we implement a novel strategy based on entropy of topic shares in daily records of parliamentary activity. Our findings show that elites in both representative assemblies strategically used power voids in order to signal their sovereignty preferences and eventually extract concessions from the Monarchy. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of early legislative assemblies and provide a new way of measuring institutional power through the analysis of text.

While a vast literature examines the spillovers of female representation on political peers and citizens, we know little about upstream spillovers. I examine this question using the natural experiment of as-if random assignment of gender reservations in the world’s largest local elections in Delhi. I find that each additional increase in local female representation more than doubles the % of local female candidates that contest state elections and the likelihood that local and re-contesting state-level female candidates and incumbents secure party nominations. Consequently, female vote-share doubles. A conjoint experiment confirms that voters in local female constituencies prefer female candidates in state elections. Local female representation has upstream spillovers because it increases women’s influence within parties and enables cross-level gender co-operation, even when local representation is quota-mandated, and over shorter time horizon than widely assumed.

A formal model examines the concession the President can obtain by granting a visit. The President does not want to visit leaders who will not be around to implement agreements. Hence, a US diplomatic visit signals that the US believes that a leader is secure in office. This signal deters domestic adversaries. Empirically a visit with the US President reduces the risk of leader deposition by 50-70%. A game theoretic model explores how diplomatic visits can help prop up friendly leaders and extract concessions from others. The model characterizes the size of optimal concessions, the optimal investment in intelligence to assess survival prospects and contrasts the efficiency of diplomatic visits with aid or direct intervention.

In foreign aid, there is copious evidence that more women in parliament lead to not more but also higher quality foreign aid allocations. However, we lack examinations whether the purported mechanism, that women legislators have different preferences in aid upon which they act, actually is at play. In this paper, we introduce not only a novel conjoint survey experiment to examine electoral incentives of legislators in the context of foreign aid depending on gender, but also reexamine several different areas of legislative behavior for evidence that women legislators prioritize foreign aid more. Specifically, we analyze roll call votes, inquiries with bureaucracies, co-sponsorship, and expressed attitudes at parliamentary hearings about foreign aid. Our analyses in the U.S. Congress since the 1970s suggest that there is no evidence to be found that women legislators behave differently in the context of foreign aid. We conclude by proposing ways to reconcile existing and our findings.

This paper presents a model of proxy war with two governments and two militias in which governments delegate conflict by sending non-negotiable offers to militias. Offers are composed of monetary transfers and of a sharing rule of political influence. Armed groups are positioned along a continuum representing the ideological misalignment between each militia and its government sponsor. I study a principal-agent model with two principals and two agents and characterize the optimal contracts under complete and incomplete information about the militias’ ideological positions. The analysis shows that with incomplete information armed groups receive lower transfers but are left with higher political independence. When governments strategically choose whether to fight by delegation or engage directly in conflict, I show that equilibria can be characterized in function of the local support to militias. If governments compete to recruit the same armed group, the militia carves out higher rents and pledges allegiance to the government ideologically closer.

Research shows that the underrepresentation of the working class matters in terms of policy processes and outcomes. Yet, the research on class has largely focused on blue-collar representatives, who are primarily men. Working-class women are more likely to hold pink-collar jobs, or low-status occupations dominated by women. We argue that pink-collar legislators are uniquely positioned to legislate over redistributional policy. To test our argument, we combine a new coding of working-class backgrounds that accounts for pink-collar representation with bill introductions and state spending data on education and social services from U.S. states over time. Modeling compositional budget data, we find that class and gender intersect to shape policy outcomes via state budget allocations, with women’s pink-collar representation associated with increased spending on both education and social services.

In fact, this topic has been a defining block of their ideology and their self-conception. Recently, social democratic parties have been struggling electorally even more than other mainstream parties. We argue that one crucial piece in the explanation of this phenomenon is that they no longer are seen as the most competent to deal with economic inequality and redistribution. In particular, challenger parties on the fringes of the party system have become stronger on these issues. Both left and right-wing populist parties put a lot of emphasis on questions of social justice and the defense of the “small people” in their discourse and are thus seen as challenging traditional social democratic parties in their core topic of competence. Without this core reputation, it becomes difficult for social democratic parties to attract votes as we know that issue competence is a central factor in explaining party choice. We test our argument with newly collected comparative survey evidence on the perceived competence of parties to handle economic inequality (14 countries) and accompany this data with earlier CSES data (2006-2011) on perceived competence for the most important topic. We explore not only which parties are seen as most competent but also the consequence of these ascribed issue ownership has for party choice.

While research opening up the ‘black box’ party has started to pick up pace in recent years, the vast majority of empirical studies in research areas like party competition, coalition governments and voting behaviour still treats parties as unitary actors. Data on preferences of party factions or even single politicians are still scarce and usually only include single countries or even individual parties, making comparative work challenging. This paper presents the first version of a novel data set on intra-party preference heterogeneity. Our data provide valuable insights into the heterogeneity of preferences within parties, future research will be able to use them in a broad range of contexts concerning the determinants and effects of intra-party preference heterogeneity. We use textual data from Twitter, a social media platform popular with politicians where they can publish direct and unsolicited political statements with little party control, to estimate the ideological positions of members of parliament using quantitative text analysis. As data from social networks are very noisy, this step is preceded by exhaustive data cleaning and sorting out of non-political content using a machine learning algorithm. Covering a total of more than 20 European countries, we estimate the positions of all members of parliament with an active Twitter account on a latent policy scale.

How political and economic contexts affect nomination of candidates with immigration background	457	Anna-Lena Nadler	The rising number of immigrant-origin populations across European democracies makes the question about their political representation increasingly important. Previous research however suggests that ethnic minority populations remain politically underrepresented. Scholars have argued that immigrants' political underrepresentation is mainly a direct consequence of political parties' procedures of candidacy nomination: political parties have acted as gatekeepers and decisively influenced the representation of minority groups. Under what conditions do political parties nominate ethnic-minority candidates? Maintaining that parties' primary objective is to maximize vote shares, I argue in this paper that the public policy context defining immigrants’ political rights influences parties’ nomination strategy of minority candidates. Using data from Switzerland, I provide evidence that political parties’ selection of immigrant-origin candidates is indeed a product of strategic calculations regarding parties’ net electoral gains when reaching out to immigrant voters. These strategies are heavily constrained by the political and economic context. I show that policies which define immigrants’ political rights through alien enfranchisement and access to citizenship are important incentive mechanisms for political parties to nominate minority candidates. Moreover, I present evidence that positive effects of immigrant enfranchisement and liberal naturalization policies on minority nomination are offset in contexts of economic insecurity where political parties consider a potential native backlash.

Representation in the digital age	728	Stefanie Bailer	Social media are a useful tool for politicians to express their opinion and to signal to voters what they care about. Without the intermediary of the media politicians can directly communicate to voters how constituency-oriented they are. We argue that politicians use social media to strategically signal localness especially in election times and when the electoral system offers incentives to cultivate a personal vote. We use a newly collected population sample of all 1.37 million tweets of elected national MPs in two parliamentary systems (Germany and Switzerland) over a time period of 10 years (2009-2019). We analyse these historical Twitter data with a detailed registry of geographical names and combine this with detailed biographical information on these politicians and their career stages. This design allows us to analyze the use of local cues over the whole parliamentary career. Our findings suggest that politicians indeed strategically use local cues at crucial stages in their careers and that this has implications on how we see the democratic value of social media.

In particular, why do high-income citizens pay taxes even in the absence of auditing institutions? What explains the fact that actual tax compliance is higher than the level identified as a fair norm by experimental researchers? In addressing these questions, we propose a distributive logic of tax compliance. We argue that beyond arguments about the monitoring ability and the efficiency of state institutions and normative concerns for the worse-off in society, the distributive incidence of the public sector over the long run drives the level of compliance. We test the argument on the basis of a series of lab experiments in which subjects are randomly assigned to different fiscal treatments that approximate the variation in the design of national fiscal systems around the world. We find significant evidence that the distribution of net benefits (as determined by the progressivity of taxes and transfer) impacts levels of tax compliance.

We use historical aerial imagery of the aftermath of the United States’ indiscriminate firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 to generate detailed neighborhood-level data on damages—helping us to overcome the methodological challenges of nonrandom assignment and coarse measurement. Decades after the air raids, the most heavily damaged neighborhoods continued to suffer socioeconomically—with higher crime, lower educational attainment, and higher unemployment. Causal mediation analysis reveals that these patterns cannot be explained by the ratio of new residents or the construction of high-rise buildings, and a geo-coded survey featuring behavioral experiments indicates less altruism in affected neighborhoods. In contrast to previous studies that stress how violence might affect social cohesion (positively or negatively) through individual or family-level trauma, our findings suggest that community-level exposure to violence might create persistent legacies by displacing victims and altering the urban landscape, thereby fragmenting local communities.

In this paper, we study a model of electoral accountability and policy-making with a hierarchy consisting of a voter, a politician, and a bureaucrat. The politician and bureaucrat both produce government output valued by the voter. The voter can then choose to reelect the politician, while the politician can expropriate some of the bureaucrat's output for his own ends. We show that when times are conducive to high quality governance -- budgets are large and players are farsighted -- incorporating the bureaucratic layer of the hierarchy makes for weaker accountability standards. However, when times are tough and budgets are small or players are myopic it is possible that voters may benefit from increasing their demands on elected officials. These accountability standards change even when reelection does not depend at all on the bureaucrat's output directly.

However, it is not clear how these changing dynamics of revealing preferences affect contentious processes beyond initial mobilisation. We argue that in conflict settings, previously shared social media posts indicating political loyalties can pose a severe risk for civilians. For example, anti-regime messages or display of digital support for the opposition may prove to be life-threatening in government controlled areas. Civilians are likely to strategically alter their social media usage with changing local dynamics of conflict. Drawing on the Twitter activity of users inside Syria between 2013 and 2016 we show how the creation of new accounts and the deletion or disuse of old accounts is empirically linked to changes in territorial control by the armed groups operating across Syria. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the risks - and the potential for civilian agency - when using digital communication in civil conflict.

Foreign Aid and International Incentives for Women's Rights in Dictatorships	185	Daniela Donno	International democracy promoters now treat elections and women’s rights as “bundled norms:” states’ performance is evaluated, and rewards distributed, in response to compliance on either dimension. Dictatorships that fail to make progress toward electoral competition can therefore attempt to camouflage their noncompliance by introducing advances in gender equality; and such measures are often entirely consistent with the perpetuation of autocratic rule. We term this strategy ‘obfuscation,’ and we present a theory that identifies the conditions under which incentives to obfuscate are strongest. Using a new dataset of de jure advances in women’s rights in 130 countries from 1996-2015, we show that dictatorships have been active in passing gender-related legislation, at a rate that surpasses democracies in the developing world. This is driven by variation in international (Western) economic and social pressure: in autocracies, aid dependence and international nongovernmental organization (INGO) shaming is associated with legal advances in women's rights, but not with advances in electoral liberalization. In democracies, however, aid dependence is not associated with women's rights legislation, suggesting that this is a strategy that is more pronounced in dictatorships. Our account therefore demonstrates differences in how autocracies and democracies respond to international pressure, and highlights the potentially perverse consequences of issue linkage in international regimes.

The Trump administration recently strengthened the sanctions measure to counter terror globally. How do sanctions work as part of counter-terrorism? More specifically, are they effective in reducing terrorist attacks? We assess the effects of counter-terrorism sanctions by looking at the trend in terrorist attacks before and after the sanctions imposition by the United States with the designation of Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). We argue that the effectiveness of counter-terrorism sanctions in reducing terror attacks crucially depends on the adaptability of terrorist organizations. The adaptability comes from the diversity in initial financing sources, ranging from private donations, criminal activities, state sponsorship, and terrorist networks. More diverse source of funding guarantees the resource shifts, such as Al-Shabaab moving from charcoal sales to civilian taxation and the Islamic State moving from oil trade to antique trade. The resource-shifting adaptability has consequences for attacks since sanctions would have limited effects on terrorist attacks. To test our idea empirically, we trace the adaptation to sanctions in three generations of the FTO groups, the first generation before 9/11, the second generation of Al-Qaeda affiliates, and the third generation of Islamic State affiliates. We also provide a statistical test of a global sample of terrorist groups between 1990 and 2007 estimating the effect of adaptability on the counter-terrorism sanctions effectiveness. We find, in most cases, sanctions are ineffective because terrorists adapt. The finding have important implications for sanctions as a counterterrorism tool.

However, we know little about what motivates return to conflict-affected areas. Previous research has shown that local communities hit by violence undergo a process of social transformation resulting in greater social cohesion. We argue that when weighing the decision to return, displaced persons must consider this new social reality brought about by the violence. Those that express a willingness to return should be more prepared to engage in collective coping and to act altruistically towards members of one’s own community. Return to conflict-affected areas may also put returnees back in harm’s way, however, and those that were the targets of direct violence during the fighting should be less willing to return, particular if they suffer posttraumatic stress. Those that do wish to return should have experienced greater posttraumatic growth. We term this the “congruence hypothesis”, which we test using a large-scale experiment among displaced persons residing in Turkey. We elicit refugees’ distributional preferences in both the ingroup and outgroup domain. Our unique design allows us to distinguish between nine possible preference types, enabling us to identify the precise preference pattern associated with the willingness to return. We find that refugees displaying altruistic social preferences towards ingroup members, but not outgroup members, express a much greater willingness to return. We discuss the implications of our findings for the encouragement of voluntary return and possible consequences for post-war reconstruction and social cohesion within and between groups in the aftermath of violence.

We exploit a unique feature of the Norwegian electoral system, where parties can, via allocating preferred ranks, affect the degree of list flexibility.

Previous research suggests that perceptions of public opinion are often distorted. However, it remains unclear (1) why reelection-seeking elites mis-estimate constituent preferences, and (2) how to overcome distorted beliefs. I argue that elite misperceptions result from differential exposure and social projection. First, inequalities in political voice generate distorted images of the electorate by making some voter signals more accessible than others. Second, representatives systematically overestimate support for positions they endorse. I find evidence in line with these arguments in a panel of Swedish MPs covering two decades of elite beliefs. Additionally, a novel experiment with Swiss elected officials reveals how promoting a more balanced exposure to voters and avoiding social projection reduces misperceptions. The results contribute to our understanding of democratic representation and uncover ways to bolster the links between voters and their representatives.

Most of the current literature on negative partisanship was developed in two-party systems where it is often presented as a by-product of positive partisanship. However, there is growing evidence that negative partisanship is also prevalent in multi-party systems; and that it is distinct from positive partisanship. In this paper, I explore experimentally what consequences negative partisanship has for political behaviour in multi-party systems. I argue that negative partisanship increases vote switching by changing how voters evaluate all parties on offer, not just the one they feel the strongest dislike towards. I test these ideas using a survey experiment conducted in Canada. I find that priming voters about negative partisanship has an effect on party evaluations, and that this effect is not just limited to those voters who also have high levels of positive partisanship. This suggests that negative partisanship has important implications for political behaviour, even in multi-party settings. Negative partisanship is not the mere by-product of positive party identification but has powerful consequences of its own.

Although a number of attempts have been made to date to develop bot detection technologies, their applicability in social science research remains limited due to issues of transparency, replicability, flexibility, scalability, and suitability for retrospective analysis. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a new supervised learning based methodology of bot detection that integrates state-of-the-art transfer learning and network embedding techniques. We utilize the RoBERTa language model and the Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding (SINE) model to extract informative textual and network features for the purpose of bot detection on the development set, and use these features to train and cross-validate probabilistic classifiers on the training set. We build an ensemble classifier using Bayesian model averaging on top of these individual probabilistic models. We illustrate our methodology by detecting and evaluating the role of bots in a large collection of political tweets posted during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Our methodology can, however, be reproduced and tailored to other contexts of interest.

Personalization is measured as extent to which individual Commissioners or Members of the European Parliament receive attention at the expensive of the respective institution. To test whether there is a positive association between personalized news coverage and trust, the paper draws on two data sources: 1) 511,723 newspaper articles gathered from seven left-leaning broadsheets in seven EU countries and 2) aggregated data from Eurobarometer surveys that measure trust in EU institutions on a biannual basis between 1999 and 2016. Personalized coverage is assessed by automated content analysis using Python and weighed by the distance to the dates of the fieldwork. Controlling for unemployment, GDP growth, immigration, and a lagged dependent variable, the findings show that there is a strong positive relationship between personalized news coverage and trust in the European Commission; it is weaker with regards to the European Parliament. The findings have important implications for the debates about the EU’s accountability deficit.

Recent findings demonstrated that hate speech prosecution decreases democratic support for a large group of citizens (authors, 2018). The effects are primarily influenced by agreement with ideas spread by the politician, rather than by identification with the politician/party. However, previous research has only been conducted in the Dutch context, where political ideas are generally perceived as more important than party identification. Furthermore, many Dutch citizens believe that free speech should be restricted when being hurtful to groups of people. A cross-cultural study between the Netherlands and the United States provides a great opportunity for testing if the mechanisms hold, as 1) political parties/politicians in the US are hypothesized to play a larger role, due to the two-party system, and 2) free speech is more protected in the US compared to the Netherlands. We conduct a web experiment in the Dutch and American context (N=1200, data currently being collected). Participants are asked to read a news story: The Dutch story refers to a Dutch politician from an anti-immigration party, and the American story refers to a Republican senator who openly expressed strong anti-immigration attitudes. Participants are randomly assigned to one of four conditions: two experimental conditions where the independent variable (the decision to (not) prosecute the politician) is manipulated and two control conditions; one with a reference to hate speech but without mentioning prosecution, and one with a neutral news story. Afterwards, we measure participants’ democratic support.

Halpern et al., 2019). Using social network analysis across 4 social media forums (Twitter, Facebook, Instagrama and Whatsapp, we find that people tend to filter out real news and share fake news. Our two-step experiment suggests that people do not invoke their analytical capabilities when sharing news. Instead, partisan affinity as well as their social networking (discussion of politics, and internet usage) strongly predicts news items they share. However, when asked to assess news, analytical thinking matters and there are no significant differences between people from different parties. Since people normally do not have the time to cross-check and analyze the validity of the news items they encounter, they tend to make a lot of mistakes when it comes to sharing fact-checked items. Indeed, fake news infects networks more so than true news, and most worryingly of all, everybody shares fake news.

On the contrary, we know very little on the extent to which public opinion influences political campaigning. The new channels of communication that are social networks allow parties to adapt very fast to specific situations. Nonetheless, I am not aware of any research that yet questioned the reverse causality in the study of political campaigns. In this paper, I try to fill this gap by studying digital communication of parties and politician during direct democratic campaigns. By using a panel cross sectional dataset, this research tries to investigate the effect of public opinion polls on parties??? communication during political campaigns in Switzerland. The direct democratic context gives the opportunity to study the same actors on different topics and analyse their responsiveness. The results suggest that, not only parties and politicians communicate more when they align with their electorate, but also that they adopt a low profile when their position is not in line with their electorate.

The goal of this paper is to understand how this transformation of economic decision-making in Europe may have impacted the economic voting behaviour of electorates at the national level. What may happen to economic voting if citizens of Eurozone countries understand that economic decisions are increasingly decided upon at a supranational rather than national level? We seek to answer this question using novel data from two representative online surveys that were implemented simultaneously in Germany and Greece in January 2019. These two countries were selected since they exhibit some diverging performances in the last twenty years in the Eurozone. We present a comprehensive vote model where the importance of economic perceptions are first presented as a baseline. Then, economic perceptions are interacted with the degree to which citizens perceive that the EU is responsible for economic policy. We will also differentiate the results according to whether the individuals have more or less political information, through readership of newspapers. The reason to do so is due to the fact that the importance of the EU for economic responsibility may impact to a greater extent on national economic voting in conditions of greater information. We expect those who are more informed about the consequences of supranationalisation of politics to be more aware of its impact on the ability to hold the government accountable for economic performance.

Second, the extant literature equates lack of constraint with political ignorance, but how many seemingly “ideologically innocent” voters know “what goes with what” yet choose to flout these norms? When we measure political beliefs and knowledge of ideological norms separately, it becomes clear that ignorance and pragmatism are typically conflated. Third, does constraint facilitate accountability or does it just represent strong adherence to ideological norms? Using a survey experiment, we find that priming norms increases adherence. This suggests that the most ideologically constrained are the strongest norm followers and perhaps not best suited to ensure accountability.

Yet, less evidence exists about how this in turn affects voting behavior. This study exploits a newly constructed georeferenced municipal-level dataset of European Parliament election results in 11 western European countries from 1994 to 2019 to explain the surge in public support for Green parties. We combine georeferenced data on floods and other extreme weather events, obtained from the European Environmental Agency and the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (CRU-TS 3.25), with election returns data. We estimate models for Green party vote shares in each European Parliament election as a function of temperature anomalies and of the distance of the municipality from the recorded location of a flood. Given that the occurrence of an extreme natural event is plausibly exogenous with respect to voting behavior, we can estimate reduced form (intention to treat) causal effects of climate-change related events on support for Green parties. We also use data on climate concern from the Eurobarometer, locating respondents at the level of NUTS2 regions and attributing to them their region’s weather and flood variables. We find that experiences of natural disasters and extreme weather events trigger support for Green parties. In addition, corroborating the reduced-form evidence, we find that individuals who reside in regions more affected by temperature anomalies and floods are more likely to consider climate change and environmental issues as policy priorities.

We find that experiences of natural disasters and extreme weather events trigger support for Green parties. In addition, corroborating the reduced-form evidence, we find that individuals who reside in regions more affected by temperature anomalies and floods are more likely to consider climate change and environmental issues as policy priorities.

By the 1980s the North-South economic divide was coupled with a political divide between a poorer Labour voting North and a more prosperous Conservative voting South. By 2019 the richest region, London, was the most Labour voting. This paper develops various theories that may help explain these developments, especially regarding the social consequences of economic divergence for inter-regional migration and intra-regional inequality. Hypotheses are tested using a mixture of macro-regional and micro-individual level survey data over time. The analysis and results will be important for understanding how economic geography may affect political developments in other high-income democracies.

Why and when do established democracies succumb to such threats? I argue that extraordinary events can give party leaderships of policy-seeking political parties in polarized societies an opportunity to select populist candidates who can help their party gain a qualified majority in the legislature required to dismantle horizontal checks and balances. Such democratic backsliding can enable that party's leadership to lock in their ideal policy. Yet, reduced checks and balances also enable populist incumbents to subvert democracy completely, thereby pushing the party leadership out of policy making processes. Impeachment through supermajorities in presidential systems and votes of no confidence through absolute majorities in parliamentary systems can constitute a credible threat against a populist incumbent's opportunism. But uncertainty about the fraction of the latter's loyal adherents in the legislature can undermine it. I develop a Markov game which shows that party leaderships may still have incentives to gamble on democratic subversion despite such uncertainty. Polarization between political parties reinforces leadership incentives to dismantle checks and balances. Heterogeneity of policy preferences within political parties reduces them. Most strikingly, parliamentary democracies are at higher risk to get dismantled than presidential ones. Once a presidential democracy has become a backslidden democracy, however, it is more vulnerable to full subversion than its parliamentary counterpart.

Candidate Selection under Limited Supply of Female Candidates	1424	Marco Radojevic	The candidate selection process within parties is a critical stage for the descriptive representation of women. This internal process within parties is the main gatekeeperin the recruitment of women as candidates. In this paper I argue that due to the limited supply of female candidates party selectorates may face trade-offs in the candidateselection process: Party selectorates may have to choose between maximizing descriptive characteristics (e.g. Gender), electoral, and ideological concerns. To model thesetrade-offs I employ a conjoint experiment, presenting over 1400 state level party leaders in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with the choice between randomly generated candidatesfor a party list. I show that left-wing and center party leaders value the descriptive representation of women as decision making factor dynamically depending on the absolute level of descriptive representation of women. The worse women are represented, the stronger effect of gender on the candidate selection. This interaction between the level of descriptive representation of women and the strength of gender on the candidate selection does not exist among right-wing respondents.

To test this hypothesis, we study the consequences of national primary school curriculum reforms in Mexico from 1960 to the present. Our research design combines automated text analysis of the entire corpus of textbooks used in Mexican primary schools from 1960 to the present, with difference-in-differences estimates of the impact of textbook reforms on long-run political attitudes and behaviors. The preliminary analysis suggests that the content of textbooks that adults were exposed to during primary school indeed shapes their contemporary political attitudes and behaviors. Our study helps refine our understanding of the mechanisms and conditions under which education promotes democracy.

Among the various mediums available to political parties to appeal to voters, the scholarship has focused primarily on election manifestos, and the policy appeals parties make within them. In this study I argue that in order to better understand parties’ appeals to voters, we should evaluate not only their policy appeals (what parties say) but also demographic appeals (who they say it to). Further, I argue that we should not only focus on election manifestos but also on other election campaign materials such as posters, flyers, leaflets, and pamphlets. Using a unique dataset of parties’ manifestos and non-manifesto campaign materials in Israel and the Netherlands between 1977-2015, this paper shows both the variation in type of appeal made by parties within- and between these two countries, and also the variation in appeals found in manifestos and other campaign materials. It emphasizes the importance of diversifying the materials we use to analyze parties’ behavior and the importance of expanding our understanding of parties’ appeals to voters.

Government-opposition dynamics in MPs’ speeches in Latin America	754	Jan Schwalbach, Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti	Legislative representatives are central figures of democratic systems. Their behavior has a decisive influence on policy outputs and thus on the entire political process. In turn, the behavior of individual MPs is significantly shaped by the institutional context, which differs significantly between presidential and parliamentary systems. Comparative analyses, however, largely focus on parliamentary systems and case studies often study the US system. We argue that especially government-opposition dynamics do not travel to Latin American presidential systems due to the differences in legislative-vs-executive relationships. We hypothesize that MPs from governing parties will be less united in parliamentary debate and less coordinated with the executive in presidential systems. We also expect MPs from governing parties to be more critical to the executive in presidential systems, since there is no principal-agent link. In order to test our theoretical expectations, we scraped and structured all parliamentary records from Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Peru for more than 25 years. This novel dataset of full-text annotated speeches not only opens up the possibility of comparing four presidential democracies over a substantial period of time. The common language allows comparable analyses with text-as-data approaches. We apply sentiment analysis to measure the tone of opposition and governing parties vis-à-vis presidential executive dynamics. Furthermore, we test whether the tone of parliamentary speech varies across the presidential (electoral) cycle. Our results have important implications for our understanding of how MPs in presidential systems behave and to what extent this depends on country and time-specific factors.

These differences manifest in disagreements over the powers for regional governments, particularly in unitary states with devolved powers. We propose that parties incapable of managing an internal consensus on prominent issues such as devolution will attract less electoral support from regions with distinct independence movements. To test predictions from this perspective, we combine supervised analysis of speeches from party national conferences in the UK with survey evidence from the British Election Study to predict voters’ support for national parties in devolved settings. We use supervised machine learning approaches to estimate differences in preferences over regional powers using a new dataset and corpus of party conference speeches from the UK 1997 – 2018.

We expect to find that when the national UK parties disagree over regional issues that Scottish and Welsh voters will be less likely to vote for them and perceive the parties as more divided.

Our results indicate that the executive's going public is not always associated with observable success—indeed, sometimes failure is guaranteed—and, yet, better choices are likely given the existence of the going public option relative to a hypothetical world without it.

Theory and Evidence from Conjoint Experiments in India and the UK	7	Mats Ahrenshop	Electoral accountability for corruption has been shown to be generally weak. However,we still know little about why this is the case. I propose a novel argument to explain thispuzzle. Just how weak accountability for corruption is depends on the salience ofcorruption to voters, and how salient corruption is depends, in turn, on an individual'sincome. I test this explicitly political economy argument in conjoint experiments andwith large-N observational survey data to measure the salience of corruption and itseffect on vote choice, moderated by individual income. Results from India and theUnited Kingdom imply that there is a purely material self-interest side to corruptionvoting. Voters do not punish politicians for corruption when corruption is not salient tothem, and this depends on whether they are rich or poor.

In the past two decades, both democratic and authoritarian governments have adopted freedom of information acts (FOIA) that enables citizens to ask for specific information of their interest that the government holds. Many scholars studied why governments pass the legislation that subjects them to greater scrutiny. However, studies exploring what citizens seek to know once they have the legal right to do so are scarce. Understanding the public demand for government information is essential for assessing if FOIA is implemented as intended and fulfils its democratic oversight function. I study the public demand for the UK central government’s information using the data from Whatdotheyknow.com, an online participation platform for submitting information requests. Using unsupervised learning techniques, I analysed the texts of all information requests sent to the central government bodies through this platform since its start in 2008 to the end of 2017, over 37 000 requests in total. I explored the proportion of the topics within these requests and if the government is more likely to reject the requests on some topics than others. I found that the majority of requesters are pursuing information in their private rather than public interest. These results suggest that FOIA is used differently than initially intended, but also point to the systematic failures of certain public bodies to respect other citizens’ rights.

Yet, criminal organizations often expand to states with strong capacity and well-functioning institutions. This paper proposes a theory accounting for this phenomenon. I focus on one distinctive feature of strong states: their capacity to enforce political and economic competition. I argue that criminal organizations take advantage of highly competitive environments and expand by offering political and economic actors critical resources to gain an edge over competitors. I test this theory in the context of Northern Italy, a region with high social capital and well-functioning democratic institutions, but which has suffered of mafia infiltration since the 1960s. I construct a new municipality level measure of mafia presence, scraping mafia-related news from historic newspapers and validating them with present time mafias indicators from judicial sources and NGOs. My main result, obtained using an instrumental variable approach, is that increases in competition in the construction market (due to a construction boom) and in mafias’ capacity to offer cheap illegal labor (by exploiting migrants from mafia-controlled areas in the south) allowed them to expand to the north. Mafia infiltration impacts politics in the long-run: infiltrated cities display higher support for the Christian Democracy, even when political scandals (Tangentopoli) hit the party and later for Berlusconi. This evidence suggests that mafias’ expansion leveraged deals not only with economic actors but also with political actors, including vote buying for specific parties.

In the process, the CJEU defines legal rules which guide the future decision-making of national courts adjudicating conflict between domestic and union law. What we know little about is how the CJEU decides on the appropriate level of specificity of these legal rules. Determinate rules promise to guide the future decision-making of national courts in cases with underlying facts very similar to the case at the heart of the preliminary reference procedure. Less specific rules promise to apply to a wider set of cases before national courts, albeit leaving national courts greater flexibility in interpreting the implications of the CJEU’s rules for their own actions. In this paper, I develop and test a formal model of the CJEU’s rule-making in preliminary reference procedures. The model identifies how existing precedents previously established by the CJEU as well as constraints faced by national courts when adjudicating conflict between domestic and union law shape the CJEU’s choice of rule specificity. The formal model’s empirical implications are tested using the text and metadata from the CJEU’s judgments in preliminary reference procedures between 1997 and 2018.

In this paper, we trace the complexity of EU policies from the days of the European Communities up to the present day and investigate the extent to which various rounds of EU enlargement and treaty revisions have impacted upon the complexity of the EU’s secondary legislation. Our analysis is built on a novel index of policy complexity that relies on a computer-based measurement approach, covering textual aspects of technicality, indeterminacy, institutional differentiation and density. The original dataset contains information on the complexity of the initial policy proposal and final text of all decision-making procedures available in the EUR-Lex database, aggregating data of more than 50,000 legal texts nested within approximately 30,000 legislative procedures between 1965 and 2019. Our data thus allow us to assess how policy complexity varies over time as well as across legislative procedures and policy areas. At a theoretical level, we hypothesize that, controlling for policy-specific factors, the evolution of policy complexity should be jointly driven by power shifts in the EU’s institutional architecture (treaty revisions) and changes in the number of veto players (enlargement). The paper has important implications for comparative political science, as it provides us with a broader understanding of the ways in which political institutions shape the complexity of public policies.

The Use of Blue-Card Questions in the European Parliament	1188	Verena Kunz	In many parliaments around the world, legislators can use interventions to spontaneously react to their opponents' views during the debate. Such interventions, called blue-card questions, have been introduced in the European Parliament in 2009 to increase interaction during plenary debates. However, we currently know little about how Members of the European Parliament use these blue-card questions given that in contrast to national parliaments, there is no formal government and opposition in the European Parliament. Instead, governing coalitions tend to form on an issue-by-issue basis. To further our understanding of the role that blue-card questions play with regard to government-opposition dynamics, I perform a network analysis based on a novel data set of all 5,496 blue-card questions and answers in the 8th European Parliament (2014-2019). The preliminary results show that the blue-card interactions follow the patterns of the governing coalitions. In addition to contributing to our understanding of party competition in the European Parliament, the findings also provide insights into the interaction of its legislators and the dynamics of legislative debate.

Conflict creates an increasing demand for female participation outside the home, and as a result disrupts traditional gender hierarchies. As such, civil war may create “war-induced female empowerment” and cause a shift towards more gender-equal roles. What happens to these changes once wars end and men return, however? This question has been studied in the context of Europe and the U.S. post-WWII, but has rarely been adopted to the context of civil wars in developing countries. The present study sets out to explore the causal relationship between civil war and gender roles by leveraging the arbitrary Burkina Faso – Côte d'Ivoire border, remnant of West Africa's colonial past, as setting for a quasi-experiment. Comparing the participation levels of women living close to the border pre- and post-conflict, I find that Ivoirian women's likelihood to participate in the labour market or in family planning decisions is reduced by 33 percentage points and 7 percentage points post-civil war. Thus, in contrast to recent studies highlighting the opportunities conflict opened up for women, my results imply that the situation for women became even more disadvantageous after the First Ivoirian Civil War.

The Impact of Third Country Resettlement on Terror Occurrence	676	Meredith Winn	Past studies have found a link between refugee-hosting and increased levels of both domestic and transnational terror. However, these studies have not examined the potential heterogeneity of the refugee-hosting experience. In particular, third-country resettlement programs provide vastly different circumstances and infrastructure for the hosting-state as well as refugees. This paper adds to the understanding of security in the face of forced migration by accounting for third-country resettlement independently of other types of refugee-hosting. Using a global sample, I find that while an increase in refugees in a state is associated with an increased risk of terror, the expected number of terror incidences decreases when states participate in third-country resettlement programs. In other words, while previous findings that refugee-hosting is associated with increased number of terror incidences, there is no evidence that countries who voluntarily resettle refugees see similar effects. In fact, these countries experience fewer terror attacks.

The formal monopoly of the Commission over the introduction of legislative initiatives obfuscates the influence of other institutional actors in the agenda-setting process. This research examines the ability of the EP to shape the EU’s legislative agenda through its use of own initiative resolutions (EPOIR) and explores the variables that increase or impede their relative impact. Utilizing a new dataset of all EPOIR between 2000-2017 that includes data on EPOIR type and saliency, as well as information on the rapporteur related to experience, ideology and links to national governments, we demonstrate the extent to which EPOIR are able to influence Commission legislative proposals and when they are more likely to do so. Our analysis distinguishes between ‘agenda setting’ and ‘content shaping’ influence, as well as efforts by the Commission to use the existence of EPOIR simply to signal support for its initiatives. Through this research we are able to demonstrate that the legislative influence of the EP is not limited to the amending of proposals during the OLP, but in some cases includes agenda setting through its use of EPOIR.

The literature on international agreements teaches us that governmental decisions to adjudicate disputes are strategic, as governments anticipate their odds of success and the signals to key audiences. Yet, while in the WTO context, governments target trade barriers over which they have no (direct) influence, in the EU setting they are usually directly involved in bargaining over the legal acts that subsequently trigger legal conflict. Since the bargaining stage affects both the governments’ preferences over annulment, and their chances to succeed, under which conditions will governments choose to request annulment by the CJEU? This paper argues that governments face a strategic tradeoff between showing commitment to domestic interests and picking winnable cases in order to avoid publicly visible legal defeats. Governments strategically balance their public commitment to policy positions against the legal strength of their case. Pivotal governments can strike a more robust balance than governments with outlying preferences, with important implications for their selection of cases and odds of success in court. I systematically test my argument on a dataset of the universe of EU legal acts, covering more than 130.000 observations. I apply recent methods to address zero-inflation (most acts never experience annulment requests) and governmental coordination in requesting annulments. The findings contribute to debates in the literatures on EU judicial politics as well as international cooperation in the EU and beyond.

While winning and losing in terms of policy outcomes at the domestic level is legitimized via direct electoral competition over political leadership, within the EU context this direct electoral link is obfuscated. This project aims to understand the effect of perceived procedural fairness (here understood as the extent of voice) on decision acceptance and legitimacy beliefs within the EU. By combining observational and experimental analyses, we show that increasing procedural fairness mitigates the negative effect of loss on decision acceptance and legitimacy beliefs, and also that individual covariates, such as positional uncertainty or knowledge, moderate this effect. These results have important implications for ongoing debates in EU politics, especially concerning the so-called democratic deficit.
