2019	86598	1157	Broadening the Scope: Process, Negative Cases, and Short-Term Factors in the Study of Electoral Reform	Research on electoral reform has focused on cases where there is a significant change in the electoral system. Explanations are centered on the interests of political agents or on exogenous variables, such as external shocks. However, this approach is limited: there are other dimensions of the electoral law (like campaign finance or media coverage) that have an impact on elections results; the selection of cases introduces a bias in the results, leaving institutional stability unexploited; and there is a set of variables of the political process that can influence the results. This paper analyzes the impact of these variables on the electoral law reform process, understanding it as a 5-step procedure. The Portuguese case is studied between 1999 and 2015, in which different governments tried to approve (without achieving) reforms in the electoral system, but in which several substantial changes were made to the financing mechanisms and to the media coverage laws. This study explores the nature and timing of the proposals, of the previous reform processes, as well as short-term factors.	Ricardo Carvalho	NA
2019	78993	80	A Socialist Threat? Radical Party Entry, the Formation of Electoral Alliances, and the Introduction of Proportional Representation	A dominant strand of literature holds that proportional representation was introduced by a fragmented camp of established parties facing an electorally strong and ideologically radicalized socialist party. However, the mechanisms proposed by Rokkan and Boix have not been investigated on the micro-level to date. I focus on Imperial Germany as a most likely case for the socialist threat approach. I employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of a socialist candidate entering runoffs on non-socialist alliance formation and vote share. I demonstrate that the entry of a socialist to runoffs substantively increases the propensity of established parties to forge alliances. In addition, I show that the vote share of the non-socialist candidate increases when alliances are formed but not if alliances are absent. The results question the internal validity of Rokkan's and Boix's approach and contribute to the literature on the introduction of PR and the impact of radical parties on electoral competition.

2019	85712	549	How much does fairness matter to voters?	Many observers see “fairness” as an important criterion held by citizens for judging elections and election rules. Reformers often seek “fairer” outcomes, while attempts at electoral gamesmanship by politicians (e.g., gerrymandering, altering eligibility to vote rules) are criticized as “unfair.” Fairness, then, is viewed as a valuable and positive attribute of elections. Actions labeled unfair are seen to be incompatible with the electoral process even if that action would serve to advance the individual’s partisan self-interests. Previously, we showed that dedication to electoral fairness is often malleable, with partisans frequently voicing less opposition to reforms they have previously evaluated as unfair when those policies would benefit their party. But when reminded of fairness norms, citizens may walk back their inclination to support unfair reforms for partisan gain. It may therefore be possible to recover the usefulness of fairness as a criterion for judging elections. Using a series of experiments, we find little evidence that this is, in fact, the case. Voters persist in seeing elections through a partisan lens, even after being reminded of the value of fairness.	Shaun Bowler	NA
2019	85454	490	Dynamic Party System Fragmentation	Although most new democracies have a relatively high level of party system fragmentation, many of them experience a reduction in the number of parties over time. In Brazil the number of parties has increased significantly since the first election after the 1988 constitution, even though no significant institutional change has taken place. Existing explanations of fragmentation cannot account for this. We use data for seven elections at the national and state levels to show that the increase in fragmentation observed in Brazil is due to the entry of new parties and the denationalization of the party system. The latter process results from the uncertainty marginally competitive candidates face regarding their post-electoral position in the party list. This induces them to move to smaller parties which, given the rules, are able to make the chance of election at least as high as in the larger party. The increasing number of strong candidates running under smaller labels leads to the progressive denationalization of the party system, and the ultimate increase in the number of parties with representation in the national Chamber.

2019	86255	880	Labor market Organization and the Introduction of Proportional Representation	The origins of Proportional Representation (PR) remains one of the great questions in political science. Previous literature has focused on electoral explanations; they highlight how bourgeoisie parties tried to maintained power in the face of the rise of social democratic parties, opting for PR as the second best solution. We argue that the electoral approach must be accompanied with a labor market approach to give a complete picture. Using roll call data from six reform proposals in 1919 Norway, we find that bourgeoisie candidates that were exposed to worker militancy in the form of strikes in their electoral constituency were more likely to vote for the introduction of PR, even when controlling for social democratic vote share in their constituency. Indicators of employer organization are also a significant predictor of conservatives voting for PR.	Magnus Rasmussen, Haakon Gjerløw	NA
2019	87064	1234	Coping and the Political Behavior of Low Socioeconomic Status Individuals	The recent increase in inequality and the prominence of populism make it particularly relevant to understand the political behavior of individuals with relatively low socioeconomic status (SES). I provide a framework to study the political choices of low SES individuals as the outcome of coping with the self-esteem and shame threats emerging from low status. Building on different strands of literature, I identify four stylized strategies to cope with these threats: “Problem-focused”, “meaning-focused”, “withdrawal”, and “aggression” coping. I argue that these coping strategies can result in different political behaviors, namely left redistributive vote, non-class based vote, vote abstention and far-right vote, respectively, and review evidence from political science and social psychology supporting this connection. The framework can integrate several existing theories explaining political choices of low SES individuals and provide new insights on the study of populism and political abstention. I consider factors that lead individuals of similar SES to adopt these different coping styles. I bring the framework to bear on data from original surveys in very diverse contexts: South Africa, Tunisia, and Ireland.	Miquel Pellicer	NA
2019	85846	612	The Size of the Public Sector and Well Being: A Global Appaisal	This paper builds on previous research assessing the impact of the size of the public sector on subjective well-being (happiness/life satisfaction). While previous empirical studies focused exclusively on OECD countries, new data sets have made possible a global analysis with a much wider set of countries. Using data from the recent Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators data set, we examine the impact of public employment as a share of employment on subjective well-being in 117 countries from 2000-2016. We find that, controlling for appropriate political and economic indicators, an increase in the size of the public sector exerts a positive and significant impact on well-being. We conclude with implications for future research.	Alexander Pacek	NA
2019	86584	1147	Engaged and Enraged? The Role of Political Efficacy in Support for Populism	It has been suggested that the global rise of populism experienced in recent decades can be linked to the gradual growth of objective and subjective indicators of political competence usually referred to as the process of “cognitive mobilization.” Along these lines, this paper tests the rather paradoxical claim that populist attitudes among citizens are enhanced by stronger feelings of internal political efficacy (i.e. the self-perceived ability to understand and to participate in politics). Drawing on a collection of cross-national, longitudinal, and experimental data, we find internal efficacy to be consistently related to support for populism. Furthermore, results indicate that this association may be explained in part by the role of internal efficacy in facilitating the emergence of feelings of anger in the presence of threat. These findings underscore the role of political competence and emotion as a unifying characteristic of support for populism in Western European societies, while also suggesting paths for addressing the consequences of rising populist attitudes.

2019	86412	999	Political Mistrust and Party Choice	While political research has investigated extensively the causes of political mistrust, considerably less empirical efforts have been devoted to examining the role of political mistrust for electoral behavior. This paper focuses on the decline of trust in national parliaments and political parties across over thirty European democracies during the period 2002 to 2016, and on its effects on party choice with the goal of providing a better understanding of the decline of mainstream as well as the rise of populist and radical parties. Using individual-level survey data from eight waves of the European Social Survey we use “pseudo-panels” and matching approaches to estimate dynamic models from repeated-cross sections. We apply the method to investigate how political trust develops and affects party choice. Special emphasis is put into identifying which dissatisfied mainstream voters switch to moderate parties and which switch to populist/radical parties. Our first results indicate that distrust affects the support for mainstream parties and motivates voters to support third-parties. Furthermore, they demonstrate that some third parties benefit more than others from the electoral loses of mainstream parties.	Constanza Sanhueza Petrarca, Heiko Giebler	NA
2019	86289	904	The Limited Ideological Convergence of Single-Winner Elections to the Median Voter: Is Trump an Outlier?	The median voter theorem (MVT) states that two candidates, competing in a single member district (SMD), will converge ideologically to the median voter’s policy preference. Combining MVT with Duverger’s law implies that all SMD elections should eventually converge to the median voter. However, multiple candidates do compete, and research on real-world data has repeatedly shown non-convergence. One of the previously proposed reasons of non-convergence has been this involvement of multiple candidates. I propose that, even when elections eventually feature only two candidates, the campaign process which leads to the emergence of these two candidates will likely result in non-median convergence. This paper uses a simulation approach to demonstrate predictable, non-median convergence, and is illustrated via real world data - the 2016 U.S. Republican presidential primaries – single-winner elections with multiple candidates and a non-median winner.

2019	85873	635	Illuminating a ‘Black Hole’. Radical Right Parties‘ Indirect Effect on Immigration Policies.	My paper examines the oppositional influence of radical right parties (RRP) on immigration policies and thereby represents a first step to illuminate the ‘black hole’ regarding indirect policy effects. Scholarship has heretofore mainly focused on RRP’ impact on party competition and only recently started to address their oppositional effect on legislative behaviour. Drawing on Sulkin’s theory of issue uptake, indirect effects of RRP are understood as interaction of their campaign stance and the subsequent electoral result. My quantitative analysis of up to 33 industrialized countries over 30 years introduces a heretofore largely absent cross-national perspective. Differentiating between economic, social and humanitarian aspects of immigration policy also extends the topical scope of existing scholarship. Preliminary results indicate that agency and electoral threat by RRP are linked to more restrictive immigration policies irrespective of their mere parliamentary presence. My paper shows the necessity to consider indirect effects of radical right parties on immigration policy in more detail. Additionally, it provides first insights into the influence of oppositional parties on legislative behaviour in emerging policy areas such as globalisation and environmentalism.	Valentin Berger	NA
2019	85810	592	Better change your mind? The effect of refugee settlement on politicians' policy stances	How does the exposure to refugees affect politicians' issue stances? This paper uses a novel panel data set of Finnish politicians' responses to voting advice applications to empirically measure how politicians thought about refugee intake before and after they were exposed to refugee arrivals and how much spillover the refugee issue creates to other policy sectors. Moreover, the paper measures how the local political context as well as the candidates' vulnerability and party family possibly account for heterogeneous response to refugee arrivals and how much electoral reward there is for different stances. The data enables us to implement a robust difference-in-differences analysis with respect to one of the burning questions in political science, namely, what drives native's responses to immigration and refugee intake in today's Europe and what the policy-related repercussions are of this increased refugee intake.

2019	86318	926	Zoonotic Parties: How Niche Party Electoral Success Runs through Mainstream Party Contagion	The literature on party contagion suggests that niche parties are particularly capable of influencing mainstream party positions on issues owned by niche parties. At the same time, research suggests this is a losing strategy: when mainstream political parties shift towards niche party positions, their vote totals shrink and niche parties gain votes. These two strands of research suggest that niche parties, acting as issue entrepreneurs, can become more electorally viable. However, the ability of niche parties to grow electoral strength may be dependent on the ability to niche parties to “infect” mainstream parties, and shift their positions. This study examines whether such a vector, from niche party issue entrepreneurship, to mainstream party position shifts, to voters abandoning mainstream parties for niche parties does, indeed, exist. Focusing on immigration and ecological policy in Europe, we use data from the Comparative Manifestos Project, ParlGov, and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems to test this relationship. This study has important implications for understanding dynamics of parties’ strategies and party competition, as well as the growing strength of niche parties in advanced democratic states.

2019	86548	1115	Public Support for Costly Policy - Results from a Cross-Country Conjoint Experiment on Sustainable Food Policies	Many individuals state that they want to consume sustainably but in everyday life do not live up to this goal. Given this attitude-behavior gap some call upon the state to regulate and incentivize sustainable consumption. Yet, serious public opposition is expected when governments introduce costly policies, especially in case the state intervenes into citizens’ personal consumption choices. To test this widespread assumption, we concentrate on the food sector and employ a stated-choice experiment with an original, representative sample of 4’874 citizens from China, Germany, and the United States to compare public support for packages of different policy types (i.e., market-based, regulatory and information-based instruments) aiming at the reduction of meat and fish products. In contrast to our expectations, we find that citizens across three major economies do not strongly oppose the introduction of costly policies in the food sector. We show that public support depends on specific policy design features such as the policy stringency and revenue earmarking, but not necessarily on the instrument type. We also find cross-country variations and explore how personal values interact with policy support.	Lukas Fesenfeld, Michael Wicki	NA
2019	85848	614	The impact of environmental attitudes on public support for domestic water charges	Previous research provides evidence that environmental attitudes can have tangible effects on support for policies that are environmentally beneficial. However, it is unclear whether such attitudes can affect support for such policies when they are not being primarily framed through an environmental lens in the public sphere. This paper examines this issue using the case of support for the reintroduction of water charges in Ireland using data from the 2011 Irish National Election Study. This was a contentious issue with debate largely focused on the policy's potential economic and social impacts in the context of a struggling national economy, but its important environmental implications were largely sidelined.The results find that while individuals’ willingness to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth at the policy level did not affect their support for water charges, their willingness to make individual sacrifices for the environment did. These findings have a particular importance given the recent struggles that governments are facing in implementing environmental taxes and charges.	John Kenny	NA
2019	83943	252	Do citizens demand firm regulation? Voluntary responsible business measures by multinationals and public opinion on regulatory standards	Can firms preempt government regulation by running voluntary social and environmental programs? We investigate public support for regulatory standards when multinational corporations conduct voluntary social/environmental measures. We propose that from the viewpoint of citizens, the perception of regulation gaps depends on corporate practice. Firms can signal through voluntary measures that they already engage in pro-environmental/pro-social behaviour, making government-imposed rules obsolete. Moreover, we argue that this signal varies with involved sectors, number of firms and by inclusion of external oversight over voluntary measures. We study the question for the case of a popular initiative in Switzerland. In a survey embedded experiment fielded in late 2018, we test whether support for regulation as such and for the popular initiative in particular decreases if voters receive a signal on corporate action. Preliminary results indicate that voluntary measures tend to decrease public support for government regulation. It seems, however, that the type of voluntary measures is more relevant in that relationship than hitherto assumed. Our results shed light on an understudied mechanism by which firms affect government policy.	Dennis Kolcava	NA
2019	83432	225	Who is High-Income, Anyway?: Social Comparison, Subjective Group-Identification, and Preferences over Progressive Taxation	One crucial puzzle in political economy is why most high-income earners support progressive taxation. This empirical pattern holds across countries with vastly different economic and political characteristics and is not well accounted for in exist- ing models of political economy. This article explains why most affluent individuals fail to recognize that they belong to the high-income income group and how this misperception affect their preferences over progressive tax rates. To explain this mechanism theoretically, I propose a model of generating perceptions about income distribution through self-comparison to an endogenous reference group. These perceptions, in turn, affect preferences over progressive taxation. Relying on ISSP data and an original survey experiment, I find strong evidence for the model’s empirical implications: most high-income earners support progressive taxation when they identify with the lower income groups. Additionally, individuals who overestimate the annual income of the high-income group are more likely to support progressive taxation.	Asli Cansunar	NA
2019	85992	694	Public Support for Different Types of Costly Climate Policies: Insights from a Cross-Country Conjoint Experiment on Transportation Policies	Public support is typically a precondition for the successful implementation of costly climate policies affecting a large majority of citizens. Focusing on the case of transportation, we test public support for different policy-designs including different market-based as well as command-and-control push and pull instruments. Previous literature suggests that push measures are less supported compared to pull measures. Additionally, it is argued that market-based instruments receive lowest support, because costs are more visible compared to other measures. We also test how support depends on the earmarking of tax revenues and individual car dependency. In our empirical analysis we employ a stated-choice experiment with an original, representative sample of 4’876 citizens conducted in early 2018 in China, Germany, and the United States. In contrast to the theoretical expectations, we find that public support does not necessarily depend on the instrument type but rather on specific policy design features such as policy stringency and revenue earmarking. Individual car dependency significantly influences public support. Overall, our results show interesting variations of policy design effects on public support among the three country cases.

2019	85788	578	Miami Vice: The Effect of Anti-Corruption Campaigns on Money Laundering	Autocratic governments regularly wage anti-corruption campaigns against members of the elite. By strengthening institutions, imposing transparency rules, and arresting officials, regimes claim they are enforcing discipline within the bureaucracy and responding to popular grievances. However, there is little evidence that these initiatives are anything more than a facade to increase regime legitimacy. Campaigns are accused of targeting political opponents rather than taking on complicit officials. Part of the difficulty in evaluating these reforms is establishing a baseline level of corruption before they are begun. In response, this paper investigates a major anti-corruption campaign in Russia which required high-level officials to disclose foreign properties and the funds used to purchase them. First, I match sales records from Florida counties to census data on where Russian-language speakers reside. Using a difference-in-differences design, I then demonstrate that purchases of expensive real estate, in particular those that used anonymous LLCs as the transaction party, dropped in Russian-speaking areas after the passage of the law. These results suggest that domestic anti-corruption campaigns can compel elite loyalty to the regime by reducing their international exit options.	David Szakonyi	NA
2019	85835	605	Controlled Confusion: Manipulation of Public Attribution of Responsibility in Autocracies	This study examines whether and how contents of media reporting impact citizens' perception of public policy outcomes, responsibility for those outcomes and evaluation of the politicians in non-democratic context in the city of Novosibirsk, Russia. I analyze data from a panel survey experiment in which respondents in are asked to watch video news reports on (a) Outcomes of the medical and educational policy, and/or (b) Information on responsibility allocation for these policies between municipal and regional government. Respondents are then asked to evaluate the outcomes of various economic policies as well as performance of different levels of government. The design me to learn whether popularity of the government in countries without strong democratic traditions and vibrant media is predicated on potentially strategic framing by the media. One unique feature of this study is its focuse not just on performance, but also on responsibility allocation between multiple tiers of the government. This feature allows me to test ability of citizens to correctly attribute responsibility in multi-level government structures -- important but empirically understudied aspect of political accountability in comparative context.

2019	85978	690	Why So Insecure? The Benefits to Autocrats from Popular Approval	Why do authoritarian regimes desire approval from their populations? Existing theories of when and why authoritarian regimes desire an approving populace are concerned with threats of revolution and unrest (Acemoglu and Robinson 2005) or ultimately focus on specific subsets of the mass public (Svolik 2012). But beyond foreclosing existential threats from revolution, an approving public offers many potential benefits to autocrats over a discontented public. In this paper, I develop a broad theory of why and when non-democracies may seek the approval of the mass public. I differentiate between approval for various actors within authoritarian regimes as well as economic and political sources of approval. I test the currency of potential benefits using a newly-assembled monthly dataset of Russian public opinion consisting of nearly 1 million responses, novel search engine data, and observational data. I identify plausibly causal effects by leveraging sudden shocks to regime support and regional economic performance measures. The findings in this paper have implications for how we understand autocratic stability and rule, the role of public opinion in authoritarian regimes, and authoritarian accountability.

2019	86009	699	Presidents, parliaments, and incentives for public investments during elections	Theories of autocratic co-option rest on at least two central, but contested assumptions: That legislators are sufficiently empowered to demand concessions from the president, and that even unfree elections are competitive enough to discipline political elites. In the case of public investments in non-democratic countries and developing democracies, I find support for both of these crucial assumptions. Using data on georeferenced investment projects across Africa, I find that these investments are more in line with the president's preferences prior to presidential elections, but more in line with legislators' preferences close to legislative elections. Taken together, the findings strongly suggest that legislators in such systems do have the power to demand concessions from president, and that unfree elections can discipline political elites.

2019	83503	227	“This Rally Is Not Sanctioned”: Pre-emptive Repression and Protests in Autocracies	Contemporary autocrats increasingly deny opposition parties and activists the permission to occupy central spaces and stage protests. How does pre-emptive repression – such as prohibitions on assembly – affect dissent in electoral autocracies? Does information that rallies have been unsanctioned undermine, or bolster support for the opposition in these regimes? Leveraging empirical evidence from regional media sources and an original protest-event dataset of more than 10,000 entries, this paper identifies, for the first time, subnational variation in cycles of pre-emptive repression in contemporary Russia. Results demonstrate an inverse relationship between prohibitions of assembly and protest frequency, as well as a positive correlation between unauthorised protests and the use of police violence in these events. Moreover, an original framing experiment, embedded in a face-to-face survey of Russian voters, allows us to provide causal evidence of how information that rallies are unsanctioned influences the propensity to engage in unrest and shapes support for the opposition. Findings add to recent studies on the observational challenges of studying repression in autocracies and have implications for the literatures on protests and authoritarian resilience.

2019	84383	297	Do protests matter? Examining the impact of anti-Iraq War protests on congressional voting	Empirical evidence is mixed whether social movements can exert a political impact. For instance, despite repeated and large-scale anti-Iraq War demonstrations since 2003, protesters in the US neither prevented the war nor achieved an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. To examine the impact of protests, recent research highlights that a better understanding of protest dynamics can be obtained when using disaggregated data. By linking state-level protest events to individual roll call votes in the House of Representatives, I analyze whether members of Congress are responsive to protests in their home state. The analysis uses new data on anti-Iraq War protests and individual voting behavior on the withdrawal or redeployment of troops from Iraq between 2003 and 2008. Results show that a representative is more likely to vote for a redeployment of troops and an end of war in Iraq when an antiwar protest occurred in his or her home state. The substantial effect, however, is smaller than the role of party affiliation. This suggests that protest on military matters and international conflict may only be of limited political impact.

2019	86020	703	Creating Critical Citizens? The Causal Effect of Protests on Public Opinion	What is the effect of protests on public opinion? While contentious actions are an essential form of claims-making, we still have limited knowledge of their short-term consequences on the attitudes of the population at large. This paper fills this gap by elaborating a theory of the effect of protests on public opinion. I argue that protests can help create the kind of informed, critical citizens that many authors have considered important for the quality of democracy. That is because protests voice non-institutionalized actors instead of elites in the public debate, making that debate more relatable. I test this claim with resource to a quasi-experimental design that takes advantage of a large protest that happened during the fieldwork of the ESS5 in Portugal. Supporting the argument, exposure to the protest increased dissatisfaction with elite performance and time spent reading about politics in newspapers. I test the mechanism using a difference-in-differences design, which shows that the protest caused an increase in the number of claims by non-institutionalized actors reported in the press.

2019	86044	721	Does social mobilisation matter? The impact of civic engagement with monitoring the 2015 presidential elections in Poland	In recent years we have observed an increased engagement of citizen’s movements with elections in democratic polities. Yet our understanding of the influence that this engagement can have over elections is still rather limited. In this paper we study electoral consequences of citizens’ involvement in monitoring 2015 presidential elections in Poland. Our analysis provides strong support for arguments saying that watchdog organisations may have an important influence on electoral outcomes. Our findings suggest that in municipalities in which election observers were present the share of vote for an incumbent candidate, Bronisław Komorowski, was significantly lower than in municipalities where the watchdog organisation did not have its representatives. Our results are robust to several tests which allows us to argue that the effect we find should not be attributed to some unobservable factors.	Przemysław Kurek	NA
2019	82571	173	In and Out Bürger: A field experiment testing behavioural interventions to increase engagement of bureaucrats with information from and about citizens	There is nothing more fundamental to democracy than ensuring that citizens have a say in what type of institutions and services governments produce. Elections are only part of this. However, in the years between elections, citizen's power to influence policy design and implementation is limited. Forms of participatory democracy have been promoted as a solution to this problem. Yet, evidence on whether they are effective is scant (Mutz, 2007), and that which is available, suggests that little feeds into policy design and implementation (Voorberg, Bekkers & Tummers 2015). This study employs a large field experiment (N=7,532) to test (1) whether citizen input filters through to bureaucrats tasked with policy design and implementation. Given that a lack of motivation to engage with citizen input poses a serious obstacle to the functioning of inter-election democracy, the field experiment further tests (2) whether bureaucrats' engagement with citizen input can be increased by using non-monetary rewards and value-based communication (e.g. Gallus 2017; Kosfeld & Neckermann 2011). I find a low level of baseline engagement (~30%) but that motivational interventions increase engagement with citizen input to ~60%.	Annabelle Wittels	NA
2019	84663	342	How Familiarity Improves Judicial Deliberation: Evidence from the German Federal Court	How does group familiarity affect judging on a multi-member court? Deliberation among judges has a central role in the judicial decision making process as emphasized by scholars and judges alike. The quality of such deliberation is therefore essential to successful adjudication. In this paper I argue that collegial deliberation works better when judges are more familiar with each other. Relying on a novel data set of appeals in criminal cases at the German Federal Court of Justice I show that familiarity substantially increases the probability that judges disagree after first stage deliberations and schedule a main hearing. On the other hand, judges new to the court and judges serving outside their usual panel conform more often to the opinion of other judges which decreases the likelihood of a main hearing. Finally, I find some evidence that familiar panels tend to write longer justifications while those by panels with outsider judges tend to be shorter. I conclude that the quality of adjudication can be improved by promoting familiarity between as many judges as possible.	Tilko Swalve	NA
2019	86415	1002	Political Bias in Judicial Pre-Trial Decisions on Domestic Violence: A Natural Experiment	The aim of this paper is to provide an explanation of the variation in lower-court judicial decisions over restraining orders to protect victims of domestic violence, under a civil-law system. Despite the typical anonymity of lower-court judges in such legal systems, we are able to exploit a natural experiment in Spain that allows us to estimate the effect of judges’ policy preferences, gender, and career incentives on decisions regarding the protection of victims of domestic violence. To do so, we combine the attitudinal and strategic models of judicial behavior, arguing that the effect of policy preferences on such decisions is moderated by gender. We find, first, that the probability to grant a restraining order is significantly higher among female judges than male judges. Secondly, that policy preferences affect only male judges. These findings are a relevant contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms behind judicial decision bias under civil-law systems, where judges’ policy preferences tend to be unobservable by institutional design.

2019	85911	656	Limits to Bureaucratic Oversight? Evidence from a Laboratory- and Survey-Experiment	This study tests the effect of Public Service Motivation (PSM) and job-related risk aversion on subjects' behavior in the Oversight Game (OG), a game-theoretical vehicle that captures the essence of the bureaucratic agency problem. Evidence from two experimental studies, namely a laboratory- and a survey-experiment, conducted with an identical parametrization of the OG, can be summarized in two points: First, the rational solution, a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, as well as the minimax decision rule fail to predict subjects' behavior. Second, individual characteristics matter, as higher levels of risk aversion make inspection more and shirking less likely, while PSM has only a limited effect on subjects’ behavior in the OG. These findings hint towards the conceptual limits of PSM and highlight the importance of understanding risk preference in order to devise effective oversight systems.	Markus Tepe	NA
2019	86568	1132	Patterns of authority over space and time	Why are some political systems riven by political instability and regime failure while other polities stably endure for decades? We posit that the basis for political stability stems from institutional configurations that are significantly more congruent than others and instability results from incongruent institutions. The historic Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset (dating back to 1790) is used to propose a novel polity type characterization along electoral, liberal and participatory dimensions. The three dimensions span a cube covering all regime types. An 'axis of democracy' connects the perfect democracy and perfect autocracy corners of the cube. The further away a certain regime type is from the axis, the less likely it is to ever exist or - if it does, the more likely it is to fail quickly.In a second step, regime survival times are analyzed and tested using both a Cox regression as well as parametric functional forms. Preliminary results suggest that non-congruent sets of institutions are less stable, i.e. the long-lasting and more consistent regimes are those located around the perfect democracy and autocracy corners of the cube.

2019	76323	40	The Paradox of Repression : The Effects and Consequences of Repression on Dissent in Authoritarian Settings	Why does repression sometimes work to deter dissent while in other cases repression leads to more collective action and escalation in authoritarian regimes? I argue that the effect of repression on dissent depends largely on whether systemic opposition parties join forces with non-systemic opposition forces that facilitates continued mobilization and can subsequently withstand violent repression. Under authoritarian rule, in exchange for crucial electoral support, systemic opposition parties have electoral incentives to seek out and develop societal-electoral alliances with independent non-systemic opposition groups that tend to have extensive associational and social networks that are conducive for collective action. In return, systemic opposition parties can provide significant financial, logistic, and institutional resources that are otherwise limited in authoritarian settings. Without such societal-electoral strategic coalition, the costs of continued mobilization in the face of increased repression are often too great to bear. In authoritarian regimes where such societal-electoral coalition exists, violent repression, rather than effectively suppresses dissent, can lead to further mobilization and escalate into a larger conflict.

2019	84433	311	The Politics of Data Production Dissemination in Non-Democracies	Data availability has long been a challenge for scholars of authoritarian politics. However, the promotion of open government data, through initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and as conditionalities tied to foreign aid, has motivated many of the world's more closed regimes to produce and publish fine-grained data on public goods, taxation, etc. While this has been a boon to scholars of non-democracies, we argue that the politics of data production and dissemination create new challenges including threats to inference and ethical concerns. Systematically missing or biased data and selective restrictions on data collection may jeopardize research quality and lead scholars to parrot the `party line' in data form. To demonstrate this, we compare data from Tanzania's Open Data Portal with verified internal figures. Furthermore, the high stakes of data transparency lead to new risks for researchers, local data collectors and research subjects. Such risks can further the extractive nature of research in non-Western settings. We conclude with recommendations on how scholars can educate themselves about the politics of data, acknowledge potential bias, and leverage other methods where possible.	Rachael McLellan	NA
2019	85815	596	Geographical Coverage in Comparative Politics Research	We describe and analyze pattern in the geographical focus and coverage of comparative politics research across more than a century. Robust inferences about how political processes, institutions and systems work rely on the ability to draw information from a wide variety of contexts. Yet, using a new database covering eight major journals publishing comparative politics research, we detail how comparative politics research historically drew most of its information from a few countries, mainly located in North America and Western Europe. We detail how this picture has changed over recent decades, with comparative politics becoming increasingly ``globalized', although comparativists have turned their focus towards different countries and regions at different time periods. Still, even today several countries have hardly been researched at all. We analyze several correlates of a country being the focus of comparative politics research, studying factors such as population size, income level, economic growth, language, presence of conflict, democratization episodes, and political system features. Our analysis reveals clear and systematic variation in terms of which countries receive attention and which ones do not by researchers in the field.	Carl Henrik Knutsen	NA
2019	86387	981	The Rise of Majority-Ethnic Nationalism and Cooperation among Marginalized Minorities	The rise of majority-ethnic nationalism - a trend witnessed across the globe - threatens the material and symbolic status of ethnic minorities who do not share the ethnic traits associated with national identity. A common group threat is generally thought to unite threatened groups under a common banner, strengthening identification and enhancing cooperation. However, ethnic minorities do not always respond to group threats in concert. On the contrary, a threatening environment sometimes results in fragmentation and intra-group competition. Through cooperation games among Muslims in Pune, India, this study aims to shed light on the diverging effects of Hindu nationalist threat on intra-group cooperation among Muslims. By randomly assigning a prime that devalues the Muslim identity according to the Hindu nationalist narrative, as well as status divisions within groups of Muslim participants, the study highlights the moderating effect of cross-cutting status divisions on cooperation among marginalised groups.

2019	86497	1069	Colonial Cash Crops and Political Power in Sub-Saharan Africa	The unequal representation of ethnic groups in African governments is often seen as key driver of political instability, economic inequality, and comparatively low levels of development. This paper investigates the economic foundations of ethnic ruling coalitions. We study how natural resource endowments have historically affected ethnic groups’ representation in national governments. Cash crop producing groups are better represented due to two main mechanisms. On the one hand, cash cropping groups had an early advantage in terms of elite formation and collective mobilization. On the other, they are more attractive coalition partners for incumbents who want to tax areas of diffuse agricultural export production. We combine information on the ethnic homelands of African cabinet ministers with new data on the geospatial location of major export commodities in the late colonial age. Our results show that cash crop groups are overrepresented in African post-independence ruling coalitions while mining or food-producing locations are not. We estimate causal effects by instrumenting colonial cash crops with agro-climatic suitability scores and exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in global commodity prices to predict within-group changes in representation levels.

2019	85678	533	The Legacies of Colonial Partition on Ethnic Politics in Contemporary Africa	One common explanation for ethnicized politics and limited national identification in Africa lies with colonial boundaries. Europeans frequently divided ethnic groups as they divvied territory in the nineteenth century; this might have long-run repercussions, as individuals prioritize ties with coethnics in neighboring states rather than with non-coethnic co-nationals. We test these arguments using georeferenced data from rounds 3-6 of the Afrobarometer. Our results suggest that membership in a divided group is actually associated with greater identification with the nation-state. These results are robust to different measures of the extent to which an ethnic group was split, use of different conceptualizations of what constitutes ethnic groups, and various considerations of ethnic groups' local and national demographic and political power. We consider several possible explanations for these findings, including whether colonizers explicitly avoided dividing groups with particularly strong pre-colonial identities, and whether division had detrimental effects on groups' institutions and identities, thereby weakening them vis-à-vis non-divided groups.

2019	85683	537	The Precolonial Origins of Within-Ethnic Group Inequality	Ethnic inequality comprises both the average difference in income/wealth between groups (between group inequality or BGI) and the difference in income/wealth among members of different groups (within group inequality or WGI). The interactive effect of BGI and WGI is known to affect a range of political outcomes from voting to conflict. BGI and WGI appear to be highly durable over time. Although the origins of BGI have been investigated by other authors, little attention has been paid to the long-run sources of variation in WGI. We theorize that, in sub-Saharan Africa, WGI is primarily determined by the type of political institutions in place prior to colonization. In particular, ethnic groups with highly centralized pre-colonial institutions tend to have lower levels of within-group inequality today. Using a dataset on more than 400 ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa, we show that pre-colonial institutions have a significant effect on WGI. We also demonstrate that the effect of pre-colonial institutions is stronger that that of geographic endowments and colonial institutions.	Christian Houle	NA
2019	86573	1137	Political Attitudes toward Affirmative Action Quotas in Public Sector Employment in Brazil	Few public policies have been as contentious as affirmative action. Theoretical explanations for why the public support or oppose affirmative action have centered on left-right ideological divides on the role of government; the competition for scarce resources and the perception of threat; and racial prejudice. Most studies have focused on the U.S. context, but Brazil has recently introduced wide-ranging affirmative action policies affecting both admission to federal universities and public sector employment. To date, a body of research has focused on the effects of these new quotas on higher education---but, to our knowledge---no studies have explored the public perceptions toward affirmative action quotas in the federal bureaucracy. We turn to a unique survey asked of a random sample of the Brazilian population, and conducted in partnership with the federal government, that employs a set of survey experiments to evaluate attitudes toward affirmative action. Our analysis sheds new light on debates in the literature on the determinants of political attitudes surrounding these contentious polices, and also speaks more generally to the public debate about affirmative action in Brazil and beyond.

2019	86961	1226	Citizen Evaluations of Patrons and Clients in Different Forms of Clientelism	After focusing on vote-buying and the “supply side” for the last two decades, new literature on clientelism emphasizes the important role of clients in the exchange, the citizen perspective on clientelism, as well as the diversity of clientelistic exchanges. These new strands of research highlight that the citizen perspective on clientelism matters for the persistence of clientelism in that they might be supportive of clientelism or reject it. We use a conjoint experiment that is currently (December 2018/ January 2019) implemented with respondents of disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Tunis and Cape town to study how poor citizens evaluate different types of clientelistic exchanges including vote-buying, relational clientelism, and collective clientelism. We have two key interests: First, we seek to understand the role of the value of the exchanged goods, their scarcity, the asymmetry of the relationship between patron and client, and the size of the beneficiary group in driving the evaluation. Second, we evaluate whether citizens differentiate between the patron’s and the client’s behaviour when attributing blame and whether this varies across types of clientelism.	Eva Wegner	NA
2019	87062	1233	The price of respect: The value of material vs. non-material benefits in clientelistic exchanges	Most standard literature in political science focuses on the material benefits that clientelism provides. However, literature with an ethnographic focus emphasizes the non-material aspects of the exchange, such as rituals and 'meanings'. One non-material aspect of clientelism that is starting to receive attention is dignity and respect. We build on social psychology theories to theorize the role of dignity in clientelistic exchanges. We focus on the potential for clientelistic relations to embody more or less belonging and status. We study the importance of these two dimensions for how clients evaluate clientelistic exchanges. We use a vignette experiment embedded in a survey in South Africa and Tunisia. Respondents are confronted with a one out of four vignettes describing a vote-buying attempt. The four vignettes vary in whether the exchange emphasizes the low status of the client or not, and on whether they display high or low warmth from the part of the patron/broker. We estimate how much money clients require or are willing to give up in order to accept offers placing them in different status and warmth/belonging situations.	Miquel Pellicer	NA
2019	77725	64	How Electoral Cycles Shape the Implementation of Public Programs:Evidence from India	This study sheds new light on the welfare implications of electoral cycles by examining how election timing shapes the implementation of public works programs. Using data from a program in India that provides a fixed allotment to MPs to undertake public works projects in their constituencies, the analyses show that pre-election periods exhibited a significant increase - relative to other periods - in the proportion of funds allocated to projects that ultimately did not get completed. Further analyses cast doubt on the possibility that the results are driven by strained bureaucratic capacity, increased corruption or delays resulting from the manipulations of opposition parties. Instead, the results appear to be driven by incumbent turnover produced by the election as well as by the propensity of incumbents to propose a greater proportion of unqualified projects in pre-election periods. These results shed light on important mechanisms through which democratic elections undermine public service delivery.	Anjali Thomas Bohlken	NA
2019	84425	309	Internet Use and Mobilization in Regime Transitions: Competing Risks and Repeated Events in Duration Models	The extensive use of social media by anti-government protesters as well as supporters of authoritarian regimes has bolstered a debate over the influence of internet use on democratization. On the one hand, it has been proposed that internet use increases information, which in return contributes to social capital and facilitates liberalization. On the other hand, additional work suggests that internet use either escalates the conflict or contributes to the resilience of authoritarian regimes. This paper aims to reconcile these empirical findings by using a novel methodological approach that combines the logic of competing risks, repeated events to explore the interaction of internet use and political mobilization on the likelihood of recent political transitions to and from democracy. Based on the Freedom House Index, we categorize regime transitions for 85 countries between 2000 and 2015. Our estimation results reveal that in liberalizing transitions, internet use and mobilization together increase the likelihood of transition. In backsliding transitions, internet use and mobilization reduce the likelihood of autocratic reversal. This study not only resolves an existing debate but also introduces a novel methodological approach.	Berna Öney	NA
2019	84993	394	Surveillance Policies and Citizens’ Political Trust	Surveillance policies are largely intended as preventive measures designed to deter terrorist attacks and crime more generally. At the same time, mass surveillance may interfere with civil liberties and potentially undermines citizens’ political trust. This study examines how mass surveillance affects citizens’ political trust. Specifically, we argue that the way in which surveillance policies are linked to political trust is contingent upon the range and scope of the policy measure (dragnet versus targeted), the salience of security-related threats (esp. terrorist attacks), individual preferences for security, and the risk of authorities violating data protection. Using country and time fixed effects models on repeated cross-sectional European Social Survey waves merged with time-series information on (changes) in surveillance laws (2002-2008), we find that the implementation of untargeted surveillance policies relates to decreasing political trust, on average. However, an extension of targeted surveillance is associated with increasing political trust, but only for individuals who emphasize security values. The hypothesized (conditional) relationships will be further specified and empirically tested using a pre-registered vignette survey experiment to be carried out in February 2019.	Conrad Ziller	NA
2019	86517	1086	Communication Technology and National Identity: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa	An important part of state-building is the creation of a national identity. A long line of theoretical literature leads us to expect that technological advancements facilitate the adoption of a national identity. We investigate the effect of one dimension of technological progress: the expansion of mobile phone coverage across sub-Saharan Africa, which is believed to induce broad changes in political and social life. We use a novel combination of geocoded public opinion data and fine-grained data on mobile phone coverage boundaries. Applying a geographic regression discontinuity design, we show that access to mobile technology decreases the likelihood that an individual identifies with the nation by around 5-7 percentage points. We hypothesize that the decrease in national identification is a result of the ethnically-polarized nature of political rhetoric that is often shared via cell phone networks, especially in the run-up to elections. To establish support for this mechanism, we exploit as-if random variation in the timing of individuals' survey interviews to presidential elections. Our analysis suggests that the proximity to elections intensifies the effect of mobile coverage.	Benjamin Laughlin	NA
2019	86769	1209	Ownership of internet service providers and state control in Africa, 2000-2016	The internet provides a space for sharing digital information and communication. This space is built on a physical infrastructure owned by a variety of public and private actors, foreign and domestic, that reflect a multitude of interests. Internet services are thus no resource that governments or any other political actor have necessarily and automatically at their free disposal. This paper presents a new dataset on telecommunications ownership and state control that allows for comparative large-N analysis of the determinants and effects of varying ownership structures of internet service providers (ISP) in the transforming context of African countries, 2000 to 2016. ISP control the gateway through which data flows in and out and can be seen as “gatekeepers” of the internet. They are thus key actors when it comes to providing and also interrupting access to internet services. Next to a detailed discussion of the conceptualization and operationalization of ownership, we demonstrate both the validity and usefulness of this company-level data. The results show that our dataset provides crucial new information to any study of the internet in political sciences.	Tina Freyburg, Véronique Wavre	NA
2019	85464	492	The Long-term Effects of Demographic Shocks on the Female Political Participation: Evidence from the Transatlantic Slave Trade	Can demographic shocks affect the long-run evolution of female political participation? The paper traces current variations in women’s political attitudes and participation within sub-Saharan Africa to the emergence of a female-biased sex ratio during the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade. This historic shock forced women to substitute for the missing men in communities affected, changing women’s role in society and politics lasting up until today. Exploiting variation in the degree to which different ethnic groups were affected by the transatlantic slave trade, I show the women whose ancestors were more exposed to this shock are today more likely to be in the labor force, more politically self-conscious, and politically active. This effect is not present in communities affected by the Indian slave trade, which had a gender-neutral impact. Local cultural transmission of internal norms across generations of women (but not men) in affected ethnicities seems to be the main mechanism explaining this long-run persistence.	Patrick Kuhn	NA
2019	86283	901	Are women corruption cleansers or part of the problem? Evidence from Afrobarometer rounds 5 and 6	Women and girls suffer disproportionately from the negative consequences of grand corruption (Hossein et al. 2010). Building on the academic debate whether women differ from men when it comes to engaging in grand and petty corruption, I propose that women care about different policy areas in society than men and therefore participate differently in corruption. Focusing my argument and empirical investigation on the bribe-payer side of petty corruption, I specifically look at three policy areas where men and women can potentially bribe government officials: general government services, school services or the health sector. Using individual level survey data for 34 to 36 countries from the African continent (Afrobarometer Round 5 and 6), the empirical evidence suggests that, on average, women are less frequently involved in petty corruption than men when it comes to general government services but equally corrupt for bribery in the health and education sector. Overall, my empirics support that women are not always corruption cleansers but sometimes also equally engaging in corruption as men.	Natascha Neudorfer	NA
2019	87745	1251	Do gender quotas improve political participation? Evidence from a natural experiment in Delhi	I examine whether gender quotas have improved political participation and reduced the gender gap in politics for women in the context of Delhi. I disaggregate and measure political participation in general and context specific ways. I exploit the natural experiment of random quota assignment, where in 50% wards were randomly reserved for women in 2012 and 2017. I embed a two wave panel survey of 1500+ HHs across 18 wards in Delhi within this natural experiment to examine the difference in levels of participation and gender gap between reserved and non-reserved wards. Apart from women's participation and gender gap outcomes, I examine whether quotas were able to mobilise both men and women in the context of anti-corruption protests, anti-rape/ sexual violence and environmental protests that have gripped Delhi since 2012 till date. Lastly, I embed a survey experiment to examine whether being informed about the quota policy as well as gender and quality of the councillor has any effect on perceptions of inclusion and democratic accountability in the political system. I present new results from this original survey.	Tanushree Goyal	NA
2019	85289	439	Mobilizing Women Voters: Experimental Evidence from Pakistan	Reducing the gender gap in politics remains a challenge in much of the developing world. We test one of the reasons behind the low turnout rates for women: a lack of information about public service delivery performance of politicians that is aligned with preferences of women. Before the 2018 elections in Pakistan, we randomized electoral areas and ran a political campaign at the household level to inform women voters about the public service delivery performance of the incumbent politician. Our results suggest that women's turnout in the election increased substantially as did the vote share of the incumbent. In a highly competitive environment, where the winning margin is 0.08% of the total polled votes, we find an increase of 13.3% in female turnout and an increase of 5.6% in the vote share of the incumbent politician. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that this response interacts with social norms in the area: women in areas where polling stations are of mixed gender respond strongly to the treatment, whereas women in areas where polling stations are gendered do not.

2019	86471	1047	How Election Type Shapes the Geography of Electoral Violence: Evidence from Zimbabwe	How does election type affect the geography of election violence? Past research has explored how the competitiveness of elections and electoral rules affect the risk of electoral violence, but has neglected that patterns of violence might be quite different in parliamentary versus presidential elections. We argue that the dynamics of subnational electoral competition, and hence incentives for violence, differ in parliamentary versus presidential elections. In parliamentary elections, party elites focus on winning the majority of districts, and therefore center all campaign efforts, including violence on swing and competitive districts. In presidential elections, the country is usually treated as a single electoral district, and elections are decided by winning a majority of votes across districts. Consequently, we expect parties to use violence to deter turnout in the rival party's strongholds. We test the implications of this argument with georeferenced election violence data from ECAV and district-level election data for presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2008. Our findings allow us to define potential hotspots of violence and have important implications for the study of subnational patterns of violence.	Mascha Rauschenbach	NA
2019	84954	388	How Violence Hardens the Vote: Exposure to Election Violence and Political Attitudes	There is a growing research agenda on how exposure to political violence such as terrorism and wartime violence affects political attitudes and voting behavior. However, we do not know whether and how election violence - a subtype of political violence intended to influence the outcome of elections or express actors’ opposition to electoral processes - affects voters’ political attitudes, including their ideological positioning, trust in government institutions, and perceptions of the democratic process. This paper uses new geocoded data on the incidence of electoral violence and combines it with georeferenced information on individual-level attitudes from Afrobarometer surveys. To estimate the effect of exposure to election violence, we use a difference-in-difference strategy, comparing the effect of election violence in treated units to those that did not experience violence. We also explore temporal variation in exposure to violence, comparing attitudes of those surveyed just before violence happened to those interviewed after.	Inken von Borzyskowski	NA
2019	85297	441	Not All Elections Are Created Equal: Electoral Quality and Civil Conflict	The conflict generating aspects of elections have been long debated by scholars and policymakers alike. Yet, we have surprisingly little understanding about how the quality of these contests influences perceptions of key actors and their incentives for engaging in large-scale violence that escalates to civil war. We argue that electoral integrity moderates the relationship between elections and civil conflict. When the incumbent engages in manipulation or when institutions of election management face problems of bias and incapacity, elections are associated with an increased risk of civil war. This is so, we argue, because low-integrity elections (1) foster grievances that militarized opposition can use to mobilize support and (2) decrease the incumbent’s ability to make credible policy concessions to opposition groups. We assess our hypothesis in a comprehensive sample of developing countries, from 1950 to2012, and find strong support for our expectations. Focusing on executive elections, we find that elections are not associated with civil conflict, on average, but that flawed elections significantly increase the risk of conflict.

2019	86125	785	The Causes and Consequences of Manipulation of Party Primaries	When election winners on the district level are known before elections take place, party primaries become a central procedure for selecting officeholders. Primaries thus matter greatly to democracy. At first glance, primaries may appear to be a sign of party institutionalization and to enhance intra-party democracy in emerging democracies. Nevertheless, studying the case of Malawi we show that both local and national elites frequently manipulate primaries, particularly in party strongholds. Such manipulation distorts the conflict mitigating function of primaries and increases the risk of local elite defection. To test our argument, we introduce data from a systematic observation of the primaries of the three major Malawian parties in the 2019 election in 100 randomly selected constituencies (the Malawi Observation of Party Primaries [MOPP] project). In spite of the importance of primary elections, there is almost no systematic data available on party primaries in the many new democracies and electoral autocracies of Sub-Saharan Africa. Our study seeks to mitigate this shortcoming and the findings have important implications for our understanding of political competition in emerging democracies.

2019	84679	346	Judicial Positions on Political Reform: Designing common policy scores from judicial text	What are the positions of highest courts towards political reform? In order to answer this question scholarship on the US Supreme Court uses judicial votes but those are often not available in cross-country comparison. We present an approach scaling judicial decisions based on features commonly reported in decisions other than votes. Methodologically, we follow established scholarship to identify the polarity of citations in judicial decisions to locate opinions in a doctrine space first. Second, to map opinion locations onto a policy space we apply semantic analyses to identify the polarity of briefs field by political actors. Third, we use the known positions of political actors to meaningful anchor the opinion locations in relation to the political positions on one common space. The procedure applies independent of specific judicial systems but to outline the feasibility, we assess 2211 senate decisions by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Our computed spatial measures allow for assessing the judiciaries’ willingness to support or hinder political reform. Moreover, the measures permit for behavioral research, which has major implications for our understanding of courts as (political) actors.	Benjamin G. Engst	NA
2019	86195	839	Representative Democracy, Countermajoritarian Rulings and Attitudes toward Constitutional Courts - Experimental evidence on the effects of Court rulings in France	We implement a survey experiment to study how rulings by the French Constitutional Council affect citizens' assessments of the Constitutional Council itself but also of the President of the Republic. We find that the satisfaction with and the trust in the Constitutional Council increase when the Council’s decision leads to a preferred policy outcome. However, citizens seem to have procedural preferences beyond policy outcomes: Controlling for policy preferences over outcomes, the Council is evaluated less positively when it uses its veto powers. This effect is stronger when the Council invalidates a law that was an electoral pledge and weaker when citizens are informed that the majority of the members of the Council are politically close to the government. Moreover, a constitutional veto has a negative impact on the assessment of the President. This negative impact is stronger amongst voters who agree with the President's policies and magnified when the Council vetoes an electoral pledge.	Patrick Le Bihan	NA
2019	86207	847	Policy vs. Personal Risk: A New Model and Causal Analysis of the Insurance Theory of Judicial Independence	Why political actors in democracies countenance independent courts able to check their policies remains the central puzzle of comparative judicial politics. Popular “insurance” explanations center on competitive elections: when competition is high, expectations of losing office induce those in power to establish or maintain judicial independence. Despite being predicated on an expected utility calculation, existing research focuses only on variation in the likelihood of losing office, treating the risks of such occurring as constant. This inattention to the actual causal logics of insurance models limits both theoretical development and empirical conclusions. To rectify these two problems, I formalize the expected utility of insurance, integrating both the probability of losing office and its downside risk. I test implications of this model by integrating data on punishment of leaders after leaving office with measures of competition. Furthermore, I develop a plausible instrument for the demand for insurance, thereby offering the first attempt at identification of the causal effect. As such, I advance both our theoretical and empirical understanding of the leading explanatory framework for variation in judicial independence across democracies.	Brad Epperly	NA
2019	77540	58	Do Voters Punish Noncompliance with High Court Rulings? A Cross-National Analysis	Understanding how high courts successfully obtain compliance with decisions invalidating government policies poses a puzzle central to the study of constitutional review. An increasingly popular answer to this puzzle is that voters, by virtue of supporting the rule of law and the legitimacy of the judiciary, punish elected officials at the ballot box for failing to faithfully implement judicial decisions. In this paper, I conduct a cross-national analysis of the relationship between noncompliance and an incumbent government's electoral success. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy project on noncompliance with the national high courts of 70 countries from 2007 to 2017, I examine whether voters systematically punish noncompliance. In doing so, I develop a series of hypotheses derived from the judicial legitimacy literature and the literature on factors influencing electoral accountability. The analysis reveals that while an incumbent government's vote share decreases as noncompliance increases, this relationship is conditional on the quality of electoral democracy in a country, the level of noncompliance at the time of the previous election, and single party/multiparty nature of the government.

2019	86159	810	How to Forecast Constitutional Court Decisions? Legal Context and Political Context in a Machine LearningFramework.	Ex ante forecasting approaches using machine learning become increasingly popular to analyze and predict judicial outcomes. Yet, existing work on the prediction of court decision-making has two important limitations. First, it exclusively focuses on the US Supreme Court. This raises concerns about the external validity of these studies and their implications for courts in different law traditions. Second, none of the existing studies have explicitly tested the relative contribution of legal context versus political context variables to the forecast of court decisions. This study addresses these two points by ex ante predicting over 2,900 decisions of the German Federal Constitutional Court. I find that similar methodological approaches successfully applied to predict Supreme Court decisions also work for Kelsenian European constitutional court types. My results also show that legal context alone is already a good predictor. However, the predictive performance is significantly improved when information about the political context of a decision is added. These findings therefore support the view of a multifaceted decision-making of constitutional courts which is best characterized by the ensemble of both legal and political factors.

2019	86546	1113	Comparability of voters’ left-right placements across countries: an investigation using anchoring vignettes	Using the anchoring vignette technique in our original survey from twelve European countries, we explore whether and to what extent the way citizens make use of the left-right ideological scale is cross-nationally comparable. Making cross-groups comparisons based on survey instruments raises concerns due to the potential risk of incomparability resulting from differential item functioning (DIF). Despite the extensive volume of cross-national studies that rely on voters’ left-right placement of themselves and political parties, its cross-national comparability has been investigated mainly at the level of political parties and experts of politics who assess the parties’ ideological positions. To our knowledge, this paper is first to investigate the DIF issue at the voter level. In doing so, we construct vignettes by varying the descriptions of hypothetical parties on several core left-right features, such as the role of the government and the preferences on spending and tax policies. The results based on the representative sample of twelve Western and Eastern European countries will find out the extent of similarities and differences in the way voters from different political contexts use the left-right scale.

2019	86464	1041	How Stable are 'Left' and 'Right'? Evidence from Two Waves of Open-Ended Survey Questions	Existing evidence on the substantive meaning of the terms 'left' and 'right' usually relies on the analysis of closed survey questions. In this paper, we take a different approach by exploiting the rare case of open-ended survey questions about the meaning of 'left' and 'right' included in candidate surveys of the German national elections of 2013 and 2017. Germany is a particularly interesting case for analysis due to the large change in issue salience between the two elections in the wake of the European refugee crisis. We use Structural Topic Models for extracting different interpretations of both terms and analyze whether their meaning has changed between the elections. We find that the term left was interpreted similarly in both elections, but that the meaning of the term right has changed drastically between 2013 and 2017. This change has been particularly strong among left-wing candidates. We demonstrate that our results have important implications for the context dependency of the interpretation of the left-right scale.	Markus Tepe	NA
2019	86315	923	Equality as the Criterion Separating Left from Right? Eastern and Western Europe 2002-2016	Lipset et al. (1954), Inglehart (1984) and Bobbio (1996) proposed that the left-right dimension as a measurement of ideology is, at its core, a conflict about equality. However, Thorisdottir et al. (2007) found that while left-wing individuals were more egalitarian than right-wing individuals in Western Europe, the same pattern did not hold in Eastern Europe in 2002. This paper examines this puzzle through two approaches. First, the regression models utilised by Thorisdottir et al. (2007) are replicated with data from the European Social Survey 2002, and subsequent years up to 2016. This analysis shows that the pattern has changed over the years in favour of the egalitarian explanation. Second, Inglehart (1984: 293) proposed that equality as a core component of the left-right dimension often manifests itself through group conflicts, whether based on social class, sex/gender or ethnicity. The results of multilevel regressions demonstrate that left-right self-placements can be explained by policy attitudes towards issues that affect the equality of outcome between groups. While weaker in Eastern Europe, more egalitarian attitudes predict left-wing self-placements in both Eastern and Western Europe.	Jesper Lindqvist	NA

This strategy assumes that voter preferences are cross-nationally linked; for example, that electoral results in the Netherlands offer insight into likely outcomes in Germany by revealing voter preferences. However, the extent to which the preferences are correlated, and why they may be correlated, is unknown. We propose a theory that the ideological preferences of citizens across borders are linked as a result of an increasingly integrated global economy. Since market hiccups, threats to labor value, sector shocks, and others, are increasingly shared across borders so too should their political responses. With the use of the most extensive data collection to date on the preferences of voters, we expect to find greater preference congruence among those in countries with similar economic structures and unifying economic institutions. Our findings reveal that cross-border policy diffusion could be the result of leaders responding in similar fashions to shifting demands by similar electorates, rather than a process of strategic emulation in leaders’ strategies.

2019	82212	154	Does Public Support Help Democracy Survive?	Democracy is widely thought to require public support to survive. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is, however, weak with only a handful of tests, all utilizing small cross-sectional samples, and finding contradictory results. The obstacle has been that survey data on democratic support are fragmented across time, space, and survey item. In response, we use a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 26 years. With estimates of opinion now varying over time as well as space, we can use methods of panel data analysis to adjust both for the effects of prior democracy on current support and for unobserved time-invariant confounders such as historical 'critical junctures' which produced both democracy and a supportive political culture. We find that democratic support is positively associated with subsequent democracy. It is, moreover, more robustly linked with the survival of democracy than its emergence in the first place. As Easton hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help democracy survive.	Christopher Claassen	NA
2019	85664	530	Democratization and Representative Bureaucracy---An Analysis of Promotion Patterns in Indonesia's Civil Service, 1980-2015	Civil service organizations in the developing world are often unrepresentative of the populations they serve. A lack of representation for women and minorities has important consequences for the quality of public goods provision and the bureaucracy's perceived legitimacy. We ask what effect does democratization have on representation patterns in the civil service? We argue that democratization can lead to increased discrimination in the civil service due to the increased politicization of identity cleavages in the political arena. While authoritarian leaders use access to civil service positions to ensure their political survival, they are often insulated from majoritarian demands for discrimination and can resist them when politically expedient. We test this argument using administrative data from Indonesia that covers the full universe of career histories of all 4+ million currently active civil servants. We exploit the exogenous timing of Indonesia's democratization in 1999 and the subsequent staggered introduction of local direct elections, paired with an individual-level difference-in-difference design, for identification purposes. We find strong evidence that democratization worsened the career prospects of female and some religious minority civil servants.	Jan Pierskalla	NA
2019	85814	595	Changing patterns and relationships in the study of democratization	Time plays an important role in various theories in political science, which often point to temporal heterogeneity in relationships of interest. We customize and employ recent models of change point detection to address core questions of temporal heterogeneity in the study of democratization. Change point models are inherently inductive in nature. They identify systematic patterns in the data and then researchers can interpret these patterns after the fact. But, one can also combine results from such analysis with clear a priori expectations in theory-testing exercises. We employ change point models to both these ends in two empirical applications. We first re-investigate the proposition by Albertus (2017) that labor-dependent agriculture had a more pronounced negative effect on democratic outcomes before the ``third wave of democratization'. Next, we utilize new data of regimes from the (Historical) Varieties of Democracy dataset to investigate the link between income and democracy. Thus, by drawing on data that span from the French revolution to the present, we use change point models to examine the proposed time-variant (e.g., Boix 2011) nature of the development--democracy relationship.

2019	77175	50	Cannot Go Further without Consensus: Assessing the Effects of Three Modes of Transitions on Democratic Survival	This article answers why regime survival varies across nascent democracies. The literature offers competing claims regarding the effect of the mode of transitions on the duration of post-transitional democracy. This paper reconciles these claims by proposing three modes of democratic transitions – military dominance (MD), popular sanction (PS) and consensual power-transfer (CPT), and arguing CPT leads to subsequent democracies that last longer, followed by PS and then MD. MD fails to incorporate the military into democratic systems, thus making it more likely for ensuing democracies to suffer coups while PS enables regime insiders to change democratic rules without hindrance or enables antecedent insiders to return to power through an organised armed conflict. CPT transforms authoritarian successor parties, which act as the strongest check on the government’s power, thus decreasing the likelihood of collapse. This paper verifies hypotheses using data on nascent democracies between 1945 and 2017, employing a mixed methods research, and thus, contributes to comparative studies of transitional modes of democratisation, and their legacies of military roles, inter-communal conflict, and party dynamics on the longevity of the democracy.

2019	85898	649	Undemocratic Regime Types and Immunization Against Extremism	This paper examines how the ideology of undemocratic regimes still has an impact on post-transitional democracies, suppressing or exacerbating extremist parties of the same ideology, depending on the typology of regime: authoritarian or totalitarian. Existing studies on undemocratic regimes and democratization greatly overlook how the ideology of past regimes affects post-transitional party systems, particularly neglecting the specific role of ideology in shaping the ideological landscape of extremism in contemporary party systems. This paper argues that the ideology and the type of undemocratic regime are crucial factors in determining how political systems suppress or exacerbate the emergence of extremist political parties with an ideology akin to the one displayed by the past regime, after democratization. The empirical model shows that while in former totalitarian regimes there are strong extremist parties belonging to the same ideological family as that of the past regime, in authoritarian regimes, which lack a blueprint ideology, the same does not happen. Former authoritarian regimes seem to be immune to extremisms ideologically similar to the one displayed formerly. Lastly, the effect on democratic regimes is neutral.	Catarina Leão	NA
2019	81506	133	Immigrant Sentiment and Labour Market Vulnerability: Economic Perceptions of Immigration in Dualized Labour Markets	Recent years have seen an increase in concerns that labour market vulnerability and economic performance might be interacting to foment more polarized opinions about immigration. This article uses European Social Survey data from 23 countries to explore this potential relationship, examining attitudes about the economic impact of immigration. In doing so, it seeksto investigate how the link between labour market vulnerability and anti-immigrant sentiment may be shaped by both resource scarcity (in the economy as a whole) and job scarcity (on the labour market). Findings from the analysis are twofold. First, labour market vulnerability is indeed correlated with more negative beliefs about the economic contribution of immigrants, even controlling for related factors such as education and contract type. Second, this effect appears to be moderated by GDP per capita (though not unemployment rates), with labour market insiders and outsiders holding more distinct attitudes in higher GDP countries; thus, although attitudes towards the economic contribution of immigrants are generally more negative in poorer countries, labour market vulnerability contributes to greater opinion polarization in stronger economies.

2019	85971	687	Effect of Immigrant Enfranchisement on Naturalization Rates: Evidence from Switzerland	How does the extension of local-level voting rights to non-citizen immigrants affect their incentives to naturalize? Using citizenship data from Switzerland and a synthetic control methodological design, I find that immigrants who live in municipalities without citizenship requirements for participation in canton-level elections are more likely to naturalize in subsequent years than immigrants who do not. These results suggest that, rather than lowering the perceived value of citizenship, the extension of subnational voting rights to non-citizens furthers their political incorporation. I speculate that subnational enfranchisement promotes immigrants’ sense of national belonging and stake in their host country, which, in turn, encourages them to seek full membership in the polity through naturalization.

2019	86317	925	What Makes an Immigrant “Illegal”? Experimental Evidence from Europe and the US	Quantitative political science scholarship on anti-immigrant attitudes does not often distinguish legal from undocumented immigration or examine the perceived association between immigrants and crime (Wright et al. 2016). This is an important omission as public opinion surveys show that anti-immigrant attitudes diverge significantly across the legal/ illegal divide (Jones 2017; Pew Research Center 2018). This paper seeks to explain the role that legality plays in driving anti-immigrant attitudes. To answer these questions, we designed an original conjoint experiment, which was embedded into a nationally- representative survey of the US, UK, Germany and France (Total N = 26,501). This experiment includes three attributes relating to diversity and social integration and three attributes relating to illegality (i.e., how the individual entered the country, whether or not the individual violated visa requirements, and individuals' criminal activity). We, then, ask respondents to evaluate the State's enforcement priorities given these profiles. We find that the deportation preferences vary across countries; while European countries are most likely to prioritize the migrant’s level of integration, Americans focus on the migrant’s criminal history.

2019	86482	1055	The salience and politicization of immigration during the refugee crisis in Germany, Austria and Switzerland	The 2015 refugee-crisis had a major impact on election outcomes across Europe in the past years. However, we lack systematic studies how short-term ruptures like this crisis impact the long-term transformation of party competition that has been underway for several decades.This study analyses the changing dynamics of immigration salience and politicization before, during, and after the refugee-crisis in Austria, Switzerland and Germany to adress the interaction of long-term trends and temporary peaks. In descriptive and regression analyses, we focus on the behaviour of mainstream parties and how they react to internal pressures by right-wing challengers and external pressures. Using close to 20,000 immigration-related press releases, we show not only how the attention to and politicization of immigration changed, but also shed light on the causes of these dynamics, such as pressure by right-wing challengers, refugee arrivals, and public attention towards the topic.Our findings contribute to the broader literature on the transformation of party competition and the impact of radical right success on mainstream parties and test the generalizability of these findings by zooming in on a period of change.

2019	88618	1259	Foreigners in hostile hinterlands: Local exposure to refugees and right-wing support in Eastern Germany after the 2015 refugee crisis	How does first-time, local exposure to foreigners influence attitudes towards them and support for right-wing parties? The article exploits a natural experiment: the allocation of refugees to municipalities in the rural hinterlands of Eastern Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015. Similar to rural regions elsewhere, the area has seen a major shift towards the political right. The paper relies on an innovative design, in which 1,320 German citizens were sampled from 236 closely-matched municipalities, only half of which received refugees. Survey and behavioral measures show widespread anti-immigrant sentiments and strong support for right-wing parties, but these are not affected by the physical allocation of refugees in a municipality. Our results are corroborated by the analysis of a range of mechanisms related to our outcomes that are left unaffected by local exposure to refugees. If anything the presence of refugees served as a `reality check' for both right- and left-leaning individuals, making them more moderate. We conclude that the allocation of refugees in areas without significant prior history of immigration has had little bearing on anti-immigrant attitudes and right-wing support.	Max Schaub	NA
2019	84774	360	Economic Growth, Income Inequality, and Anti-establishment Attitudes	Does the combination of economic growth and increasing income inequality induce anti-establishment attitudes and polarization? Although growth and income inequality exert direct effects on political attitudes and voting, we argue that their combination induces feelings of deprivation, reduces the levels of trust towards the system of government and, subsequently, enhances the electoral prospects of populist candidates. Our hypothesis is that when the pie grows bigger (increases in GDP growth) but the individual share of the pie doesn’t (income Inequality stays the same or increases), citizens will become more likely to express feelings of deprivation, lower trust towards the system, and thus will be more likely to abandon mainstream parties or candidates for smaller –radical- parties. We test this question using county and state level economic indicators linked with geo-coded public opinion data and actual election results.	Asli Cansunar	NA
2019	85616	514	Unequal We Feel - Heterogeneous Effects of Local Development in Africa	Economic conditions in developing countries have improved substantially. However, we also observe growing inequality. This raises the question who wins and who loses from economic development, which is also important for the literature connecting development with political attitudes and behavior. I argue that development affects people differently: while higher development levels offer economic chances for high-skilled individuals, the low-skilled do not reap the same benefits. To evaluate their welfare people compare themselves to others, which yields adverse results for the high-skilled in lagging economic environments and the low-skilled in the most developed areas. I focus on local development, as development levels within countries vary substantially. By combining geo-coded Afrobarometer data and night lights, I am able to measure development levels of people's immediate environments. Bayesian multilevel analysis confirms that high-skilled people are most dissatisfied with their well-being at low levels of economic development. The low-skilled in highly developed environments instead are discontent with living conditions and economic security. This suggests that development does not increase well-being for everyone and points to a potential source of economic grievances and political instability.	Tabea Palmtag	NA
2019	86291	906	Socio-Economic Biases in Ideological Congruence and Participatory Disparities: Developing and Developed Democracies over the Past 5 Decades	Are disparities in substantive representation linked to similar gaps in political participation? Since the association was first posited by Lijphart (1997), support has been mainly circumstantial. Poorer voters get worse representation (Giger et al., 2012; Gilens, 2012), and are also less likely to participate in elections (Gallego, 2015), but the two phenomena have yet to be directly linked. I build on the pioneering work of Lupu and Warner (2018) by investigating whether turnout disparities between socio-economic groups are associated with representation disparities for the same groups. I rely on an original merged data set of 190 election studies, where voters rate themselves and parties on a Left-Right axis. Using the “Earth Mover’s Distance” (Lupu et al., 2017) as a measure of ideological congruence, I relate this to the income-based or education-based turnout gap, obtained from election-specific turnout models. Preliminary results suggest that turnout disparities explain the overall ideological congruence in the system, but do not explain disparities in congruence between groups. The results open up the possibility that turnout gaps might not be as damaging for representation as first hypothesized.	Constantin Manuel Bosancianu	NA
2019	86578	1142	The Relative Impact of Wealth Inequality on Social and Political Trust: A Global Analysis	Whereas income inequality has been stable in many countries, wealth inequality is increasing. Additionally, the recent economic crisis and global political upheavals underscore the consequences of wealth dispersion for societal and political ills. Nevertheless, scholars of social and political disaffection have only focused on income inequality across OECD countries. This paper’s contribution is threefold: (1) extending the theoretical link between inequality and social trust to political trust (2) examining the impact of wealth inequality on subjective orientations, which no study has done before, and (3) taking a global approach to offer a more complete account of the economic and political contingencies that may moderate these relationships. We combine public opinion data from Barometer and Value surveys across 132 countries to assess the relative importance of wealth inequality on social and political trust for different levels of democracy or GDP, while controlling for income inequality to minimize missing variable bias. The results suggest that in democracies wealth inequality seems more of a burden, but the negative effect of wealth inequality on the fabric of society is mitigated in richer countries.

2019	84931	382	Divine Taxes: How Does Religion Shape Redistributive Preferences in the Muslim World?	How does religion shape Muslims’ redistributive preferences? Although evidence from developed democracies show that religious citizens are less supportive of redistribution, this paper documents the opposite relationship among religious Muslims using a sample of more than 500,000 survey respondents. Religious Muslims express aversion towards income inequality and support for state welfare. Despite that, they also hold negative attitudes towards state taxation. Theoretically, I argue that these seemingly inconsistent attitudes can be explained by the Islamic system of divine rewards and punishment. Islam demands redistribution from followers, independent of state taxation. When religious incentives for redistribution are high, religious citizens shift their resources towards religious redistributive mechanism away from state taxation. I formalize this argument to explain the religious roots of Muslims’ economic policy preferences. Empirically, using a novel identification strategy, I show that changing religious incentives for redistribution leads to a significant rise in support for equality and welfare policies by 7 percent, while decreasing tax compliance by 3 percent among religious Muslims. Finally, the paper outlines implications on public goods provision and state welfare policies in religious societies.	Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed	NA

Using an original dataset that combines geographical, demographic, institutional, and political trends of Italian municipalities from late 1990s to 2010s, the paper provides a unique insight in the creation and development of populist parties. The rich dataset allows us to test multiple existing theories on the rise of populism and the identity of populist voters. We identify the key features that predicted the grassroots creation and success of 5 Star Movement lists across Italy.	Hadas Aron, Chiara Superti	NA
2019	82238	156	Populism from Within: Putin & the rise of Russian populism	Populism identifies elites as the root cause of many ills plaguing society. Incumbents, as architects of the existing status quo, are definitionally elites. This makes it difficult for incumbents to lament current conditions without admitting to their own inept governance. Not surprisingly, then, the development of populism from within is rare. Where it has appeared, however, it is very instructive. President Vladimir Putin did not come to power in Russia as a populist leader. In this paper, we examine his gradual embrace of populism during his second and third terms to identify the conditions under which incumbents can turn to populism as a strategy for regime stabilization. We argue that populism from within is most likely to succeed when incumbents can credibly identify the opposition as “the corrupt elite” that threatens the ability of “the pure people” to express their political will. Such a framing of current woes allows the incumbent to appeal to a glorious past, which they argue was glorious precisely because it was devoid of such deleterious elements, without incurring blame for the consequences of their policies.

2019	86478	1052	What’s in a Buzzword? Populism and its Host Ideologies in Political Science Research	The scale of conceptual disagreement regarding populism within the political science discipline has not been hitherto identified through rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the field. This article addresses this issue in two parts. A quantitative review of 847 peer-reviewed journal articles from the period 2004-18 using a ‘text-as-data’ approach first reveals the extent to which populism is tackled with different approaches, methods, and ontologies. Following the famous analogy of Almond (1988), different sects of populist scholars are shown to sit at ‘separate tables’, varying by geographical region, following divergent research agendas and their own distinct conceptions of populism. Focusing on European populism research, we then conduct a qualitative analysis of 250 journal articles regarding the character and consequences of populism in Europe. Systematic analysis reveals a prevalent overstatement of the significance of the ‘thin’ populist ideology, at the expense of the host ideology. We conclude with guidance for future research: to distinguish populism from “ what it travels with” (Rovira Kaltwasser et al. 2017: 18) and where to engage more with the dynamic interlinkages between populism and its host ideologies.

2019	85258	432	The context of the relationship between right-wing Eurosceptic vote and anti-globalization attitudes	According to previous literature, there is a connection between the vote for right-wing Eurosceptic parties and negative attitudes towards both immigration (cultural globalization) and neo-liberal policies (economic globalization). In this paper, we theoretically and empirically assess the extent to which the positive effect of anti-immigration and anti-neoliberal attitudes on right-wing Eurosceptic vote is moderated by two contextual factors at the regional level: unemployment rates (socio-economic factor) and immigration levels (socio-cultural factor). We use rounds 4-8 of the European Social Survey together with contextual data from Eurostat, and we estimate logistic multilevel random intercept models in which individuals are nested in region-years. The main empirical results show that the anti-immigration dimension behind right-wing Eurosceptic vote is stronger in regional contexts with high levels of immigration and in regions with low unemployment rates; by contrast, the anti-neoliberal dimension behind this vote is only existent in regions with low levels of immigration and in regional contexts with medium and high levels of unemployment.

2019	82207	153	Taking It Personal?: Investigating Personalism as an Autocratic Survival Strategy	Personalist autocracy is on the rise globally. The increasing tendency of dictators to concentrate personal power has major implications for the political stability of autocracies. However, the nature of this impact is unclear. On the one hand, previous research has highlighted regime personalization as an autocratic survival strategy and linked it to a reduction in the likelihood of coups. On the other hand, dictators’ purges of elite rivals have been linked to an increase in the likelihood of civil war. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings by first developing a common theoretical framework and subsequently testing this framework in a time-series cross-sectional analysis. The paper argues that regime personalization involves a conscious trade-off between different kinds of threats to a dictator’s rule. By increasing the degree of personalization, dictators reduce their vulnerability to elite threats while at the same time increasing their vulnerability to mass-based threats. Consequently, personalist dictators are likely to survive in power unless their rule is destabilized by an exogenous shock (e.g., a regional protest wave) that increases the likelihood of mass-based mobilization.

2019	84761	359	Why do incumbents invite electoral observation missions?	In recent years we witnessed two interrelated phenomena, the spread of elections around the world (even in non-democracies) and the expansion of election monitoring (intended to improve electoral quality). While we have a relatively good understanding of electoral manipulation, some aspects of election monitoring still need investigation. Electoral observation missions (EOM) do not occur unilaterally, they have to be invited by incumbents. It is unclear though why rulers, particularly those wanting to use electoral manipulation, would be willing to invite monitors and risk receiving a negative report. This paper addresses this question and argues that the decision to invite EOM relates to trade exposure. Incumbents that want to boost trade may need to exhibit to partners that their regime is open to scrutiny and thus have an incentive to invite monitors. This decision reduces rulers’ capacity to cheat, which creates a trade-off between surviving in power by manipulating elections and surviving in power by relying on economic performance. We test this argument empirically with a dataset combining monitoring and trade data in non-established democracies around the world.	Nasos Roussias	NA
2019	86582	1146	The Value of Popular Input for Unelected Local Leaders: Evidence from China	Established literature suggests that in nondemocratic regimes, popular input can impart information critical for resolving (1) the dictators’ dilemma of identifying public preferences and (2) the agency dilemma of monitoring the bureaucracy. However, little is known about what kinds of popular input truly catch the attention of unelected leaders. To field this question, we collected a unique database of local leaders’ written feedback on citizens’ complaints, suggestions, and inquiries in China. We propose to first compare the issue areas of popular input that received and did not receive leaders’ feedback, trying to evaluate if the attention of local leaders is congruent with residents’ preferences. Second, taking advantage of messages labelled as whistleblowing, we plan to test whether local leaders comb through popular input for the misconduct of their subordinates. By shifting the focus from how street-level bureaucrats respond to citizens’ messages to how unelected leaders winnow such information, this study contributes to a refined understanding about the value of popular input in nondemocratic regimes.

2019	91144	1264	Strategies of dissent and electoral processes in autocracies	Elections, despite being a defining feature of democratic governance, are used by autocracies around the world. These allow dictators to co-opt the opposition, gain international legitimacy, mobilize support bases for the regime and obtain information about regime strength. Against this background, the paper examines how popular mobilization against the regime impacts decisions to hold competitive elections and their outcome. It argues that autocracies are more likely to hold elections when faced with popular mobilization as a mean to release social pressure and in the expectation of reinforcing regime legitimacy. It proposes that nonviolent resistance is more likely to force autocracies to hold competitive elections because of its increased ability to impose governance costs. Further, nonviolent resistance can act as a focal point for uniting the opposition against the regime and lead to leadership changes. Finally, the paper also posits that autocracies’ propensity to hold competitive elections is influenced by regional nonviolent dissent. The empirical analysis uses data on social campaigns from NAVCO 2.0 and elections from NELDA and offers support to these propositions.	Roman-Gabriel Olar	NA
2019	85584	508	Learning Conflict Duration: Insights from Predictive Modelling	Why do some conflicts last longer than others? The bifurcated nature of conflict studies, based on the notion that civil and interstate wars are qualitatively different, has so far largely prevented studies from including both types of conflict in the same dataset. Thus, empirical evidence is lacking as to whether the same explanations for longevity apply to both types of conflict, or they are indeed separate phenomena. This paper expands on the Cunningham and Lemke (2013) study on combining civil and interstate wars by including a large number of predictors taken from the rich civil war literature. The proposed framework unpacks the bargaining failure framework into three components governing power projection over distance: material capability, politics, and geography. Using predictive modelling techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble methods, I demonstrate that the majority of predictive covariates of war duration are indeed common to both civil and interstate wars. Further, in most cases, the direction of the effect holds across types, suggesting that the underlying mechanism operates in a similar fashion.	Gokhan Ciflikli	NA
2019	86610	1166	Rocket Science? Forecasting Palestinian Attacks on Israel	Do conflict processes exhibit repeating patterns over time? And if so, can we exploit the recurring shapes of the time series to forecast the evolution of conflict? Here we study escalation patterns using recent machine-learning methods derived from information geometry, clustering, and pattern recognition in time series, including geometric-based approaches. Our goal is to supplement typical correlation-based approaches with clustering and prototyping methods to extract shapes and ideally better understand the patterns of escalation into war. We apply these methods to a particularly challenging task: forecasting the precise timing of Palestinian rocket and mortar attacks on Israel. Using four years of minute-level prices for 500 Israeli stocks, we find that financial asset prices react on average 30 minutes ahead of the launch of a rocket. We validate our result in a true out-of-sample manner. Using live market data and minute-level rocket attack data from Israel’s home front command, we publicly broadcast our forecasts in real time for every minute of every day and will continue to do so until the conference, when we will report our results.

2019	86632	1181	From Black Box to Building Blocks: Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms into Probablistic Generative Model for Conflict Prediction and Understanding	There has been an increasing focus on conflict predicting and forecasting across international relations. However, researchers have been forced to choose between either simple, low performing conceptually-justified models or flexible, high performing black box algorithms. Here we suggest that black box algorithms can be used to improve not only conflict forecasting metrics, but also human understanding (and the formalization) of conflict processes. Using PRIO grid-cell level data, we are able to show how the relative improvements in prediction from a black box model can illuminate missing pieces from existing analytical generative models; suggesting new parameterizations. In particular, we learn that a Bayesian mixture model can close the performance gap with ML models. Our results highlight how advances in machine learning can accelerate social science research on conflict prediction.	Michael Colaresi	NA
2019	86310	920	Identifying Changes in Protracted Conflicts: A New Geographical Unit of Analysis	In this paper, we present a new geographical unit of analysis, “setting of organized violence”, for identifying changes in protracted conflicts across time and space. These conflicts often comprise several entangled conflicts, spill across borders, comprise several contested issues, and feature new spin-off conflicts. Current units of analysis used for quantitative conflict research, such as states, actors’ dyads, and conflict zones fail to track such complex evolutions as they slice them into smaller units. For example, the protracted conflict in the Horn of Africa consists of fights for resources among various clans, Islamist struggles, foreign interventions, and regional power disputes, yet macro-level studies tend to treat these intertwined phenomena as individual conflicts. We provide a more robust methodology by selecting closely related smaller conflicts, the violent actors involved in them, and identifying relevant incidents of violence. To see internal variation in each conflict setting, we add a data layer consisting of PRIO-GRIDs which provides us with socio-economic indicators for each individual grid. The new geographical unit of analysis enables us to trace changes in conflicts which would be otherwise overlooked.	Katerina Tkacova	NA
2019	88439	1257	Conflict as an Identification Strategy	The consequences of international and domestic conflict for political and economic outcomes is an important concern for scholars and policymakers. But establishing causal relations with the data typically available is an effort that is plagued by endogeneity concerns, thus restricting the scope of empirical conflict studies. A prominent feature of most theories of conflict is uncertainty, which implies an inherent randomness that is not predictable ex ante to combatants or researchers. Consequently, there may be random variation which can provide a source of exogenous variation for some political and economic outcomes related to conflict. We identify two distinct sources of risk that produce qualitatively different kinds of natural experiments. First, incidence risk is the uncertainty regarding whether a crisis escalates into violence, and arises from private information between potential combatants. Second, result risk arises from imperfect information about the ultimate outcome of conflict, which implies that the initiation of conflict essentially triggers a lottery. We discuss the kinds of natural experiments that emerge from these sources of uncertainty and ways they can (and cannot) be used.	Jessica Sun	NA
2019	85972	688	Democracy, Reputation for Resolve, and Civil Conflict	There is a long-running disagreement about how regime type affects a country's ability to project resolve. Specifically, does being a democracy help or hurt a country's reputation for resolve? To provide new insight into this fundamental question, I directly estimate a state's reputation for resolve by fitting a dynamic game of reputation building to civil conflict data. I find that while governments tend to have stronger reputations for resolve than the rebels they face, democracies are seen as much less likely to be resolved both prior to and during conflict than their autocratic counterparts. Despite this gap, both democracies and autocracies a discrete increase in their reputation for resolve once conflict begins. As such, these findings contrast with a large literature on democratic advantages in interstate conflict while simultaneously providing evidence for audience costs in both democratic and autocratic regimes.

2019	82250	158	Explaining Militancy among Marginalized Minorities	When does militancy arise among marginalized minorities? This paper addresses this question by presenting a novel, understudied dynamic and developing a formal model to illustrate the political conditions that influence minority militant mobilization. Marginalized minorities often face the threat of indiscriminate retaliation if any violent transgressions occur from within their community. Low levels of protection from this threat would incentivize minority members to police their group in order to prevent militancy from emerging within their community. The strategic tensions involved in this protection-group policing dynamic occur within the minority group and between the minority group and the state. I thus develop a formal model that investigates how state capacity and state willingness influence minority militant mobilization. Counterintuitively, I use the model to show how a low-capacity state can actually provide an environment that is less conducive to minority-linked militancy than a high capacity state.

2019	85796	583	Professional Soldiers, Conscripts, and Insurgents: The Role of Military Manpower Procurement in Regime Politics	How does conscription influence civil conflict? This paper considers the strategic rationale and effects of conscription upon intrastate conflict processes. We argue that because conscription alters the outside option of citizens deciding which party to support during civil conflict, it has thus far unrecognized implications for intrastate conflict. In particular, we explore how conscription influences insurgent recruitment, civil conflict initiation, and conflict duration. Using a selectorate model of regime politics, we derive the preferences of ruling elites over military manpower procurement systems subject to budget and insurgency constraints. The military labor market is modeled as a duopsony between a rebel and a standing army with elastic labor supply. Citizen types are divided by civilian productivity and enfranchisement status. While insurgents have no access to the formal economy, the standing army is financed out of tax revenues and the state's ability to conscribe military labor. Optimal levels of conscription are then derived with respect to the level of both the internal and external threat. We illustrate the dynamics of the model with cases of conscription in Syria and Colombia.	Nikitas Konstantinidis	NA
2019	86424	1010	Strategic information transmission in civil wars: Conflict networks in the shadow of mediation	We provide a novel n-player perspective on how information transmission about external actors’ intention to enforce peace agreements leads to the escalation or de-escalation of armed conflicts. Our formal model analyzes how external actors’ signals to intervene can initiate escalation or de-escalation cascades. More specifically, external actors can differ in the extent to which they are expected to enforce peace agreements and how noisy that signal is. Actors update their beliefs about the enforcement type based on the initial signal, but also condition their behavior on the other actors’ interpretation of the signal. Very noisy signals can lead to highly heterogeneous responses in conflict networks, which increase the risk of escalation cascades. We propose that belligerents escalate fighting when they believe a mediator will enforce a potential peace agreement. However, less credible but noisy signals by interveners can also lead to the same escalation dynamics. Using data on intrastate conflicts in Africa for the years 1993-2007 we find support for the proposed escalation patterns.	Tatjana Stankovic	NA
2019	86520	1089	Street Level Autocrats: Private Preferences and the Logic of Nonviolent Revolutions	Violent uprisings last about two and a half times as long as non-violent campaigns. Brutal repression of a non-violent campaign can end the conflict quickly. Widespread defection among the security forces also leads to a relatively quick end to a non-violent campaign. To better understand how strategic non-violence works, we analyze two games, which are in turn, strategically linked as a single game. The first involves the mobilization of civil society. The second is about the behavior of the security forces. Both games feature the role of private preferences. We develop a game theoretic model that shows the conditions under which the mobilization of civil society is likely to lead to defection or principled shirking among members of the security apparatus. Private preferences affect all aspects of the game, affecting civil society and how well the autocratic coalition holds together. The model explains why civil resistance works. We test the implications of the model statistically, using duration analyses, and find support for the key propositions.	Scott Gates	NA
2019	83356	218	Shades of peace: Perception of security in Sri Lanka	How do people in post-war societies perceive the nature of peace? The absence of war does not automatically translate into individuals feeling at peace, while peace itself is a multidimensional concept. We aim to understand how individuals assess political stability, personal security, and freedom of speech. We suggest that war experience, media consumption and views on media freedom, as well as how individuals evaluate the performance of the state shape these perceptions of different shades of peace. Using original survey data from a representative sample of 2,000 respondents in Sri Lanka in 2018, we show that individuals can view political stability, personal security and freedom of speech very differently. Our findings suggest that clear winners of the past conflict are not necessarily the most optimistic about the quality of post-conflict peace.	Sabine Carey	NA
2019	86059	734	Emotion Shift and Transitional Justice: A Micro- and Macro-level Effects in Justice Debates in the Balkans.	To deliver reconciliation among former foes, transitional justice practices have to address conflict-induced emotional mobilisation. Feelings of anger, distrust and blame need to be replaced by empathy to facilitate social repair and constructive engagement across ethnic lines. Scholars have studied the role of emotions in the onset and conduct of conflict, but it is under-researched in transitional justice despite the centrality of emotions for individual and community-level recovery. We address this lacunae in the scholarship and investigate whether and how emotions change during transitional justice debates. We account for the ethnic distance of former opponents in a regional conflict, and check wider societal emotional effects of these transitional justice debates. This is the first study to empirically link micro- and macro-level emotional shift through transitional justice-seeking. The study applies quantitative text analysis to a corpus of 1 million words of multi-lingual transcripts of transitional justice debates in the Balkans, in combination with a six-country survey of some 6,000 respondents. The paper makes a contribution to the study of emotions in politics generally, and in the politics of post-conflict peace-building, particularly.	Tom Paskhalis	NA
2019	86091	759	Pulled Together or Torn Asunder? Community Cohesion after Symmetric and Asymmetric Civil War	Does war affect community cohesion? A common view in the literature is that war increases cohesion among people on the same side of conflict, exacerbating distance between people on the opposite sides. However, conflict sides are not always observable during war. Two types of conflict may vary in this respect – symmetric and asymmetric war. While symmetric war is fought with relatively conventional means between clearly defined camps, in asymmetric war the weaker side adopts guerrilla tactics and boundaries between camps become blurred. In this study, I compare community cohesion in the villages exposed to these two types of conflict, using survey data from 224 Colombian villages. The analysis shows that symmetric war increases cohesion measured as participation in community organizations. By contrast, asymmetric war has a detrimental effect on trusting behaviors. These results support the conjecture that asymmetric war generates denunciation-driven victimization of civilians, contributing to unobservable community fractures.	Krzysztof Krakowski	NA
2019	86158	809	When Do States Apologize for Past Atrocities? Explaining Interstate Apologies for War Crimes	When do states apologize for atrocities they committed in the past? Many historical crimes continue to severely hurt bilateral relations, but states rarely offer official apologies to their victims. Existing literature on the topic is limited to a few cases such as Germany's apologies after 1945. Here we address this gap with new data and theory on state apologies. Firstly, we have collected a new dataset that codes, for every war-crime committed in an interstate war during the 20th century, (a) whether an official apology was offered and (b) the characteristics of that apology. Secondly, we use this dataset to explore what factors explain if and when a state offers an apology to another state. In particular, we hypothesize that two political factors, the relative severity of violations between two states (``balance of violations') and domestic political transitions, will determine apology timing. Our statistical analysis and case studies support the view that these political factors explain state apologies better than alternative explanations such as time passed and the relative economic and military power of victims.

2019	86644	1187	Security Sector Reform as Coup Proofing	Post-conflict regimes face the difficult task of providing security across territory that, immediately prior, was insecure and contested. Peacebuilding practitioners advocate for integration of former insurgents into state security forces as a means to improve security provision in formerly contested areas. This security sector reform introduces a new risk for the government. Integrated former insurgents may use their position inside the security forces to attempt to overthrow the regime. Integration might increase stability by improving security provision or decrease stability by making internal threats more likely. I present a model where a regime screens insurgents, choosing whether to integrate based on the relative magnitude of external and internal threats. While high-skill former insurgents improve the quality of security provision, they are more likely to succeed in taking control of the state. Less capable former insurgents present a lower risk, but are less likely to be effective security providers. The government's own capacity and external pressures influence the tradeoff between these two types. I show this screening process can lead to either power sharing or consolidation of power by an autocrat.	Jessica Sun	NA
2019	78363	72	Rebellion in the UK: the impact of inner-city violence on public spending	Urban riots may prompt policy-makers to address the problems of inner cities and of black youth in particular. An extensive statistical literature suggests that American cities that rioted in the 1960s enjoyed special treatment from local and governments (Fording 1997). In the UK, the 1980s riots highlighted an inequality that continues to this day. We argue that a social policy response is likely in the form of urban regeneration projects and housing, with funds being micro-targeted to the areas where the rioters live. An alternative response is to increase targeted repression, a trade-off echoed in the international relations literature (Moore 1998, 2000; Klein and Regan, 2018). We use reports of riots in both national and local newspapers to code their location and intensity and merge this information with data on local spending patterns that are geographically concentrated, including urban grants and housing redevelopments. We take areas of rioting in London such as Brixton and Tottenham, and use natural experimental cut-offs to generate inferences.	Gabriel Leon, Peter John	NA
2019	85652	524	Structural factors or contagion? The Swing riots and the drivers of social unrest.	Structural factors and contagion are the main drivers of social unrest, but which is more important? To address this question we consider the English Swing riots of 1830-31. The rural nature of the riots and the limited mobility of agricultural workers means that we can use clearly-observable spatial variation in a large number of structural factors to estimate their role in triggering the riots. We then quantify the importance of these factors relative to that of contagion. We find that factors related to the type of agriculture and the capacity for organization were significant in triggering riots, and that contagion on average magnified their impact by a factor of 2.65. Our historical data allow us to address a key question in the conflict literature, while improving our understanding of a period that was critical to the development of British democracy.

2019	85817	597	Does Nonviolent Civil Resistance Really Work? Revisiting the Causal Effects of Nonviolent Protest	Prominent studies hold that nonviolent resistance movements are more successful than violent ones at bringing down dictatorships. This notion has come to be considered a stylized fact in the literature. Yet, we highlight that even if there is an observed correspondence between nonviolent movements and regime change, the causal relationship between the two remains highly uncertain. For instance, tactical choices pertaining to use of violence is endogenous to unmeasured factors that are also related to regime change. We detail several threats to drawing valid causal inferences from extant analysis on the relationship between nonviolent tactics and democratization. First, we detail the problem theoretically and discuss factors that could plausibly generate a spurious relationship. Second, we propose ways to measure and otherwise account for (hitherto unmeasured) confounders, and, subsequently, conduct a battery of tests assessing the sensitivity of established results on the nonviolence--democratization link. These empirical analyses, accounting for the underlying selection processes through which nonviolent and violent resistance occurs and are reported, allow us to better assess when and why specific tactics are relatively effective in challenging state authority.

2019	86490	1062	Enemies Within: Labeling and Collaboration with Rival Authorities	An established body of scholarship suggests that those who collaborate with enemies in social conflict settings risk severe sanctions. Once identified as defectors to an enemy, they may be ostracized, imprisoned, tortured or even killed. Civilian defection has to date been predicated on their relationship to exogenous violent actors, with a focus on collaborators as the outcome of interest. Yet what constitutes defection is construed endogenously, based on a range of accepted and unaccepted behavior, as well as perceptions about where individuals fall within that range. Broad or lax labeling of defection may result in an over-identification of collaborators, and vice-versa. Further, labeling people as defectors has implications for behavior: they may be driven towards conformity in fear of punishment, or “flip” towards defection in acceptance of their label. This paper develops a computational model to account for diverse patterns of defection, and illustrates these mechanisms with anecdotal evidence from the German Democratic Republic and the Palestinian Territories. As a next step, the model is seeded and validated with micro-level data constructed from archival records and interview material.	Mirko Reul	NA
2019	85916	660	Changing levels of wellbeing inequality and inter-group conflict in Africa. New sub-national evidence from the early 2000s	Despite persistent wide-spread poverty, there is growing recognition that large parts of Africa have seen relatively sustained improvements in economic and social wellbeing. While earlier debates have mostly focused on conceptual issues arising from these developments, such as the problem of defining Africa’s ‘emerging middle classes’, there has been less research on how improving living standards have affected existing status relations between ethnic and religious groups. The paper draws on unusually detailed subnational census and survey data from 6 African countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Zambia), to trace group-specific wellbeing trends at district level for the first decades of the 2000s. The resulting evidence is combined with existing measures of groups’ access to political resources from the Ethnic Power Relations database and geocoded information on local conflict events (ACLED), to test theories of relative deprivation/ethnic grievance in the ethnic conflict literature. Groups’ socio-economic status is defined by education, occupation, and household assets. The paper also draws on historical conflict data and Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas to address endogeneity concerns and to distinguish short-term from long-term effects.	Frank-Borge Wietzke	NA
2019	86043	720	Does Non-Violent Communication (NVC) Increase Demand for and Access to Customary Justice for Women? Experimental Evidence from a UN Women's Program in South Central Somalia.	As formal institutional change is often slow or unrealistic, scholars and policymakers have sought to produce positive change via informal institutional alternatives. However, while strengthening informal institutions may produce better outcomes overall, justice for marginalized groups may worsen if informal institutions reinforce existing inequalities. We conduct a RCT to evaluate a U.N. program that aims to increase justice for women in conflict-ridden South Central Somalia by targeting norms, attitudes and behaviors of traditional community powerbrokers from 40 villages with weak formal institutions: women leaders, and religious and clan elders who preside over the informal justice system. This ongoing intervention spanning 9 months teaches participants methods of non-violent communication (NVC). Through role-plays, mixed gender sessions, and interactive activities, participants determine how to apply NVC generally and specifically to the provision of customary justice for women in their communities, particularly regarding domestic violence. Participants are then trained as NVC facilitators to disseminate learnings to existing institutions and to non-leaders in villages. Administrative data, text-as-data analysis, behavioral measures, lab-in-the-field and survey experiments supplement baseline and endline surveys with over 800 leaders and non-leaders.

2019	86499	1071	Military Manpower Systems and Economic Inequality	Military conscription is one of the constitutive policy bargains of the modern state. From a political economy perspective, taxation and conscription may be viewed as substitutable instruments of foreign and defense policy. Existing empirical studies focus mostly on the ‘political’ causal link from the choice of military manpower systems (conscript vs. professional) to defense policy as is primarily expressed by the projection of ‘hard’ military force. We, on the other hand, use an original time-series cross-section (TSCS) data set spanning more than five decades (1950-2005) to test the ‘economic’ causal link from economic (and political) inequality to the choice of military manpower system. We find that more egalitarian societies tend to conscript at a higher rate. We capture the richness of cross-country and temporal variation in types of military organization by using continuous meaures of both effective and statutory military conscription, in order to account for the discrepancy between legally enacted (de jure) and effectively enforced (de facto) levels of conscription. Panel-corrected standard errors and distributed lags are estimated to correct for temporal dependence, policy inertia, and other identification concerns.	Henry Pascoe	NA
2019	80029	92	The Reach of Radio: Ending Civil Conflict through Rebel Demobilization	This paper examines the role of FM radio in mitigating and ending violent conflict. We collect original data on radio broadcasts encouraging defections during the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, one of Africa’s longest running conflicts. We provide the first quantitative evaluation of an active counter-insurgency policy. Exploiting random topography-driven variation in radio coverage along with panel variation at the grid-cell level we identify the causal effect of messaging on violence. Broadcasting defection messages reduce fatalities, violence against civilians and clashes with security forces. These reductions are propelledby an increase in defections. In response to manpower losses, the LRA resorts to increased looting for survival. Income shocks measured by exogenous movements in commodity prices have opposing effects on both the conflict and the effectiveness of messaging. Conflict-enhancing (-reducing) commodity price shocks weaken (strengthen) the pacifying effects of defection messaging. This highlights the role of economic incentives in the success of counter-insurgency policies.	Paul Atwell	NA
2019	75664	21	The Composition of Secret Police Forces: Evidence from Autocratic Argentina	Autocracies depend on a capable secret police. Anecdotal evidence, however, often characterizes secret police agents as surprisingly mediocre in skill and intellect. To explain this puzzle, this paper focuses on the incentives underachieving individuals face in bureaucracies. Low-performing officials in hierarchical organizations have little chance of being promoted or filling lucrative positions. To salvage their careers, these officials are willing to carry out burdensome secret police work. Using data on all 4,287 officers who served in autocratic Argentina (1975--83), we study biographic differences between secret police agents and the entire recruitment pool. We find that low-achieving officers were stuck in the regime hierarchy, threatened with discharge, and thus more likely to join in the secret police for future benefits. The paper demonstrates how state bureaucracies breed mundane career concerns that produce willing enforcers and cement violent regimes. This has implications for the understanding of autocratic consolidation and democratic breakdown.	Adam Scharpf	NA
2019	86496	1068	Poverty, Outside Options and Insurgency – Finland in 1918	Who joins insurgencies? We use nearly 30,000 individual casualty records from the 1918 Finnish civil war, an offshoot of the Russian revolution, to answer this question. We show that 1) insurgents mostly came from lower-income occupations such as farm-aids and factory workers 2) there were more overall insurgents in municipalities with lower wages. We use famine labor shocks as an instrumental variable for wages to tease out causality. In municipalities more exposed to the Finnish famine (1866–1868) workers had more bargaining power and higher wages before the civil war, resulting in less insurgency participation. Our results are consistent with outside option logic of insurgency participation. Finally, we study the later electoral and distributional consequences of the conflict.	Matti Mitrunen	NA
2019	89145	1261	Legitimacy and Contested Governance: Evidence from Colombia	On what basis do citizens make decisions about how they wish to begoverned, and what shapes perceptions of legitimate rule? While priorresearch has shed light on patterns of governance in armed conflict,we know little about sources of civilian support in areas wheremultiple armed groups compete. Moreover, most existing researchfocuses exclusively on the behavior of insurgent groups. We extend thefocus on armed group rule to a broader category of armed groups --including dissident rebels and large criminal organizations -- and thepreferences of civilians governed by these groups. Empirically, wefocus on contemporary Colombia, which after a peace agreement wassigned in 2016 between the government and the FARC-EP still faces anarray of competing armed groups. We outline three dimensions that weargue shape civilian attitudes towards armed groups: efficacy,community, and ideology. A conjoint survey experiment in fortyColombian municipalities allow us to assess our understanding of armedgroup legitimacy and governance under contested rule.	Livia Schubiger	NA
2019	85792	579	Individual Logics of Civil Resistance: A conjoint survey experiment	A growing literature considers the impacts of non-violent protest movements, and an emerging consensus is that non-violent protest is more successful when it comes to achieving regime-change and democracy. Yet, studies have yet to consider the individual-level causes of support for non-violent (as opposed to violent) protest against authoritarian governments. We conduct an experiment to eluicidate the factors that lead people to support non-violent over violent protest against authoritarian regimes, focusing on two distinct logics: A strategic logic whereby non-violent protest is supported for instrumental reasons, and a moral logic where non-violence is supported for its intrinsic moral superiority. To elicit responses consistent with these distinct logics, we perform a conjoint survey experiment asking respondents about hypothetical scenarios pitting opposition movements against authoritarian regimes. This is implemented in a convenience sample of 3000 respondents in an online survey, and among respondents in a (smaller) select group of (potential protesters) in a network of democracy-activists from a handful of eastern European countries.

2019	86305	916	Personalism and Technologies of Rebellion: Incentives for Coups and Leader Assassinations	The organizational configuration of authoritarian regimes is often explained as a strategy to change the nature of political threats rulers face. Personalization entails the progressive accumulation of power in the hands of the dictator so that the influence of other organized elites is minimized. However, members of the support group have incentives to act against the dictator to avoid being marginalized by personalistic strongmen. I argue that personalism increases the risk of coups in the short-term, but passed a certain level of power accumulation the risk of coups decreases since rulers establish personal control over the security forces and the state apparatus. However, wwhile the risk of coups is reduced, the risk of assassination attempts increases, as this is a rebellion tool that requires lower levels of coordination and smaller number of plotters. since the overall risk of being assassinated is lower than that of being ousted in a coup, personalization is proved to be survival-efficient.To test these hypotheses, new data on personalism by Geddes et al. (2018) is used as well as data on coup and assassination attempts.	Abel Escribà-Folch	NA
2019	76317	39	Statebuilding, Social Order and Violence: Evidence from U.S. Reconstruction	Why does statebuilding provoke violence? In this paper, we identify a new mechanism through which statebuilding leads to violence. We argue that statebuilding is more likely to cause violence when it succeeds, specifically, when it succeeds in reducing social hierarchies between historically repressed and privileged communities. Effective reductions to long-standing social inequities trigger resentment, anxiety and violence among privileged communities leading to vi- olence against repressed communities. Furthermore, because historically repressed communities work to institutionalize and preserve socio-economic gains arising from statebuilding interven- tions, such gains in status, as well as violence in response to them, persist over the long-term. We quantitatively test our arguments using historical, county-level data on post-U.S. Civil War Reconstruction and we supply both quantitative and qualitative evidence for our mechanisms. Our findings support our theory, and have implications for our understanding of how actors consolidate social orders, and how societies respond to these efforts.	Megan Stewart	NA
2019	86455	1034	The Impact of Political Instability on the Emergence of Terrorism	There seems to be an intuitive link between political instability and the emergence of terrorism. However, empirical evidence on this has been inconclusive and often conflicting. This is because political instability has often been measured through violent acts of civil wars or revolutions. However, using instances of violence to determine terrorist emergence leads to an overlap between the dependent and independent variables. This paper diverges from the existing literature by looking into non-violent indicators of instability that might lead terrorism. In particular, it looks at the interaction between political instability and the opportunities that encourage terrorism. The research argues that political instability is a clear manifestation of the politicization of discontent, and when combined with the opportunities for violence, it has the potential to drive individuals and groups towards terrorism. In order to investigate these claims, the study uses Large-N quantitative analysis for over 130 countries from 1971-2011. The results point towards the importance of certain combinations of factors, such as that of low regime durability and low quality of governance and that of coups and terrorist attacks in neighbours.

2019	85726	552	State Capacity, Encirclement, and Ethnic Insurgency: Theory and Evidence from China	How does the repressive capacity of a state affect the onset of ethnic insurgency? This paper goes beyond the size of the national military and conceptualizes repressive state capacity as a state’s ability to encircle potential minority rebels with an ethno-national population allegiant to the central government. It argues that encirclement can isolate potential rebels from personnel and information transfer across international and domestic borders, and from executing successful retreat in case of an armed confrontation with the government. To test the theory, I compiled a novel dataset on 100 counties and 174 state-sponsored Han Chinese settlements (i.e. bingtuan) in Xinjiang, China. I find that counties surrounded by bingtuan settlements from multiple directions that form an encirclement are associated with significantly fewer violent minority insurgencies. Counties simply having a larger number of Han settlements have not seen fewer violent incidents. The results are robust to controlling for a variety of economic, demographic, and bureaucratic conditions. The paper highlights the sophistication, as opposed to the size, of national security forces in affecting civil conflict onset.	Anna Zhang	NA
2019	86732	1206	Roads to Rule, Roads to Rebel: Relational State Capacity and Conflict in Africa	Weak state capacity is one of the most important explanations of civil conflict. Yet, current conceptualizations of state capacity typically focus only on the state and ignore the relational nature of armed conflict. We argue that conflict arises where relational state capacity is low, that is, where the state has less control over its subjects than local, oftentimes ethnic elites. This occurs in ethnic groups that are poorly accessible from the state capital, but internally highly interconnected. To test this argument, we digitize detailed road maps of Africa, and convert them into a road atlas akin to Google Maps. We measure the accessibility and internal connectedness of groups via travel times obtained from this atlas. To address the endogeneity, we use an instrumental variable design based on road network simulations. We find that low relational state capacity is a key determinant of armed conflict in Africa.

2019	86215	853	Bringing Peace from Above? State Capacity, Civil War De-Escalation and the Composition of the Stock of Military Equiptment	State capacity crucially affects the outset and duration of civil wars. The literature uses indirect measures (such as capacity to tax) to proxy for a state’s ability to fight or prevent civil conflict. In this paper, we employ a new measure of state capacity and test its effect on the (de)escalation of civil violence. We assemble unique data for more than 120 countries, yearly 1989-2010, to estimate the effect of the composition of the military capital stock (e.g. number of attack helicopters vis-à-vis tanks) on the onset, escalation and dynamics of civil conflict. Our main finding is that attack helicopters are associated with the (de)escalation of civil wars. Yet this comes at the price of more indiscriminate violence against civilians.	Tobias Korn	NA
2019	83908	244	What's a 'Good Coup'? Examining International Support for Coups d'État	Over the last decades, a global anti-coup norm emerged, denouncing coups d’état as despicable and inacceptable violations of democratic principles. Many states and international organizations on the global and regional level have adopted far-reaching anti-coup policies, responding to coups with condemnations, diplomatic and economic sanctions. However, not all coups seem to evoke negative reactions: Sometimes, violent take-overs are condoned, welcomed or even actively supported by external actors. Are there “good coups”, take-overs worth to praise rather than to criticize? Which factors drive positive international reactions to coups? Drawing on a unique and novel dataset on international reactions to 133 coup attempts between 1990 and 2017 the paper explores and analyzes patterns of positive reactions to coups with advanced quantitative methods. The results indicate that major violations of democratic principles and human rights, hostility between the ousted government and third-country states as well as ethnic and religious ties are key factors for positive international reactions to coups. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings for a more nuanced policy approach towards coups d’état.	Franziska Hohlstein	NA
2019	85621	515	Going, Going, Gone? Varieties of Dissent and Leader Exit	We examine how popular dissent affects the likelihood that political leaders will lose power, considering different types of dissent in terms of nonviolent/violent primary tactics as well as the magnitude of dissent and likely potential impact. We focus on the interaction between leaders and dissident challengers – who can generate governance costs through non-compliance “from below” – as well as leaders and rival elites, who may create risks of opportunism and challenges to leaders “from within”. We examine in detail how the type of dissident and magnitude of participation influences the likely effects on threats to undermine rulers directly and the risk of challenges from other elites. We argue that non-violent challenges will tend to be more threatening to a leader’s risk of exit than violent challenges, since the magnitude of the challenge increases in the scale and size of the dissident campaign, and nonviolent have a potential for much larger mobilization than violent challenges. We analyze these propositions empirically using data on political leaders as well as dissident campaigns and their characteristics, and find support for our expectations.	Marius Radean	NA
2019	86032	713	Military Autonomy, Political Crisis, and Conflict: Lessons from the Middle East	This paper argues that autonomous military institutions, which retain their independence from political leaders, can play a balancing role during major internal political crises. However, when the military’s autonomy is curtailed, especially on account of “coup proofing” actions implemented by a state’s rulers in the period prior to the crisis, the military cannot maintain the political balance between rulers and their opponents, thereby increasing the risk of internal armed conflict. This paper first explains the five concepts relevant to the discussion (the military; autonomy; political crisis; a balancing role; coup-proofing), then explores their possible interlinkages, and presents several hypotheses. Subsequently, it discusses four relevant cases from the Middle East before and during the Arab revolts of 2010-2011: Lebanon in 1975 and Syria in 2011 to demonstrate the argument, with Egypt in 2011 and Lebanon in 1958 as counterfactuals.

2019	86435	1018	Surviving the Aftermath: Understanding How Military and Political Experience Affect Post-War Political Leadership Survival	Since 1946, one in three political leaders did not manage to stay in power after a civil war. Using an actor-centric perspective, this study uncovers the puzzle why some leaders stay in power while others do not. I argue that prior military and political experience are decisive for political survival. While military experience is beneficial for asserting power in times of threats (e.g., in the immediate aftermath or coups), political experience has a greater impact, the longer the post-war incumbent stays in power. I further expect this effect to be stronger for civil wars that ended in a draw than for those that were won with a decisive victory; in the latter case, the leader is in an advantaged position as post-war compromises are minimized. I test my argument using cross-national data supplemented with biographical information on political leaders for the period between 1946 and 2004. My study presents a novel perspective to analyze the determinants of leadership survival in post-conflict scenarios and contributes to an improved understanding of political dynamics and stability in post-civil war countries.

2019	80390	98	Throwing in the Towel: Democracies and Lost Disputes	While scholarship has long demonstrated that democracies are less likely to fight one another (Maoz and Russett 1993; Oneal and Russett 1999), little attention has been paid to how democracies behave in disputes with one another. We claim that it is important to look at the cases when democracies fight one another to better understand how democractic disputes function. We pay particular attention to lost disputes between democracies to better understand the dynamics of why democracies continue fighting disputes that they ultimately lose. Using survival models, we demonstrate that democracies fighting other democracies tend to fight longer than non-democracies in disputes that they ultimately lose. We theorize that democracies fighting other democracies continue fights they ultimately lose because domestic audience costs in both democratic states encourage democracies to delay the audience costs that come with defeat.

2019	85750	558	The Myth of Casualty Aversion: How Do Casualties Influence States’ Decision to Provide Personnel for UN Peacekeeping Missions?	What influences the size of states’ personnel contributions to UN peacekeeping missions? One common explanation is the risk of casualties among the own ranks states face in these missions. I argue that the interest of political and military elites in a successful accomplishment of the mission, to signal strength and reliability internationally, frequently outweighs these concerns. UN peacekeeping missions are characterized by a rare occurrence of casualties among UN personnel as well as their low relevance domestically. Existing explanations that are derived from contexts of war and solely focus on domestic politics are therefore less important. This new theoretical argument is tested using highly disaggregated data on country-specific casualties and contributions in UN missions between 1990 and 2011. It is the first study that uses such fine-grained data on casualties for the analysis of personnel contributions for UN peacekeeping missions. My preliminary results show a significant increase in states’ contributions when facing casualties. This finding helps to clarify the mixed results in current research on peacekeeping missions and has policy-implications for the planning and organization of UN peacekeeping missions.

2019	75587	13	The Uneven Burden of Peacekeeping: Assessing Variation in Risk-Taking Propensity Across Troop Contributing Countries	UN peacekeeping missions increasingly seek to protect civilians from harm in post-conflict environments. But, UN aims do not always coincide seamlessly with the priorities of troop contributing countries. While financial incentives may motivate troop contributions, peacekeepers likely see risk differently from those that fund operations, and domestic publics may politically punish TCC leaders for peacekeeper casualties. In this study, we ask two questions. First, are troop contributing countries with certain characteristics more willing than others to deploy to spaces in post-conflict environments with higher-than average one-sided violence against civilians? Second, irrespective of where troops are deployed, are particular TCCs more effective in reducing one-sided civilian violence? We look at the attributes of troop contributing countries such as GDP, military expenditures, and combat experience to assess decision-making and effectiveness in responding to and treating violence in post-conflict countries. We build a geo-coded deployment database of peacekeeping units in Africa from 2005 to 2016 to answer the postulated questions.	Brandon Prins	NA
2019	84869	373	Under the Roof of Rebels: Civilian Targeting After Territorial Takeover in Sierra Leone	When are civil wars particularly dangerous for civilians? This letter shows that transition periods after rebels gain territorial control are remarkably violent for civilians. Previous research on civilian targeting in conflicts has focused on a dichotomy between contested territories and areas fully controlled by one combatant to explain levels of violence against civilians. We draw attention to the transition between those poles - when successful insurgents gain territory and turn into rebel rulers. We argue that rebels’ interaction with civilians during this transformation is particularly violent due to lacking resources and knowledge to govern peacefully. To test this dynamic argument, we draw on methodological advances in integrating event data and combine multiple event datasets to study patterns of violence in Sierra Leone from 1997-2001. We perform spatiotemporal inference that shows that civilian targeting increases in the period after rebels capture territory from the government compared to areas without territorial takeover.

2019	84026	257	A New Data Set on Territorial Self-Governance with an Application to Self-Determination Conflicts	Past research on the autonomy-conflict link has primarily used aggregated information on territorial self-governance and has largely ignored that autonomy is not implemented uniformly within countries. Without an explicit focus on the different levels of autonomy, little can actually be said about the impact of territorial self-governance arrangements. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the Territorial Self-Governance data set (TSG), which offers unique and innovative data on self- and shared-rule indicators of autonomy regimes in 47 countries with 169 regions over the period 1950-2016 across the world. With this data, it is now possible to move beyond the analysis of mere aggregated information on territorial self-governance and investigate instead the specific institutional design of such arrangements and their impact on the risk of violent civil conflict. A first analysis reveals that the effect of territorial self-governance regimes on civil conflict is indeed sensitive to the level of autonomy. This main finding emphasizes the necessity for in-depth analyses of different levels of autonomy and interaction effects between different self- and shared-rule indicators for conflict prevention.

2019	86602	1160	Flag it up: The Counter-Effect of Secessionist Nationalism	What impact do secessionist campaigns by outgroups have on the ingroup's identity? Evidence from social psychology suggests that evidencing an outgroup's difference in opinion towards the ingroup makes ingroup members hold closer to the opinion of the ingroup. Following this literature, we argue that nationalist secessionism can have a backlash effect, increasing nationalist feelings among individuals who are not part of the secessionist movement. We test this claim by looking at the case of the Catalan independence movement. We measure nationalism with the density of flags displayed in the facade of buildings in Madrid. We employ a difference-in-differences design, comparing the density of flags before and after October 2017 between Madrid (treatment group) and Athens (control group). An experiment, to be fielded in Spring 2019, will help to disentangle two mechanisms for the effects: polarization and norm change. According to the first, the referendum shifted Spaniards towards more nationalist sentiments. According to the second, Catalan nationalism increased the salience of Spanish nationalism, altering established norms about the link between the use of the flag and the Francoist past.

2019	86262	886	The causes of irredentist claims	Irredentism is a serious challenge for political stability, as demonstrated by Russia's annexation of Crimea. Irredentists demand that territory and people are detached from one country to be united with another. While previous research has shown that arbitrary or precedent borders, loss of autonomy and political marginalization trigger irredentist war, we know less about the causes of irredentist claims, regardless of whether or not they escalate to violence. Furthermore, scholars investigated why minorities demand increased self-rule, yet our understanding of what drives governments to make demands on behalf of their foreign kin remains limited. We suggest that transnational ethnic groups that experienced border changes causing their division are most likely to demand renewed unification. Past unity fosters a common identity. Also, irredentist leaders can instrumentalize myths of former statehood. After territorial changes, the stranded minority seeks to reunify with its homeland owing to a threat to its cultural identity in the new state, while the homeland regime supports the cut-off minority owing to affective or strategic motivations. The global analysis covering minority and majority ethnic groups, 1946-2017, supports our theory.	Seraina Ruegger	NA
2019	86256	881	Dangerous precedents? Border change, spillover and new territorial disputes.	A common concern in International Relations is that territorial changes in one region may destabilise borders elsewhere, by setting precedents that encourage further actors to challenge the status quo. Despite the importance of this claim, it has not yet been tested empirically. This paper thus examines how border changes affect the risk of new interstate territorial disputes elsewhere. While international rules generally impose strong constraints on territorial revisionism, the enforcement of these rules can vary across time and space, and is in many cases uncertain. Would-be revisionist states base their choice to initiate a dispute in part on the observed behaviour of other, proximate states. Successful border changes nearby demonstrate the weakness of international constraints, suggesting favourable conditions for revisionism. Therefore, regional border instability increases the risk of dispute initiation. Using new data on border changes since 1886 and data on interstate territorial disputes, I find that previous regional border changes are indeed associated with the initiation of new disputes by third states. Moreover, this effect is largely driven by conflictual instances of border change that violate territorial integrity norms.	Guy Schvitz	NA
2019	75917	31	Pacifying or Provoking: The Role of Access to Financial Institutions in Violent Conflicts	Although scholars have previously studied the effect of political institutions on conflict, the influence of economic and financial institutions on violent conflict has not been explored in any detail. Currently, the literature assumes that access to domestic financial services is spatially and temporally constant and thus inconsequential to conflict processes. In this paper, we relax this assumption by developing a theoretical framework that links the differential access to financial institutions to the likelihood of violent conflict. By providing financial risk management services, financial institutions can reduce economic grievances and thus the risk of conflict. On the other hand, access to financial institutions can also increase the risk of conflict since they may represent a “honeypot” for opportunists and facilitate rebel funding. We argue that the ability of a state in protecting and monitoring financial institutions can strengthen the former effect and mitigate the latter one. We evaluate our hypotheses using georeferenced data across different datasets at different aggregation levels. Our results show that the pacifying and provocative effects of financial institutions on conflict are conditional the local capacity of governments.	Babak RezaeeDaryakenari	NA
2019	84701	352	Central Banks and Civil War Termination	The ability to finance conflict likely affects the odds of sustaining a war and succeeding in it. Recent literature explores rebel group funding, but less is known about how states finance their civil war efforts. During international wars, countries with central banks borrow capital at lower costs. However, it is not clear how monetary institutions influence civil war dynamics. Civil wars alter both the domestic incentives to use monetary policy, and monetary institutions’ international credibility in ways that may differ from international wars. This paper studies how central bank independence (CBI) affects the government’s ability to finance civil conflict, and thus, civil war termination. Statistical analyses on a sample of civil conflicts between 1970 and 2009 show that CBI is associated with higher likelihood of conflict termination. When the form of termination is disaggregated, (higher) CBI is associated with a higher probability of government victory, and with a lower probability of rebel victory. Regarding mechanisms, the evidence suggests that CBI is associated with better conditions in credit markets, and with lower inflation in countries experiencing civil wars.	Ana Carolina Garriga	NA
2019	86117	779	The Impact of War and Security on Financial Development	Domestic political competition constrains politicians’ ability to fund wars and mobilize to deter external and internal adversaries. Thus, governments have an incentive to extract revenue in ways in which they receive no blame or are generally unnoticed by the public. Historically, governments have been able to extract revenue through regulation of the banking industry. While this can be crucial for raising revenue, these market distortions can hinder a state’s long-run economic development. This paper uses data on domestic banking activity to examine how security threats result in the funneling of private deposits to government coffers via rent seeking. I find that several measures of external threat and internal strife are associated with greater allocation towards the domestic sector and, also, broader measures of financial development. The paper suggests that historical patterns persist in modern economies. More importantly, the findings have implications for how we understand the relationship between security and economic development but also the manner in which states to fund security both at home and abroad.

2019	86160	811	Globalisation and conflicts: the good, the bad, and the ugly of corporations in Africa	Using georeferenced data on the affiliates and headquarters of multinational enterprises together with georeferenced conflict data, this work is the first to establish a causal link between the activities of multinational enterprises and violence. The results indicate that activities which increase local human capital decrease the probability of civil conflict, while the activity of exploitative sectors, in particular agriculture and forestry, increases conflict. The increase in the likelihood of conflict is amplified in areas with politically unrepresented ethnic groups, and/or groups targeted for large-scale land acquisition.	Tommaso Sonno	NA
2019	84646	337	The road to Discord: Social Conflict, Oil and Local Institutions	Why do some oil-rich regions in developing countries experience social conflict and others do not? The literature asserts that hydrocarbon production may trigger local grievances that are voiced particularly if governments can substitute tax revenues with oil-earnings. This shift may deteriorate institutions, as politicians lose incentives to be accountable vis-à-vis aggravated populations. Despite its prevalence the micro-foundations of this channel are underspecified, because individuals’ inclination to pursue lower levels of political conflict remain to be examined in the relevant contexts. We leverage novel field-level data on oil-ownership throughout 21 countries Sub-Sahara Africa and a geologic instrumental variable predicting a field’s economic viability to account for local effects of exogenous changes in governmental revenue. Combining this information with details from three Afrobarometer survey rounds, our analysis reveals a pivotal role of local institutions in the form of communal councils: respondents living in areas hosting oilfields with increased public shares are more likely to protest and endorse political violence – if they express dissatisfaction with the councils. This negative effect is reversed once institutions are perceived to be responsive towards citizens’ needs.	Mario Krauser	NA
2019	75866	29	Principled Pragmatism and the ‘Inclusion Project’: Implementing a Gender Perspective in Peace Agreements	UNSCR 1325 provided that peace agreements should adopt a ‘gender perspective’. This commitment has been reiterated in women, peace and security resolutions since that time. This article uses a mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis to consider when and how peace agreements have adopted a gender perspective, using a new PA-X peace agreement database to analyse over 1500 peace and transition agreements from between 1990 and 2016. The article provides new data on the implementation of agreement commitments and specifically those issues singled out for attention by UNSCR 1325. Analysis of the dataset provides three main findings. First provision for women is still largely limited to once-off provisions, or issues relating to the victimhood of women, with holistic attempts to adopt a ‘gender perspective’ relatively rare. Secondly, the inclusion of women in peace agreement texts tends to be located in the more comprehensive stages of the agreement. Thirdly, political power-sharing is shown to be strongly correlated with several measures of gender inclusion rather than marking a focus on the inclusion of the groups at the heart of the conflict.

2019	86131	788	Identity concessions in peace agreements	Creating a stable peace is now the key puzzle to resolve in ending civil wars. At the same time, civil wars are increasingly fought over identity - the activation of group demands is an effective lever for mobilizing violence. It would therefore seem intuitive that including identity concessions, such as language rights, cultural rights or the right to religion, in a peace agreement would contribute to a stable peace, yet we know little about whether this is the case. This article examines a database of peace agreements from conflicts with ethnic aims from 1990 to 2015 and examines when identity rights are included in a peace agreement and under what conditions the satisfaction of identity demands can impact on peace stability. Taking into account selection effects, the preliminary results show that the granting and implementation of such rights increases peace stability, with an effect that is independent of that of the political settlement. The paper thus contributes to research on the role of grievances in civil wars and the use of violence and the findings have important policy implications.	Lesley-Ann Daniels	NA
2019	86239	870	What can we learn from peace agreement texts? Presenting the PA-X Corpus	The Peace Agreement Database and Dataset provides a full record of formally negotiated and signed peace agreement documents, for the 1990-2015 period (www.peaceagreements.org). In addition to its potential for use as a qualitative and quantitative data resource, it will soon be available as a corpus of texts suitable for computer-based text analysis. The PA-X Corpus is currently under development (expected completion in February 2019) and consists of ~1800 documents across multiple stages of negotiations, from pre-negotiations, when the warring sides are talking about how to approach the peace process, to ceasefires and comprehensive agreements. The data encompass agreements relating to both interstate and intrastate conflict. In this paper, I provide an overview of the data resource and demonstrate the potential for its use in various strands of political science research. In particular, I examine the differences in language found across the texts from peace processes with varying levels of third-party involvement, attempting to ascertain whether the third-party preferences correlate with the most pronounced topics in peace process negotiations.

2019	86249	877	Peace agreement effectiveness and quality of post-war elections	Peace agreements often prescribe the holding of elections, as more than 20% of all peace agreement documents include at least some mention of elections. Relying on peace agreements data collected in the Peace Agreements Database and Access Tool (PA-X), I test the connection between existence of peace agreements tackling elections and orderliness of post-war elections. I argue that peace agreement documents are not just dead letters: they at the very least indicate that the warring sides are not opposed to being associated with some agreed point, and in the best-case scenario they may even indicate the willingness to commit to a particular course of action.The experience of repeated mentions of elections in peace agreements will create greater expectations for the elections when they are held, and greater costs of holding poor-quality elections for all parties involved. I find that the increasing number of peace agreements mentioning elections does correlate with higher quality of elections that are actually held, and higher probability of protest when the promise of free and fair elections is not upheld.

2019	86441	1023	Exploring Duration of Peace Using Text Analysis	We present the first in-depth study of peace agreements using quantitative text analysis performed on 649 agreements negotiated between 1947-2017. We apply topic models to the corpus of peace agreements and discover abstract topics that correspond to dominant issues discussed in each agreement. We analyze the relationship between the issues negotiated in the agreement and the likelihood of the agreement’s successful implementation. Across different peace agreements we also explore how the salience of negotiated issues changes over time. Having examined peace agreements with regards to actors and their objectives, enforcement, and mediation, our preliminary findings suggest that peace agreements covering a broader range of topics tend indeed to last longer; secessionist conflicts end in a more stable peace; mediators do not prolong the longevity of peace agreements, and the promise of external enforcement has no effect on the duration of peace.

2019	86196	840	Power in the Post-Conflict Period: The Effect of Armed Conflict on Women’s Political Leadership Positions	While research has shown that civil wars often significantly increase women’s descriptive representation in legislatures, we know little about their long-term effect on women holding political leadership positions. Since conflict disrupts existing social structures, women often take over high-level economic and political positions during the civil war. What is not known, however, is whether women are able to hold on to these leadership positions after the end of conflict and whether a civil war thus leads to a lasting change in the power dynamic. Utilizing a unique data set of female political leaders in post-civil war countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we empirically examine whether the existence and severity of a conflict leads to increases in the number of women in political leadership positions in the post-civil war period and their ability to retain long-term power. Our findings indicate that post-civil war situations promote an increased number of female political leaders. This research has implications both for the understanding of post-civil war situations and for the conditions under which women attain broad political power.	Britt Bolin	NA
2019	84427	310	The Elasticity of Identity in Rwanda and Burundi	Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi have long been conceived of as distinct ethnic groups based on differences in origin, occupation and appearance. The ostensible rigidity and salience of identity has been repeatedly demonstrated throughout the many episodes of violence, with emphasis placed on ethnicity. Yet, the boundaries between these groups have not always been as rigid as suggested. Scholars have highlighted numerous instances of intermixing, as different ethnicities lived alongside each other and intermarried. Yet, more notable instances of Hutu and Tutsi switching ethnicities have largely been ignored. In this paper, we assess the degree of identity elasticity—fluidity driven by demand, supply and cost—in Rwanda and Burundi in an effort to counter the notion that identities were immutable and explore the implications of fluidity/rigidity for violence. We adapt Akerlof’s (2000) analysis, which specifies a utility function of identity as a motivation for behaviour, to demonstrate why certain historical moments were characterised by greater or lesser fluidity, and that rigid ethnic boundaries are not evidenced at the outset of episodes of inter-ethnic violence.

2019	85238	426	The Political Consequences of Wartime Sexual Violence: Evidence from a List Experiment	Although sexual violence is a widespread phenomenon in war, empirical evidence concerning its political impact is limited. The main problem in the study of the consequences of wartime sexual violence is under-reporting due to feelings of shame, guilt or fear. We overcome this limitation by presenting the results of a list experiment embedded in a representative survey in Sri Lanka, which is recovering from an ethnic civil war between Singhalese and Tamils. Importantly, we connect this indirect measure of experiencing sexual violence during war to individual post-conflict political participation. We find that experiences of sexual violence have a strong mobilizing effect among survivors. In terms of causal mechanisms, we rule out selection arguments and the notion of post-traumatic growth. Instead, increased political activism seems to be a rational response to cope with the experience of sexual violence during war. Our finding has important implications for policy and the political prospects of post-conflict societies.	Richard Traunmueller	NA
2019	81549	135	Lip Service or Lasting Protection: The Effect of Transitional Justice Mechanisms on Minority Rights	Ethnic minority scapegoating is an enduring political tactic that sometimes spirals beyond racist rhetoric and into egregious, government-sanctioned human rights abuses. In the wake of such events, governments may attempt to address these past crimes by employing elements of transitional justice, such as trials, truth and reconciliation commissions, reparations, lustration and vetting procedures, exiles, and/or amnesties. Because these mechanisms are designed to increase respect for human rights and the rule of law, it is widely assumed that states that implement them will do a better job of protecting minority rights than states that fail to implement them. The literature has yet to evaluate this belief, however, and so our paper puts this unexamined assumption to the test by analyzing quantitative data on transitional justice mechanisms and minority rights in Europe and Latin America between 1970 and 2007. By showing how the use of transitional justice is linked to subsequent respect for minority rights, we offer the first quantitative assessment of how well transitional justice performs in accomplishing one of its main goals: safeguarding the rights of vulnerable populations.

2019	84411	306	Modeling the Subnational Risk of Acute Malnutrition in Conflict-Affected Settings	Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen are currently facing famine conditions - the first recorded instance of four countries experiencing such declared crises simultaneously. All these countries have been prone to violent conflict and remain susceptible to climate shocks, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine. The gravity of these situations serves as inspiration for devising effective means to better anticipate crises and guide appropriate responses. This paper presents initial results of empirical analyses focusing on the cases of Karamoja, Uganda and West Pokot, Kenya. An evidence-driven computational model is used to assess the reliability of leading indicators in predicting trajectories of susceptibility to acute malnutrition of children at different levels of spatial and temporal granularity. Household and expert surveys administered in both contexts shape the design of the model, which is then seeded and calibrated with data on individuals, households and their environment, as well as validated with out-of-sample tests. A final step uses the model to explore counterfactual scenarios of different interventions, including allocations of humanitarian and development assistance.	Karsten Donnay	NA
2019	86054	729	Environmental migration, urbanization, and conflict	The impact of climate change on migration and, subsequently, conflict is likely to be one of the most serious challenges societies will face in the future. Environmental events could force millions of people to leave their homes. This mass movement of individuals could strain resources and affect communal cohesion in receiving areas, which may lead to insecurity and conflict. Yet, we have limited understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying these processes as well as empirical evidence. We examine the relationship between environmental change, migration to urban areas, and conflict. We contend that conflict is more likely to occur when migration is triggered by long-term (droughts) than short-term environmental events (floods). Migrants having experienced long- term environmental events are more likely to suffer from grievances that induce conflict perceptions and urbanites perceive these migrants as competitors for public services and jobs. We empirically analyze this argument with newly collected micro-level data comprising more than 3,500 migrants and urbanites from three cities in Vietnam. The results support our proposition and emphasize that local socio-economic/institutional conditions matter for the emergence of conflict.	Vally Koubi	NA
2019	86501	1073	Crops, Shocks, and Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa: Beyond Opportunity-Based Explanations of Local Political Violence	What explains local-level conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa? Recent research uses climate and price variation to identify effects of economic shocks on conflict. Beyond opportunity cost and rapacity mechanisms, the causal channels and scope conditions remain elusive. In this paper, I show that agriculture-related conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa is about more than income fluctuations or economic vulnerability to weather shocks. Instead, local conflict is most likely where a historically inherited mix of communal governance and ethnic diversity fuels ethnic competition between “sons of the soil” and in-migrating “ethnic strangers”. Such conditions tend to prevail in areas that have produced export crops from the colonial age onward. I use fine-grained geospatial data on historical resource production, conflict events, weather shocks, world market prices, and local-level ethnic demography to test my argument. Preliminary findings suggest that economic downturns have stronger conflict-inducing effects in more “modern” cash crop regions than in other areas that depend on agriculture. These effects are driven by ethnically heterogeneous cash crop zones, indicating that agricultural conflict in Africa has an identity component that remains underappreciated in the quantitative literature.

2019	86621	1174	The dark side of renewable energy in Kenya and Ethiopia: a sub-national analysis exploring the climate variability, hydropower and pastoral violence nexus	Kenya and Ethiopia are undergoing an energy transformation from fossil-fuels to renewable energy. While this expansion can provide many benefits, such growth is not without risks. Hydroelectric dams alter ecosystems, decreases water spots and available grazing land to feed livestock. Pastoral communities are among the first casualties of hydroelectric dams due to their strong dependence on changing ecosystems for their livelihoods. Moreover, previous research suggest that temperature and precipitation variability increase tensions between pastoral groups. We argue that pastoral communities in the region may experience a “double whammy” from hydroelectric dams and a changing climate by increasing the risk of violent events. We employ a multilevel model across local Ethiopian and Kenyan administrative units from 1990 to 2013. While we find that the frequency of pastoral violence decreases in level-2 administrative units with a hydroelectric dam, we also find some evidence of a double whammy effect. We find some evidence that the effect of warmer than average years on the risk of pastoral conflict is amplified in level-2 administrative units with a hydroelectric dam.	Alfonso Sanchez	NA
2019	84460	318	How Migration Policies Moderate the Diffusion of Terrorism	There is an ongoing debate among practitioners and scholars about the security consequences of transnational migration. Yet, existing work has not yet fully taken into account the policy instruments states have at their disposal to mitigate these, and we lack reliable evidence for the effectiveness of such measures. The following research addresses both shortcomings as we analyze whether and to what extent national migration policies affect the diffusion of terrorism via population movements. Spatial analyses report robust support for a moderating influence of states’ policies: while terrorism can travel from one country to another via larger migration populations, this only applies to target countries with extremely open controls and lax regulations. This research sheds new light on the security implications of population movements, and it crucially adds to our understanding of governments’ instruments for addressing migration challenges as well as their effectiveness.

2019	84508	325	Refugees and terrorism: the conditioning effect of migration policies	Fear of terrorism driven by immigration has radically polarized government agendas in advanced countries. Claims for harder border controls and travel bans have become a divisive political issue. Strikingly, however, evidence on the impact of refugee inflows and border control on terrorist violence is scarce. In this paper we examine the impact of refugee inflows and policy on two different forms of terrorism: against host populations and refugees themselves. We rely on two empirical strategies. First, we draw on a novel and extensive time series cross-sectional dataset covering 35 OECD countries over 15 years, including refugee policies and the incidence of various types of terrorism. Second, we conduct a difference in differences analysis assessing the impact of Germany’s sudden and salient pro-refugee policy approach in 2015. Our preliminary analyses suggest that refugee inflows and restrictive border controls have insignificant effects on attacks against host populations by transnational terrorist groups. However, permissive refugee policies increase attacks against refugee populations. We explore the economic, cultural and political threat mechanisms behind our findings with a georeferenced dataset of anti-refugee violence in Germany.	Sergi Pardos-Prado	NA
2019	85173	410	Transnational Terrorism and Restrictive Immigration Policies	We study the effect of transnational terrorism risk perception on immigration policy change for a sample of 30 OECD countries between 1981 and 2010. We argue that to avoid electoral defeat governments may implement more restrictive migration policies during times of high terrorism risk to signal political resolve to an electorate that dislikes the fear and economic instability that are associated with terrorism. We find that an increased perception of transnational terrorism risk leads to stricter migration controls but does not affect general migration policy. We show that this finding holds for different operationalization of terrorism risk and when endogeneity is accounted for. Furthermore, we provide some evidence that the nexus between terrorism risk perception and immigration policy changed after the end of the Cold War, potentially as transnational terrorism by Islamist groups (which tends to be more bloody and directed at civilian targets) became more prominent.

2019	85298	442	Racist Substitution? Impact of Jihadist attacks on the perception of discrimination among Muslims	A growing strand of the literature analyzes the causal impact of terrorism on discriminatory attitudes. But how does it feel to be Muslim in the aftermath of terror events? This question is largely unanswered, possibly because minorities in society are minorities in data-sets. Exploiting exogenous variation in terror threat, we compare the perceived discrimination on relevant dimensions (race, religion) against placebo dimensions (gender, sexuality) of the relevant minority (Muslims) against placebo minorities (non-Muslims out-group) before and after six different terror attacks in six different countries studied as “natural experiments”. The most important result is that terrorism causes a “substitution effect” in perceived race-relations. Jihadist attacks increase perceived racial discrimination among Muslims, who generally perceive lower racial discrimination, and decrease perceived racial discrimination among non-Muslims, who generally perceive higher racial discrimination. This effect takes place for racial discrimination only, and not for religious, nationality or language based discrimination. Jihadist terrorism seems to increase the alignment of non-Muslim minorities with the in-group: not only they report lower perceived discrimination, but also, unlike Muslims, they significantly increase their own anti-immigration attitudes.

2019	82001	148	Electoral Incentives and Violence against Refugees	Research on the security consequences of forced migration tends to focus on how refugee flows contribute to the diffusion of violence across borders. However, new evidence shows that there is more violence perpetrated against refugees than violence perpetrated by refugees against host states. This paper identifies when host states are more likely to violate the physical integrity of their refugee populations. We argue that violence against refugees tends to increase during election periods, as leaders act on incentives to foster xenophobia and construct more exclusive notions of group identity to boost their own prospects at the polls. In addition, refugees without electoral power are strategically attractive targets of violence for leaders who aim to deflect criticism and maintain power. We provide a multi-pronged approach to test our conjecture, supplementing a large-N cross-sectional analysis using new data on violence against refugees with sub-national geo-spatial analysis of elections and violence in sub-Saharan Africa during the period 2000 to 2010. The findings provide evidence for our expectations and have implications for the international community’s current delegation of refugee protection to host governments.	Burcu Savun	NA
2019	83132	206	Parochialism, Social Norms, and Discrimination Against Immigrants	Ingroup bias and outgroup prejudice are pervasive features of human behavior, motivating various forms of discrimination and conflict. In an era of increased cross-border migration, these tendencies exacerbate inter-group conflict between host populations and immigrant groups, raising the question of how conflict can be overcome. We address this question through a large-scale field intervention conducted in 31 cities across three German states, designed to measure assistance provided to immigrants during everyday social interactions. This randomized trial found that cultural integration signaled through shared social norms mitigates--but does not eliminate--bias against outgroups driven by perceptions of ethno-religious differences. Our results suggest that eliminating or suppressing ascriptive differences is not a necessary path to conflict reduction in multicultural societies; rather, achieving a shared understanding of civic behavior can form the basis of cooperation.

2019	84631	334	Natural Hazards, Migratory Flows and Conflict Risk	Does migration following from natural hazards increase the likelihood of conflict? If so, to what extent can institutions alleviate such negative consequences? Existing studies have found support for the link between conflict-induced migration and armed conflict. However, migratory responses related to slow- or rapid-onset natural hazards and possible mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects are less well understood. Using geo-referenced data on people displaced by natural hazards and various types of conflict in Southeast Asia, this paper employs statistical network analysis to explore the role of institutions in the relationship between migration and conflict. Network analysis allows for modelling interdependencies between areas of migratory origin and destination, therefore more accurately depicting the complexity of decisions to migrate. The paper aim to further the discussion on hazard-induced migration and conflict by examining the impact of political institutions and public policies in areas of origin and destination.

2019	85310	448	Violence, Generosity and Politics: Evidence from IDP Hosting during the Syrian Crisis	How do experiences of war, violence and displacement affect altruism toward members of different ethnic or religious groups? Theories of empathy-driven altruism suggest that violence can increase people’s ability to empathize and that experiences of violence can create identities the bridge political divides. We test this theory in the context of the Syria civil war with data from over 1500 Syrians living in North and South Syria in 2017. We find that Syrians who experiences more violence and displacement during the conflict discriminate less against members of other sects and are more open to helping vulnerable IDPs. However, preferences for helping others are still shaped by sectarian identity and the political dynamics unfolding during conflict. Our findings show that violence does not necessarily lead to greater antagonism toward outgroups, as is often assumed, but that politics shapes generosity during war.	Alexandra Hartman	NA
2019	86133	790	LOOK WHO PERPETRATES VIOLENCE: Explaining The Variation in Forced Migration	Previous scholarship on the causes of forced migration has adopted a uniform approach and has not differentiated refugee and internally displaced people (IDPs) flows. In other words, existing research has assumed that the main determinants of internal and external displacement are the same. In this paper, I challenge the general understanding and argue that refugee and IDPs flows have distinct causes in civil conflicts. Civilians might be subject to direct violence as warring parties need to fund their activities and to put pressure on and cut the support for the rival. Depending on the perpetrator, government or rebels, the effect of violence on displacement varies. If rebels perpetuate violence, the number of IDPs increases because by fleeing conflict zone within the country, people can escape from rebel violence. However, if the perpetrator is government, we see an increase in the number of refugees, because to escape from government violence, people may have to leave their country. A regression analysis of civil conflicts between 1989 and 2016 and out-of-sample cross-validation corroborate my expectations.	Oguzhan Turkoglu	NA
2019	86186	833	REBEL TERRITORY CONTROL AND FORCED MIGRATION	Existing studies on the causes of forced migration have studied governments as the only culprit and ignored how rebel groups may play a significant role in displacement. In this paper, I argue that civil conflicts in which rebels hold territorial control generate more displaced people than others. Under rebel control, civilians experience more social and economic pressure in addition to violence. For their activities, rebels collect heavy taxes and resort to extortion as well as forced recruitment. They may also limit the foreign aid to the conflict zone. In addition, rebels may prohibit social activities (e.g., cinema and internet) and introduce new rules (e.g., making hijab compulsory and banning shaving beards). In other words, civilians face more problems in territories under rebel control. To test my argument, I analyze civil conflicts between 1989 and 2011 (because of data availability). Both in-sample regression analysis and out-of-sample cross-validation corroborate my expectation. To elaborate the causal claim further, I employ the conflict between the Yemen government and Houthis as a quantitative case study. Both synthetic control and differences-in-differences analyses support my argument.	Oguzhan Turkoglu	NA
2019	76380	41	Introducing the Armed Nonstate Actor Rivalry Dataset (ANARD)	While research on interstate rivalries is abundant, scholarship examining the dynamics of nonstate actor rivalry remains limited. Rivalry scholars have produced extensive data on militarised disputes between states: by contrast, data and theory regarding militarised interactions between armed nonstate actors is relatively scarce. This is surprising given that much violent interaction in the contemporary international system unfolds between armed nonstate actors rather than states. Due to data and theory limitations we have only partial knowledge of the factors that precipitate violence escalation among armed nonstate actors. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the Armed Nonstate Actor Rivalry Dataset (ANARD) – which captures dyadic rivalries and instances of militarised interaction between armed nonstate actors (Militarised-Nonstate-Disputes (MNSDS)) in the Middle East and North Africa between 1990-2018. We begin by explaining why data on militarised interactions between armed nonstate organisations is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of conflict escalation, before providing details of the data collection process and coding practices, paying particular attention to our novel three-category measure of violence severity, which utilises offensive action thresholds to capture observed levels of conflict.

2019	86037	717	How Individual Actors Can Derail Group Conflicts	Do individual actors have the power to derail conflict dynamics, and influence patterns of violence? Studies of ethnic conflicts and repression consider violence as an intergroup dynamic, entailing ongoing interactions between diverse actors including incumbent states, rebel groups, protesters and oppressed minorities. Shifts in patterns of violence, are often considered to be driven by strategic, practical or ideological motivations. However, at times independent actors, commit uncoordinated and unexpected attacks which fundamentally influence dynamics of conflict. Analyzing geo-located police data from Jerusalem, and exploiting what was an unexpected, and perhaps exogenous shock to intergroup relations in the city, we demonstrate how individual actors can radically shift conflict dynamics. Doing so, we show how the kidnapping and vicious murder in July 2014 of Mohamad Abu Hdeir, a young Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, influenced the prevalence, location and types of violence implemented by residents of one of the most contested cities in the world. Our evidence calls for a new understanding of conflict dynamics, paying attention not only to organized groups , but also to individual entrepreneurs which can change conflict trajectories independently.

2019	86326	933	Explaining the variation in sub-national diffusion of civil conflict: civilians' targeting and reactive violence.	Why do some conflicts diffuse and others do not? Previous research has mainly focused on transnational diffusion and few studies have analysed its sub-national dimension. While scholars have studied the role of country-level covariates, conflict processes has been largely overlooked. Yet, as shown by the literature on the micro-foundations of civil war, the latter are pivotal determinants that shape the unfolding of conflict. Types of violence, nature of the actors and tactical considerations influence subsequent instances of sub-national conflict. I show that reactive violence is linked to the spatial variation of conflict and to horizontal escalations in proximate areas. Accordingly, I bridge the theories of deterrence and alienation to population-centric warfare deriving testable implications on “quality” and “quantity” of violence. Firstly, I propose that diffusion is amplified by violence against civilians in adjacent spatial units through reactive violence. Secondly, I propose a link between deterrence and alienation-based explanations relying on the number of civilian fatalities. I test these hypotheses conducting a dis-aggregated analysis on a sample of spatial-cell/month observations covering the African continent from 1997 to 2014.	Andrea Salvi	NA
2019	86556	1122	Government Responses to Militant Group Competition	How do governments respond to intergroup competition among militant organizations? Previous studies have demonstrated that governments may increase violations of physical integrity rights in response to terrorist and rebel violence committed by groups. This paper argues that increasing competition between groups signals an acute threat to the government's authority, especially when this competitive behavior is public. Observable competition between groups indicates a higher level of commitment than when such groups operate independent of one another. As a result, the government is more likely to increase its violation of physical integrity rights. Using original data on intergroup rivalries in African countries, we find that governments are likely to engage in higher levels of physical integrity rights violations and torture in response to increasing competition - and especially, competitive violence - between militant groups.

2019	86587	1149	The Diffusion of Anti-Government Protests in Time and Space	How do anti-government protests diffuse in autocracies? As disaggregated data is sparse, we know little about the exact spatio-temporal pattern of mass protests and underlying diffusion channels. Recent accounts speculate that relational channels, like social networks, are more important for protest diffusion in autocracies than non-relational channels, like foreign media. I advance this debate by providing a discriminate perspective on information effects. While information in relational channels is qualitatively better and more trustworthy, information by non-relational channels reaches a larger share of the society. Additionally, informational value may differ for citizens depending on the municipality size of their home town. The results lower exceptions about the importance of relational channels for protest diffusion. Using new geo-referenced data on the day-municipality level on protests in East Germany in 1989, I find no overall effect of spatially close protests on subsequent protest propensity, which questions a strong effect of local networks. However, I find evidence for spatial protest contagion among smaller municipalities. Moreover, large centres exhibit a pull effect as protest in larger cities decrease protest propensity in spatially proximate smaller municipalities.	Katrin Paula	NA
2019	84732	358	The Myth of the Misinformed Irregular Migrant? Insights from Nigeria	The past decade has seen large numbers of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempt to reach Europe irregularly along the dangerous 'Mediterranean route,' a trend that is projected to increase in coming decades (Hanson and McIntosh 2016). In response, European governments have invested heavily in initiatives to deter irregular migration, including an explosive expansion of information campaigns designed to inform potential migrants about the dangers of the journey and the unwelcoming reception they might receive in Europe (Schans and Optekamp 2016). There is surprisingly little evidence about whether such campaigns accomplish their stated objectives, and whether potential migrants actually are misinformed about the costs of the journey and the benefits of Europe. We provide such evidence from a representative survey we conducted in Benin City, the epicenter of irregular migration out of Nigeria, which is itself the largest sub-Saharan African source of irregular migrants to Europe. We find that potential migrants in this context are better informed about destination contexts than European information campaigns assume, but are poorly informed about the journey itself, and we discuss correlates of migration-related knowledge.

2019	85277	435	Does information about policy attribution influence candidate selection? Evidence from a survey experiment in Ghana.	Building on recent work concerning the impact of attribution on accountability, we investigate whether information about policy attribution influences candidate selection. Selection is a key component of electoral accountability, and is incorporated in some way in all recent accountability models (Ashworth 2012). Campaign promises provide information about potential future performance that can affect expectations about what policies will be chosen, and provide a benchmark for future performance evaluation (Aragones et al. 2010). It is reasonable therefore to think that voters will be more likely to condition selection on promises concerning attributable policy outcomes, for which effort in office can be evaluated more effectively. Using a survey experiment in Accra, Ghana, we randomize the provision of systemic information concerning responsibility for education outcomes, in order to evaluate its impact on citizens' concern for education policy. We use conjoint analysis to measure the extent to which education promises influence the selection of candidates in District Assembly elections.	Robin Harding	NA
2019	85396	478	Citizen Preferences and Disparities in Elite Responsiveness: Evidence from Deliberative Forums in Kampala, Uganda	How responsive are political elites to citizens? When preferences of political elites diverge from those of citizens, which set of preferences drives a final decision? Questions relating to disparities in elite responsiveness have recently constituted a fruitful avenue of investigation (Einstein and Glick 2017; Meng et al. 2017; Öhberg and Naurin 2015; Truex 2016). We answer these questions by leveraging a set of 140 consultative sessions between 1,050 citizens and local political elites in Kampala, Uganda, as an arena of preference divergence (Humphreys et al. 2006). To overcome self-selection biases, we randomize both citizens’ and elites’ participation to specific meetings, and incentivize citizen attendance (Sheely 2015) to reduce socio-economic biases in groups. With information about citizens’ and elites’ preferences collected via pre- and post-meeting surveys we are able to assess differential responsiveness. Finally, with a series of voting rounds inside the meeting, we are able to assess which preferences are dominant over the final decision. Our conclusions have the potential to highlight biases in consultative processes that are in widespread use at the local level in developing countries.	Constantin Manuel Bosancianu	NA
2019	85952	675	Norms and Women’s Political Participation: Survey Evidence from Rural Ghana	Gender gaps in participation and representation are common in new democracies, both at the elite level and at the grassroots. We investigate the content and structure of gendered social norms around political participation at the grassroots level in rural Ghana using a three-wave panel survey conducted as part of a randomized field experiment that encouraged the political participation of women at the local level. In the first two waves, we find significant variation in both norms and intra-household correlation in attitudes across communities. Local party leaders also appear to be sensitive to this variation in their messaging to the communities. We will report results from all three waves of the survey and discuss the extent to which they explain the durability or malleability of gender norms in a rapidly developing content.	Nahomi Ichino	NA
2019	86241	872	How does Violence Change Local Ethnic Demography?: Evidence from Kenya	Existing research suggests people seek ethnically homogeneous areas when conflict occurs. However, less is known about the conditions under which conflict is most likely to change local ethnic demography. I argue that violence increases ethnic segregation where the costs of leaving an ethnically diverse locality are high. Because people are less willing to leave ethnically diverse localities endowed with resources or access to markets, violence is most likely to produce ethnic segregation in high-value localities. When ethnic groups are equally capable of remaining in a desirable locality, violence will be more likely to increase segregation. Using estimates of ethnic composition based on voter registers from before and after Kenya's 2007 post-election crisis, I demonstrate that segregation has increased where violence occurred. I also show that conflict produced the most segregation in high-value locations, particularly those where ethnic groups have more equal population shares.	Kimuli Kasara	NA
2019	75527	9	Legacies of Wartime Order: ‘Punishment Attacks’ and Social Control in Northern Ireland	A growing body of research explores how non-state actors create informal institutions to maintain social order during conflict, yet there is little systematic knowledge of the legacy and persistence of wartime orders in post-conflict societies. The remnants of informal wartime institutions form a key challenge for governments in post-conflict societies in their attempts to re-establish themselves as legitimate authorities. So-called ‘punishment attacks’ in Northern Ireland offer insights into the relationship between informal justice systems and state legitimacy in post-conflict societies. Despite the Good Friday Agreement’s success in maintaining peace, many communities in Northern Ireland remain afflicted by violence associated with dissident paramilitary groups. Efforts to reform the police continue to be challenged by groups that impose social control through violent attacks in their communities. The paper combines historical analysis, interviews with relevant stakeholders, systematic local-level data on in-group violence and other indicators of social control, as well as survey data on people’s perceptions of both informal and formal authorities to understand how and to what extent wartime orders continue to shape social control in fringes of post-war society.

2019	85487	499	How Wartime Institutions Shape Electoral Performance after Civil Conflicts	How do wartime institutions shape the electoral geography of war-to-democracy transitions? We only have a limited understanding of how rebel-to-party transformations vary geographically within the post-conflict political landscape and how this geographical variation affects the electoral performance and mobilization strategies of former rebel groups. We argue that the electoral performance of rebels-turned-parties is a function of their ability to transform wartime military networks and organizational capabilities into political campaign machines. This ability varies with the geographic extent of wartime institutions: In areas where rebels institutionalized strategic control during war, they can activate former combatant networks by distributing economic benefits, appeal to political identities generated during the war, and credibly promise political and security returns on their implementation of the peace deal. We test these proposition using the case of the Indonesian province of Aceh. First, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between strategic wartime control on electoral performance in several post-conflict election rounds. Second, we use propensity score matching to select areas with/without strong GAM presence for focus groups discussion that enable us to trace the different political mobilization strategies.

2019	86128	786	Can the design of power-sharing peace settlements secure citizen support in post-conflict states? Evidence from conjoint survey experiments in Northern Ireland and Cyprus.	Power sharing political peace settlements are often advocated as solutions to conflict as they can secure the support of different groups in deeply divided societies. However, negotiators can find it difficult to incorporate public opinion into the design of these settlements. This is because standard survey responses do not provide nuanced information about the preferences of citizens concerning the various compromises contained within potential agreements. To address this gap this paper turns to conjoint analysis as a method that will enable researchers to gain a better understanding of the trade-offs citizens will accept in the design of peace settlements. Drawing upon data collected through two conjoint survey experiments in Northern Ireland and Cyprus, this paper demonstrates how important power sharing institutions are relative to other dimensions of peace settlements and what types of power sharing arrangements can elicit majority and cross community support. In identifying possible zones of agreement between different groups of citizens in divided societies, the paper also has policy implications for the future design of such arrangements and our broader understanding of the legitimacy of post-conflict institutions.

2019	86139	795	The determinants of female participation in resistance campaigns: A cross-national study	In recent years, mass mobilization and nonviolent protests have led to significant changes in autocratic regimes, varying from the ousting of autocrats and the introduction of democratic institutions, to transformation into civil war. Meanwhile, cross-national studies on civil resistance have made important advances in understanding the varying outcomes of this type of uprising. However, no study has systematically studied women’s presence or absence in such campaigns. To advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the social composition of resistance campaigns, I provide the first cross-national study on female participation in resistance campaigns. I use a new dataset, The Anatomy of Resistance Campaigns, that maps the organizations that took part in episodes of maximalist resistance in Africa between 1990 and 2015. The data identifies female participation in organizations like political parties and trade unions, as well as the presence of women’s groups in the campaign. Comparing nonviolent and violent campaigns, the empirical analysis provides important answers to which factors on the macro- and meso level that matter for explaining variations in the participation of women in resistance campaigns.

2019	86154	805	Extremist Militant Groups and the Provision of Justice: Experimental Evidence from South Central Somalia	In Somalia, individuals seeking redress for perceived injustices have three primary options: they can take their case to the formal state court which offers a mix of secular and Islamic (Sharia) law, to courts run by Islamist militant group al-Shabaab that enforce a strict brand of Sharia law, or to dispute resolution bodies led by traditional clan and religious elders. Choosing to take one’s case to a certain forum constitutes a tacit endorsement of that regime’s legitimacy and claim to authority; choosing to do so under certain circumstances but not others provides important demand-side clues as to where regimes are pulling ahead or falling behind in the competition for rule. We ask and seek to answer an important question in this context of legal pluralism – which factors lead individuals to seek redress at one forum for justice over another? We will present results from an ongoing conjoint experiment with over 600 citizens from across 40 districts in South Central Somalia, which aims to evaluate how citizens choose between these three different and often contradictory forums.

2019	83925	249	Trade as a Foreign Policy Issue: A Bilateral Micro Perspective	In an international system where cooperation appears increasingly at risk, a central question is to what extent citizens constrain governments by supporting international liberal norms. We, therefore, examine how much the mass publics in the United States, Australia and Germany value reciprocity as a key cooperative principle in international trade. This analysis requires that we use a bilateral perspective that departs from the common approach to examine trade preferences unilaterally without consideration of the behaviour and characteristics of the trading partner. Our survey experiments show that reciprocity continues to play an important role, especially towards traditional allies. However, a significant share of unconditional, non-cooperative attitudes exists, especially towards potential political challengers like China. Variation in these responses are best explained by perceptions of the other country as political adversary as concerns for relative gains become eminent. Trade and foreign policy issues, thus, are particularly intertwined when facing a political adversary. To the extent that the growing anti-globalization sentiment in many countries is rooted in these international political considerations, the threat to trade cooperation is more fundamental than often assumed.

2019	85778	572	The Nexus between the World Trade Organization and Codex Alimentarius	International standards play an important role in the governance of global trade. In virtually all recent trade agreements, signatory countries refer to them to reduce regulatory heterogeneity and facilitate trade flows. But who actually develops these standards? In the area of food trade, standards are developed by Codex Alimentarius, a hybrid regulatory network of state and non-state actors founded in 1963. Until 1995, Codex standards were voluntary. In that year, the World Trade Organization endorsed Codex as the standard-setting organization in the area of food trade and requested its members to base their food-related measures on the standards developed by Codex. This form of legalization has hardened the previously soft-law nature of Codex standards and upgraded them to de facto binding rules for market access. The principal objective of this paper is to investigate whether and, if so, how this legalization has led to a politicization of standard-setting processes at Codex. Relying on network analysis, a newly created dataset on the participation of state and non-state actors in the over 800 standard-setting committee meetings of Codex Alimentarius is exploited.

2019	86431	1015	Overshadowed Liberalism: Protectionism during Interstate Disputes	According to the conventional wisdom, domestic political concerns determine trade policies. In this paper, I argue that the current decline of the global free trade regime and the resurgence of protectionism cannot be explained by these domestic considerations alone. Therefore, I develop a theoretical model that reconsiders the role of trade policy as a foreign policy instrument. Criticizing and improving upon a recent paper on interstate bargaining (Fearon 2018), I show that trade wars are one important step in the escalation between foreign policy disagreement and violent conflict. In contrast to the aforementioned study, I conceptualize trade as an endogenous choice variable, along with arms level and conflict. States have to trade off using protectionist measures to hurt their opponent by giving up some of their own wealth, and risking escalation towards violent conflict by decreasing the economic interdependence between them. The theoretical argument is supported by an empirical investigation of protectionist and conflictual patterns in the 1870-2010 period, combining the CoW MID and CEPII TRADEHIST datasets.

2019	85946	671	New Evidence and New Methods for Analyzing the Iranian Revolution as an Intelligence Failure	Political intelligence often fails to anticipate major events in foreign countries such as revolutions, regime changes, or coup d’etats. The existing literature accounts for intelligence failure from various aspects: 1) bureaucratic/organizational pathology (Wohlstetter 1962), 2) intelligence network and information source (Jervis 2010), and 3) political psychology (Jervis 1976, 2010). US intelligence failure in the Iranian Revolution has been controversial both in academic and policy circles; yet, a truly systematic investigation of this failure has not been done. This paper conducts the first quantitative analysis of the Iranian revolution using newly declassified State Department cables from 1973-1979. A combination of methods including cable traffic analysis, discourse analysis, and network analysis is applied to the diplomatic documents to clarifying how insufficient intelligence networks and information sources undercut the US government’s ability to detect the political unrest in Iran. This study reveals that while empirical patterns of State Department cables are consistent with theoretical expectations and empirical findings by Jervis (1976, 2010), it highlights a necessity of further analysis of decision-makers’ perceptions and policy discussions, especially in the White House.

2019	80522	100	The Tyranny of Distance: Assessing and Explaining the Decline in U.S. Military Performance	There is a growing sense that U.S. military effectiveness has been on the wane in recent years. Observers have offered a number of explanations for declining American military success. Critics often emphasize normative themes that highlight putative moral or organizational shortcomings in U.S. culture or institutions. We offer a compatible, simpler and less pejorative account that relies on physical geography and prior success. Precisely because the United States did so well in the past, remaining conflicts are bound to be less tractable. For example, previous victories in the Western hemisphere mean that the United States is increasingly fighting farther from home. Distance is tyrannical. It saps military strength and increases the cost of contests, even as it reduces U.S. expertise and motivations to prevail. Indeed, this attenuation of interests and abilities with distance provides an objective basis for advocating a policy of military restraint.	Erik Gartzke, Patrick Hulme	NA
2019	77750	65	Populism and Conflict: Analyzing Populist Foreign Policy	The paper addresses the consequences of the rise of populism in Europe for international conflict. Although much has been written on the causes and timing of the rise of populism, what populists do once they are in power has not been systematically studied. The concern is that by fomenting nationalist and anti-liberal sentiments, weakening institutional checks and balances, erecting physical and economic boundaries, and dismissing criticism from international institutions, populists undermine the current international order. This process may lead to international conflict. But is it the case that once in office populists will be more prone to conflict? This paper addresses this question through systematic comparative study of populists in office. Conducting text analysis on legislation, policy decisions, and speeches, we compare populist and non-populist governments' potential for conflict based on shifts in military spending, foreign policy, trade policy, and the national narratives they promote.

2019	86141	797	Winning Coalitions, Partisanship, and the Strategic Calculus of Battlefield Casualties.	Wars are costly endeavors. Even the smallest wars require states to expend vast amounts of resources towards the destruction of enemy forces. Intense conflict requires even larger costs borne by citizens, such as increased taxes or commodity shortages. Additionally, citizens must bear the incomparable costs of losing loved ones, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Democratic leaders may try to shield their political supporters from paying some of these costs. As the civilian heads of the military, these leaders may keep their voters out of the fighting or by preventing them from being enlisted. In this paper we develop a theory of the incentives of democratic leaders to shield their supporters from the cost of war, and the means by which they may do this. We find strong evidence for our argument through an analysis of US casualties during the Vietnam war. We find higher casualty rates from counties that supported the political opponents of Presidents Johnson and Nixon. Our findings suggest that democratic leaders use their civilian control of the military for political ends.	Douglas Atkinson, Rene Lindstadt	NA
2019	84902	376	The Effect of Sanctions on Companies’ Foreign Direct Investment Decisions	Countries resort to economic coercion to compel other countries to change their policies. The success of this strategy depends on the size of economic costs that sanctioners can impose on their opponents by distorting trade and financial flows. Yet, existing studies indicate that governments and companies can adjust to such distortions, thereby reducing effectiveness of economic coercion. Specifically, research on sanctions’ effect on foreign direct investment indicates that sanctioning countries’ companies reduce their investments in targeted countries only temporarily, whereas companies from third-party countries take advantage of this temporary reduction by increasing their investment levels in targeted countries. The key limitation of this research, however, is its country-level focus, which fails to capture company-level decision-making processes and factors shaping them. In this paper, we consider how sanctions affect companies’ decisions to invest in a targeted country and how companies respond to the risk of investment substitution from third-party countries. We investigate effects of sanctions announced by companies’ home governments, as well as other governments, and consider varying responses of companies in different economic sectors.	Elena McLean	NA
2019	85960	681	Are Chinese Loans “door-openers” for subsequent Chinese FDI?	China has become a significant creditor to developing countries. Western companies complain that these loans are `door-openers’ for Chinese firms by increasing the likelihood of being awarded the necessary concessions by the recipient government. The argument suggests that Chinese loans increase Chinese FDI at the expense of investment by western firms. This paper analyzes if this claim is accurate. In addition, I check if this argument applies to other creditors as well. I find that loans from China do indeed increase subsequent FDI from China, but so do bilateral loans from France, Japan, and the United States. In contrast, bilateral lending by Brazil, India, Germany, and the United Kingdom do not increase FDI from these countries. I subsequently analyze why some counties exhibit the door-opener effect while others do not. In addition, I show that the door-opener effect operates through separate mechanisms for traditional lenders versus emerging creditors.	Jonas Bunte	NA
2019	86309	919	Corporate political strategy: How firms adapt to different institutional environments	Large corporations have both the resources and motivation to actively engage in the policymaking process, with the goal of shaping aspects of public policy. At the same time, national systems of interest intermediation provide important incentive structures and normative and institutional contexts for corporate behaviour. Yet, with the responsiveness and responsibility of national decision-making institutions varying according to the type of political system and mode of interest intermediation, it is surprising that cross system studies remain the exception. We argue that firms target policymakers that are at once cooperative and pivotal within the political system. We asses these arguments with survey data on 79 large corporations across the three largest Western economies: the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The results show that the quality of a firms’ relationship with policymakers is a key factor shaping corporate political strategy. Moreover, the distribution of corporate lobbying across venues reflects national variation in the distribution of decision-making powers. In particular, in the US, firms place significantly more emphasis on lobbying their bureaucracy compared to firms in Britain and Germany.	David Marshall	NA
2019	86485	1058	Into the Woods: Migration and the Bretton Woods Institutions	Many existing studies of international institutions emphasize major shareholders' strategic and special interests in explaining the behavior of an international organization. Focusing on the Bretton Woods institutions, we present a systemic theory of international institutions--Western policymakers envisioned the Bretton Woods institutions complementing one another in promoting and sustaining economic globalization. We argue that the aftermath of 1970s oil crisis prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to curb ``Third-World'' migration in attenuating globalization backlashes in the G5 countries, arising from global integration in trade and capital. Since migration is the most visible aspect of economic globalization, reducing migration inflows would assuage voter opposition to globalization in the developed world. Fully aware of the political need for their own electorates' support to sustain global economic integration in trade and capital, Western policymakers have decided to discard international migration as an element of the post-WWII global economic order. Our analysis of the IMF and the World Bank programs demonstrates that these institutions use their financial resources to reduce migration inflows--caused by financial crises and poverty, respectively--into wealthy developed democracies.

2019	85418	483	Truly two Globalizers? How IMF and World Bank lending conditions differ over time	Do the IMF and the World Bank prescribe similar “neoliberal” economic policies to borrowers? Prominent authors disagree: Stiglitz (2002) claims that the Bank is far more open to new ideas, while Woods (2006) puts both institutions in the same basket. In this paper, we present an organizational theory arguing that the Bank has autonomously pursued organizational change, specifically decentralization and mandate expansion. For a variety of reasons, the Fund has not pursued such change. As a result, the organizations’ lending practices and loan conditions have diverged over time. We draw on an extensive database of all qualitative conditions in World Bank and IMF loans since the 1980s and employ quantitative text analysis to measure textual distances between the institutions’ approaches. Our data clearly shows that the World Bank’s approach to conditionality has diverged from IMF’s over time. This has implications for understanding the relationship between the World Bank and IMF, as well as theorizing change in international organizations generally.	Ben Cormier, Mark Manger	NA
2019	85837	607	Multilateral aid to the rescue? Sectoral fragmentation of bilateral development aid and the role of the World Bank	Large donors of bilateral foreign aid are also the main funders for multilateral International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Bilateral and multilateral aid often go towards similar projects in the same sector, raising questions about the interactions between bilateral donors and IFIs and the possibility to reduce donor proliferation and increase coordination of aid delivery. Theoretically, IFIs should be well positioned to help overcome collective action problems associated with donor coordination. However, in this paper I argue that multilateral giving is flawed instrument for donor coordination. Donors fail to substitute multilateral for bilateral aid because of essential private benefits they derive from controlling bilateral aid flows. I investigate empirically whether the World Bank helps to fill gaps in sectors that receive insufficient bilateral aid and helps to increase coordination of bilateral giving across sectors. I find little evidence of this positive effect. Instead, World Bank engagement appears to free up bilateral donors to compete more intensely in a small number of sectors.	Martin Steinwand	NA
2019	75417	6	The Catalytic Effect of IMF Lending: Evidence from Sectoral FDI Data	Our study contributes to the search for the elusive ‘catalytic effect’ of International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending on inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Recent scholarship has found that the catalytic effect is conditional on political regime and program stringency. We contribute to this literature by developing and testing a theory which describes how the catalytic effect also varies by economic sector. Our findings corroborate previous research, which find that in general IMF lending has a substantial and negative effect on foreign direct investment. However, we find that the negative effect is concentrated in sectors that are highly dependent on external capital and have high sunk costs in the host country. Our findings are robust to several alternative explanations common in IMF literature, namely the importance of IMF program design and the ability of governments to make credible commitments to reform. Substantively, our findings suggest that investors are more likely to use IMF lending as an escape hatch in countries where FDI is dependent on external capital and has low sunk costs.

2019	86402	991	Topics of Interest: Speech Patterns in the IMF's Executive Board	Intergovernmental organizations are crucial actors in global governance, devising rules and norms that spread around the world with profound consequences for policymaking. The formal and material power of organizations’ member-states has long been recognized to impact upon their operations. Yet it is less clear how state representatives act within institutions, where frictions between material and ideational resources manifest themselves in day-to-day politics. To better understand such dynamics, we study the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund, a key organization underpinning the world economic order. Drawing on transcripts of Board meetings between 1995 and 2009, we investigate speech patterns of state representatives during deliberations. The text corpus encompasses 74,374 statements pertaining to 151 developing countries, which we examine using quantitative text analysis. First, we employ supervised, dictionary-based approaches to classify topics of interest and sentiments. Second, we utilize topic modeling, an unsupervised learning method, to extract the thematic structure of the statements. Taken together, this research opens the black box of intergovernmental organizations and puts forward a more nuanced account of how member-states affect these institutions.	Timon Forster	NA

Side-effects of the liberal sanction regime, 1989 to 2015	“I think this is a very hard choice, but … the price is worth it,” State Secretary Madeleine Albright said 1996 in response to a question about the humanitarian costs of the Iraq sanctions. The European Union, the United States and the United Nations have frequently relied on this instrument in the post-Cold War era to strengthen the liberal world order. Our paper examines the side-effects of this regime, comparing key aspects of public health provision in targeted and comparable non-targeted countries. We advance a novel theoretical argument that links the collateral damage of the sanctions to their scope and effectiveness. We maintain that only focused sanctions reach their goals of protecting and enforcing human rights and democracy without excessive human suffering in the target states. The empirical analysis relies on the new EUSANCT data set, relying on matching strategies to deal with endogeneity. The paper offers precise estimates of the effectiveness and humanitarian fallout of all sanctions by the EU, the US and the UN in the post-Cold War era.	Gerald Schneider	NA
2019	75912	30	Surveillance Games: The International Political Economy of Combatting Financial Crime	Capital markets, where we trade everything from company stocks to foreign currencies, have become increasingly global over the last 30 years. Nevertheless, the identification and prevention of illicit activity (e.g., insider trading and market manipulation) is still left to national regulators. But because these regulators are unable to observe trading activity that occurs in other jurisdictions, they are severely hamstrung in their ability to combat transnational financial crime. This paper seeks to understand why there is so little international cooperation on the surveillance of global capital markets. Drawing on the insights of two-level game theory and historical institutionalism, I posit that power dynamics between regulators, exchanges and large market participants at the domestic level is the primary determinant of whether we should expect to observe international cooperation on market surveillance. The arguments' expectations are tested against five qualitative case studies, utilising novel empirical evidence collected from archival material; newly disclosed documents obtained from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through a Freedom of Information Act request; and over 60 interviews conducted in London, Toronto, New York and Washington, D.C.

2019	85968	686	The political determinants of transfer pricing regulations in developing countries	Despite the fact that many developing countries rely heavily on tax revenues from multinational corporations (MNCs) as a main government revenue source, it is reported that many MNCs pay less in taxes by shifting their income generated in host countries to low (or zero) tax rate countries through transfer pricing. Although many developing countries regulate these tax planning practices– transfer pricing by MNCs-, the degree of transfer pricing regulations varies across countries. In this article, I explain for such a pattern by arguing that countries with strong rule of law are less likely to tighten transfer-pricing regulations. The reason is that MNCs are more likely to enter into countries with the strong rule of law and thereby give more voices over the policymaking process in their favorable direction. Using a dataset on transfer pricing regulations in 21 developing countries between 2001 and 2011, my findings conform to the theoretical expectation.	Mi Jeong Shin	NA
2019	86472	1048	The Financialization of Foreign Policy: Targeted Financial Sanctions and Government Retaliation	Over the last fifteen years, the nature of international economic coercion shifted from broad economic sanctions to targeted financial measures. Targeted financial sanctions, imposed as asset freezes and cessation of business relations with targeted firms, can prompt a retaliatory response from the target government, with implications for the relationship between sender and target countries. Under what conditions do governments retaliate in response to targeted financial sanctions imposed on their domestic firms? Retaliation is likely when the government is the intended target of the coercion and when the sanctions are imposed against politically relevant firms. I investigate this relationship using newly collected data on U.S. and Canadian targeted financial sanctions imposed on firms since 2001. First, I argue that the differentiation of sanctions policies based on the intended target of the coercion is necessary. Targeted financial sanctions are used against firms as a conduit to their government and against firms for their own behaviour, a distinction often missing from analyses of targeted sanctions. Second, I propose a conceptualization of government vulnerability to financial sanction costs as an explanation for retaliatory responses.	Caileigh Glenn	NA
2019	86250	878	Sanctioned or Stoned: The Strategic Imposition of Drug-Related Sanctions	How do economic and geopolitical interests affect the imposition of sanctions? In this paper, I analyze drug-related sanctions by the United States since the institutional framework of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act offers three important advantages for research on the strategic imposition of sanctions. First, the annual report of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement offers a well-defined universe of potential sanction cases by listing all major drug transit and producing countries. Second, considering national interest waivers for decertified drug transit or producing countries as a sanction threat makes the coding of threats consistent. And third, the sender cannot vary the sanctions’ intensity since the measures always consist of withdrawing foreign assistance. This combination of a complete universe of cases as well as both consistent sanction threats and measures solves common methodological problems in the previous research on economic sanctions. Based on a unique dataset on drug-related US sanctions, I empirically test competing hypotheses on the strategic imposition of sanctions. I find that sanctions are biased towards countries which are both economically and geopolitically less relevant for the sender.	Patrick Weber	NA
2019	86543	1110	The Origins and Evolution of Liberal Interventionism: A Typology Proposed.	Recent studies of liberal intervention and state-building tend to focus on the extreme cases of outright military intervention. David Lake’s (2016) The Statebuilder’s Dilemma is but one recent example. While these costly liberal military interventions to build democratic institutions can be traced back to Thomas Paine’s(1792) promise to join Lafayette in a ‘campaign’ to abolish ‘German despotism,’ liberal state-building has manifested itself in a wide range of foreign policies. This paper explores a range of policies based on American foreign policy over the past century and propose a typology that will provide a more complete survey of liberal state building. Among these policies are encouraging free trade, constructive engagement, membership in international organizations, public diplomacy, social and educational exchanges, encouraging aspirational treaties like the Helsinki Accords, election monitoring, foreign aid to the state and to democratic forces within the state, sanctioning states and individuals for non-democratic practices, limited strategic military actions, and finally military intervention and occupation. With this exhaustive typology, we can begin to evaluate the effectiveness of liberal state-building efforts in a more thorough manner.	Thomas Walker	NA
2019	85656	527	From the Outside In: Fear, Security Agencies, and the Corrosion of Parliamentary Democracy. Findings from the Garrison State Project	Eighty years ago, Harold Lasswell argued that “specialists on violence” would play an ever-greater role in democracies, dominating numerous activities and unaccountable to the public. Updated and put differently, fear of foreign or domestic threats, combined with organizational inertia in agencies created to counter those threats, render the agencies’ activities and size increasingly unquestioned by legislators: there will be significant decline in oversight and parliamentary discussion of security agencies. For the last four years, we have generated data and tested hypotheses about these claims. The findings support Lasswell: since 1947, parliaments in all democracies, regardless of population, alliance membership, or colonial past, have increasingly restricted debate (how much talk and about what) on the size and role of security agencies. Thus in every country, security issues have moved toward becoming democratic no-go zones.	Juliette Ganne, Laura Schenker	NA
2019	86312	921	Why Interdisciplinary Approaches between International Law and International Relations are still possible and necessary	In a more recent chapter of research between International Relations (IR) and International Law (IL) it appears that authors, once eminent in their advocacy of interdisciplinary approaches, have taken a step back. Specialists from either field, demoralized by the engagement between the two disciplines, have returned to the fold of their respective fields, strengthening their theoretical boundaries. But is countering interdisciplinary moves with progressive positivism and formalism from the legal perspective and politization of law from the other, really the right response? The interdisciplinary methods of the past have mainly consisted of a realist perspective on law, limiting the understanding of the entire body of international law to legal positivism. But also liberal perspectives have not succeeded in building a view of international law that could stand up to its critics. The by now known lacunae that even constructivist IR theory has not found a profound way of engaging with law, needs to be addressed. This paper attempts to do so, by engaging with the normative approaches in IR and the more recent interpretivist and practice approaches in IL.	Anna Knaps	NA
2019	86385	980	International Organization Death	The proliferation of international organizations (IOs) in the post-WW2 era has prompted international relations scholars to look in-depth at their formation and effectiveness. When and why these organizations die has by comparison been conspicuously absent from research, even though both recent events and more historical data show that IO termination is not unusual. We develop a theory of IO death by first, defining different types of death, and second, arguing that death is triggered by legitimacy crises in individual member states, depending on the age of an IO. We demonstrate this proposition on a new data set of all IOs in existence since 1990 that includes information on IO characteristics and member states’ domestic attributes. Multilevel survival analyses show the extent to which individual member state preferences can influence IO decay and ultimately death. The paper thus ultimately contributes to a novel and important research area in international relations, advancing the literature on international cooperation writ-large.	Loriana Crasnic	NA
2019	86063	736	Security Semiosis and the Securitization of Asylum in Sweden (2010-2018)	This paper argues that a the political, illocutionary speech act model advanced by the Copenhagen School is capable of anatomizing power relations, the agency of audiences, and the cognitive context in order to understand just how and why the securitization of asylum has been resisted in Sweden. An illocutionary speech act model posits an inductive poststructuralist framework for securitization theory. Successful securitization, I argue, hinges on a reflective, reflexive, cognitive process – the semiosis of security. In this paper, an analysis of Swedish asylum policy from 2010 to 2018 (since the entry of the Sweden Democrats into the Riksdag) is used to demonstrate the weak explanatory power of the pragmatic approach in the theoretical conceptualization of securitization. In recent years, the Swedish government’s resistance of the securitization of asylum advanced by the Sweden Democrats demonstrates the strength of shared hegemonic norms on human rights and the dominance of intrinsic, normative qualities of a constructed threat over extrinsic facts that arise from an ‘objective’ assessment of the actuality of the threat.

2019	81398	126	Convergence and Competition in Global Governance: Discourse Analysis of the Major Powers’ Value Perceptions in the United Nations General Assembly Debates	The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is a central arena for countries to express their perspectives on global governance. Most of the existing literature focuses on how nations vote in UNGA but overlooks what they say. This paper examines the differences and similarities among major powers’ discourse in the UNGA using an automated content analysis method. We select key norms in the global governance through the UN as content categories, which include security, development, human rights and democracy. Based on automated classification of UN General Debate corpus, we reveal the contrasting structures of discourse made by major powers. We also investigate major powers’ attitudes towards these topics by conducting sentiment analysis on each category. Our results show, for instance, that US discussed much less on development than other countries but more on democracy and human rights. China and Japan have a very similar topic pattern, although their voting behaviors are disparate. These results shed light on major power’s view on global norms. It also provides a new methodological insight to constructivist school of international relations.	Yuan Zhou, Kaoru Kurusu	NA
2019	84348	290	Regime Type and Multilateral Cooperation in the UN General Assembly	The UN General Assembly (UNGA) is frequently considered the stage of world politics. Yet the UNGA is also crucial to the development of international norms and, ultimately, international law. This norm-generating function of the UNGA is reflected in its resolutions and decisions. In this article, we study the changing patterns of UNGA co-authorship from 1991 to 2017. We expect that, after an initial phase of reorientation during 1990s, regime type has regained relevance for explaining cooperation patterns in the UNGA. On the empirical side, our paper presents the first large-scale analysis of co-authorship in the UNGA. We find that the co-authorship of resolutions reflects slow-changing, structural variables such as social, political, and economic differences. Specifically, we show how the open and flexible cooperation patterns during the 1990s slowly moved towards a new bipolarity structured by regime type.	Daniel Finke	NA
2019	86394	986	Talk and Action in the United Nations General Assembly - Vote-buying and the power to induce states to vote against their own preferences	Countries often say one thing in speeches but do the other when they vote. Why is this the case? While unexpected voting behavior is usually ascribed to vote-buying, it has not yet been directly tested to what extent money induces a country to vote against its own preferences. Focusing on vote-buying as an explanation for the differences in votes and speeches can help to overcome this problem. Accordingly, rich countries buy votes to legitimize their actions in international organizations vis-à-vis their domestic audience and reveal their preferences as focal points to potential supports in the international arena via speeches. Poor countries, by contrast, advocate for national interests in their speeches but deviate from them to comply with the preferences of the donor in order to extract aid. Hence, poor countries’ votes and speeches differ systematically as a result of vote-buying. I test this argument by predicting UN General Assembly votes from UN General Debate speeches and expect to find lower prediction accuracy for aid-recipients than for donors. If my theory holds, this systematic difference is the result of donor aid.	Dennis Hammerschmidt	NA
2019	84410	305	Networks in international organizations: how governance principles influence the rise, orientation, and evolution of World Bank trust funds	IR scholars pay increasing attention to markets as drivers of international cooperation. In international development, market principles pervade donor decision-making about foreign aid allocation and delivery. An important aspect of this trend is that like-minded (as in pro-market) donor governments cooperate to promote market-driven development policies, while the ones who do not share this view are less likely to engage in this mode of cooperation. In this article, we use multi-linear regression and network analysis to explore patterns of collaboration between donors through trust funds. Trust funds are ad-hoc policy venues and financing vehicles hosted by international organizations. They allow like-minded donors to support joint priority areas, while also acting as conduits for developing and disseminating best policy practices. We find support for our explanation for donor collaboration using Exponential Random Graph Models. Our project thus contributes to the study of international cooperation by mapping donor political economies to networks of donor cooperation.	Bernhard Reinsberg	NA
2019	77594	63	Organization Works: Hours of Work and the International Labor Organization	What is the impact of international organizations on social policy? Existing studies have examined the role of the International Labor Organization (ILO) by exploring the relationship between ratification of labor conventions and social expenditure. In contrast, we argue that the central mechanisms provided in favor of ratifications shaping policy, instead apply to becoming an ILO member and formulating conventions, not ratifying conventions. We test this using a new dataset on working time regulations between 1848 and 1990. First, we show that states that ratified the 48-hour week convention (C001) reduced their hours beforehand, with the long-term effect of C001 on hours being insignificant. Second, dealing with reverse causality by only analyzing ILO membership of Versailles treaty signatories, we find that membership is associated with a reduction in working time in the long-term. Third, following the adoption of a working time convention at General Conference of the ILO, hours tend to decrease, independent of whether a member ratifies said convention. Our findings indicate that ratification of conventions are not necessary for a convention to exert effect on policy.	Magnus Bergli Rasmussen	NA
2019	85336	457	Explaining Diplomatic Deliberative Practices in International Organizations	When we look at the formal rules of International Organizations (IOs), we see that IOs adopt different institutional design features in balancing between extensive deliberation and swift decision making. How are these features put into practice and what explains variation in the pattern of diplomatic deliberative practices between IOs? Drawing on unique and novel survey data, the paper explores the actual usage of institutional rules by the diplomats operating in IOs. On this basis, the paper uses functionalist and new institutionalism theories in order to develop hypotheses on variation, fit, and mismatch in institutional design and diplomatic deliberative practices within and across 45 different IOs. The hypotheses are comprehensively analyzed with quantitative methods. This provides novel insights into the inner working of institutions as well as into practices which limit the effect of deliberative design features or which operate as functional equivalents for formal institutional rules.

2019	86301	914	Minimal Participation Criteria in International Treaties: Explaining Their Impact on Multilateral Cooperation	States willing to cooperate internationally face a common conundrum: incentives for free-riding can undermine collective efforts that would otherwise improve the welfare of everyone involved. IR and legal scholars have long argued that the rational design of international institutions mitigates collective action problems. This literature emphasises differences in the scope, flexibility, precision and delegation of treaty provisions, among other things. We show that another important aspect is often overlooked. International treaties may include thresholds that specify a minimum number of ratifying parties necessary for the agreement to enter into force. Because treaties generate externalities only then, such criteria have an important impact on how signatory states jointly produce public goods. When and why do states add minimum thresholds to international treaties? What explains the variation in threshold design? And how do these thresholds affect ratification? We analyse the complete ratification record of all multilateral agreements deposited with the UN since 1945. Our analysis demonstrates that ratification thresholds can be an effective bulwark against free riding, underscoring the importance of treaty design for international cooperation.	Christian Arnold	NA
2019	83910	245	Time for Discussions? The Institutional Design of International Organizations between Diplomatic Deliberation and Speedy Decision-Making	When looking at procedural rules of International Organizations (IOs) we see that they create room for deliberation, yet simultaneously restrict the time available for discussion. While the former is supposed to increase the quality and legitimacy of IO decisions, the latter ensures a swift decision-making process. How do IOs reconcile these two competing goals? Do IOs differ in this respect, and if so, how and why? The paper draws on a unique and novel dataset to assess how institutional design fosters or inhibits diplomatic deliberation in more than 120 IOs. On this basis, the paper uses theories of neo-functionalism, rational choice institutionalism and liberal approaches to develop hypotheses on variation across IOs. The hypotheses are analyzed with quantitative methods, revealing several interesting insights: First, the institutional designs of IOs differ considerably with regard to diplomatic deliberation. Second, small size of IOs, delegates who can flexibly adjust their positions during negotiations, and regional membership criteria foster highly deliberative institutional designs. Third, the combination of three theoretical approaches is well-suited to account for variation in the diplomatic deliberative design of IOs.	Franziska Hohlstein	NA
2019	79120	81	The Rise and Fall of International Organizations	(Organized panel: 'International Organizations in Times of Conflict and Withdrawals') The liberal order, some say, is in unprecedented crisis. But this paper shows that international organizations (IOs) have always faced crises, some of which proved fatal to the IO. Furthermore, sentiment about international cooperations among scholars across disciplines -- economics, law, political science, and area studies -- has fluctuated in accordance with the fates of those IOs. This paper uses text analysis and topic modeling to track scholarly sentiment about IOs across disciplines, as a function of the vitality of IOs over time. I show that the current hand-wringing about international cooperation has historical precedent: scholarly enthusiasm for IOs has moved in lockstep with the rise and fall of various IOs themselves. I show the emergence of a particular paradigm after the fall of the Berlin Wall: the normative victory of global cooperation, as well as the empirical pattern of countries forming and joining IOs (and the emergence of quantitative methods that overly weighted those new IOs), led to overly bullish sentiment among IO scholars, despite pessism in the previous decades.

2019	84056	263	The Costs of Membership Withdrawal from Intergovernmental Organizations	Recent events have brought increased attention to countries withdrawing from intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). What are the effects of IGO withdrawals? By focusing on withdrawals from regional economic organizations, this paper provides the first systematic examination of the economic consequences of withdrawal. We argue that just as states join international economic organizations as part of an embedded liberal bargain, states anticipate that retreating from an IGO could lead to costs which they try to forestall through domestic stability policies. To estimate the causal effect of withdrawal from observational data, we leverage the synthetic control method and an original dataset of IGO withdrawals. We find strong support for our argument. First, states are unlikely to witness large economic costs because they anticipate potential costs and establish work-around strategies including using expansionary monetary policies or forum-shopping to an alternative overlapping organization. However, withdrawing states are likely to witness political costs because international investors and analysts may adjudicate the state’s retreat negatively because they have reneged on an international commitment, resulting in a lower assessment of the state’s political risk.

2019	84393	300	International Organizations and the Reassertion of National Sovereignty	Recent reassertions of national sovereignty have culminated in a new crisis of multilateralism that challenges the role and the existence of IOs: The United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union (EU), African states threatened to leave the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United States government is reducing its funding to leading IOs. In the current discourse, this phenomenon is discussed as being exceptional in its extent and degree. However, the struggle between the delegation and the preservation of national sovereignty has characterized the relationship between IOs and their member states for decades. In this paper, I develop a conceptual framework to analyze the patterns of the reassertion of national sovereignty. I propose four different types of how states reassert their sovereignty, namely budget cuts, staff obstruction, non-compliance with core norms and membership withdrawal. By taking into consideration the justifications of member states for reasserting their sovereignty, I distinguish these acts from the instrumentalization or the politicization of an IO. I illustrate this with first empirical insights into the patterns of sovereignty challenges against IOs between 1920 and 2018.	Gisela Hirschmann	NA
2019	86232	865	Referendums on International Cooperation: Between Integration and Disintegration	The liberal world order is increasingly being challenged by domestic opposition, especially by populist political forces. This development has made it increasingly difficult for governments to control domestic dynamics, and made public votes in favor of non-cooperation or even disintegration more likely. While much research has focused on the causes of this popular contestation, much less is known about how it affects foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Our paper explores the consequences of non-cooperative referendum votes for the evolution and stability of international institutions. We argue that the systemic outcomes of such votes vary systematically depending on the interplay between crucial two factors: 1) the degree to which the international organization accommodates the non-cooperative referendum outcome; and 2) domestic acceptance of the IO response. Our analysis of 17 non-cooperative referendums relating to European integration held between 1972 and 2016 suggests that both the IO response and its domestic reception influenced whether a non-cooperative referendum vote increases the stability of the international institution, or results in highly politicized, unstable outcomes that present a long-term challenge to the international institution.

2019	79628	85	An Examination of How the United States Reports on Refugee Crises Over Time	This project examines the prevalence of refugee issues in US human rights reporting over time. Employing text analysis techniques developed for the Sub-National Analysis of Repression Project, this paper will explore how much attention is given to refugee issues in the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which have been published since the 1970’s to inform foreign aid decision-making. Drawing upon literature of foreign-policy making, this project will examine more how the shifts in the bureaucratic organization of the State department itself, as well as congressional action, leads to changes in how concerns about refugees are reflected in the US reporting on the topic. This project will be helpful in understanding how refugee policy varies in salience over time and the degree to which it becomes a standard priority of the American foreign-policy making establishment.

2019	86566	1130	What Drives Expenditure Allocation in IOs? Problem Pressure, Donor Interests, and Bureaucratic Resource Mobilization in the UNHCR and IOM	Resources are key to the power of international organizations (IOs) and their bureaucracies. As most IOs cannot rely only on assessed state contributions, the overall availability of resources depends largely on voluntary funding. There is, however, little knowledge about what drives the allocation of these resources. Does resourcing reflect country-level needs or is allocation rather driven by donor state interest? Focusing on refugee and forced migration policy in the United Nations system, we present an original dataset including both donor contributions and country-level expenditures for the two lead agencies responsible: UNHCR and IOM. We assess the extent to which expenditures in both agencies reflect shifts in the distribution of the global refugee population. In addition, we assess donor influence over expenditures, proxied for by their contribution to the agency. We show that the UNHCR is highly responsive to shifts in refugee flows, while IOM is not. Donors, however, influence expenditure allocation in heterogeneous ways, suggesting the need to further unpack the different strategies donors can use to exert their influence at various points in time.

2019	82531	169	Complexity and Compliance in the Inter-American Human Rights System	Research on international regimes has increasingly focused on the role of institutional complexity. Also, research has shown the growing level of complexity of human rights regimes. Even though the human rights literature has largely focused on explanations of the conditions under which countries comply with their obligations, whether and how institutional complexity affects the compliance record of countries remains largely unknown. This paper aims to fill this gap and looks at the influence of treaty ratification on compliance through the angle of regime complexity. We investigate the link between institutional complexity and compliance with respect to the Inter-American Human Rights System. In a first part, the paper presents a theoretical argument why and how institutional complexity influences compliance with human rights. In the second part, we rely on a measure of institutional complexity based on states’ subscription to human rights treaties and their decision density on human rights to analyze the effect of complexity on compliance. Results based on the prohibition of torture show that complexity influences the level of compliance, however, not necessarily in the expected direction.	Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, Simone Wegmann	NA
2019	84326	282	Raising issues of fairness and harm: Individual opinions in the European Court of Human Rights	Judges frequently use language strategically. Extant scholarship focused on the rhetorical strategies majority opinions employ to persuade external audiences. Less is known about how judges craft their individual opinions and what functions such opinions might serve. We argue that judges use individual opinions strategically to influence the future direction of case law and they do this by invoking considerations of fairness and harm rather than pure legal language. Accordingly, we expect dissenting opinions to contain more of the aforementioned rhetorical strategy than other types of individual opinions and that the reliance on such language will increase as the ideological distance between the dissenting judge and the majority judges increases. We evaluate our argument using quantitative text analysis on more than 3,000 individual opinions authored by judges from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Appointed from 47 different states, ECtHR judges often disagree concerning the application of human rights law. In this context, we show that rhetorical strategies employed in individual opinions offer unique insights into how judges respond to disagreements and view the future role of the Court.

2019	84908	379	Green Contracts: The Global Environment Facility and the Politics of Procurement	Studies of multilateral aid organizations suggest that they balance formal rules and informal influence at all stages of the project cycle – from project identification to procurement and project evaluation. The focus of existing research is primarily on development programs, which represent one sector of multilateral assistance. This paper explores the interaction of formal rules and informal influence in an environmental organization – the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Implementation of environmental projects requires purchases of goods and services; hence, the GEF’s funding flows to suppliers in all eligible countries. On the one hand, such purchases follow procurement procedures that rely on competitive bidding, which maximize efficient use of scarce financial resources. On the other hand, donor and recipient countries seek to extract private benefits from the GEF’s funding by allocating more contracts to their preferred suppliers. I use data on contract awards for GEF-funded projects from 1995 through 2015 to evaluate patterns of contract allocation and identify beneficiaries of GEF-funded project procurement.	Elena McLean	NA
2019	83978	256	Domestic Losers, Foreign Winners? Support for Climate Action under Weak International Institutions	The Paris Climate Agreement emphasizes strong domestic policy for future climate action. However, we know little about whether and how voters support domestic climate action when international climate agreements are weak. The climate politics literature is largely divided into those who argue that individuals take foreign action into account when formulating their own preferences for domestic policy, while others contend that the foreign climate does not shape support for domestic action. Responding to this debate, we study how voters in representative democracies position themselves towards domestic climate policy that is only loosely linked to international governance. We investigate voter-level support for different attributes of national climate action with a survey experiment in the United Kingdom to see whether and how informational treatments about the costs and benefits of strong domestic climate action generate “losers versus winners” sentiments among the public. Critically, we also investigate how domestic voter preferences vary as voters learn about the implications from climate policy abroad. This research will help us adjudicate between theoretical explanations for national climate action in a weakly institutionalized global climate order.	Patrick Bayer, Federica Genovese	NA
2019	85177	412	How climate change leads to emigration:Transmission channels, conditional and long-run effects	We study the effect of climate change on migration from a sample of 95 developing and emerging countries to 20 OECD countries between 1976 and 2010. We find that the effect of climate change on migration is conditional upon initial levels of economic development in sending countries as well as the type of migration. Climate change (especially in the form of increasing temperatures) leads to more out-migration by the low-skilled in relatively poor and to less medium-skilled migration in relatively rich countries; there is no effect of climate change on high-skilled migration. Analyzing potential transmission channels, we find that in the relatively poor countries of our sample climate change reduces agricultural production, economic growth and fertility but promotes urbanization and political instability, while promoting industrialization in the relatively rich countries. Finally, we also provide long-run estimates of the effect of climate change on migration, which yield findings similar to our panel estimates.	Marc Helbling	NA
2019	86264	888	Targeting the most climate-vulnerable countries? Comparing the allocation of German bilateral and multilateral adaptation finance	Does Germany's climate change adaptation finance target the most climate-vulnerable countries? Climate vulnerability might play a more important role in the allocation of multilateral than bilateral aid. Potential recipient countries of adaptation aid are required to provide multilateral organisations with climate risk and vulnerability assessments, in order to qualify for funding. Most of Germany's adaptation aid is bilateral and climate vulnerability might be less important in the allocation of this funding; specifically, less rigorous vulnerability assessments are demanded and allocation is more strongly determined by other factors. As vulnerability assessments require the necessary technical and financial capacity by recipient countries, the effect of climate vulnerability on aid allocation by multilaterals is likely moderated by the capacity to provide such assessments. We test these hypotheses using aid data from the Creditor Reporting System and various climate risk and vulnerability indices for all recipient countries of German climate finance from 2010-2016. Our results have systemic implications and contribute to the understanding of bilateral and multilateral aid allocation.	Mascha Rauschenbach	NA
2019	79633	86	Arms Transfers and the Dynamics of Intervention	Why do states augment their formal alliance commitments with material arms transfers in some cases but not others? Existing work focuses on the informational value of arms transfers, viewing them as costly signals of an ally's commitment to the protege. In this paper, I provide a distinct, complete-information explanation: arms transfers alter the balance of power and can mitigate power shifts, eliminating commitment problems. To do this, I develop a formal model in which a defender, protege, and challenger interact repeatedly over an infinite horizon. When the future balance of power is certain, the ally never transfers arms. However, when a power shift is expected, arms transfers may occur in equilibrium as they prevent the protege from initiating a preventive war. I then use the theoretical results to shed light on historical patterns of arms transfers between major powers and their proteges.	Bradley Smith	NA
2019	79728	88	Strategic Nuclear Latency and Extended Deterrence Relations	How does the development of nuclear latency - the ability to build nuclear weapons - affect a state’s ability to secure a place under the U.S. nuclear umbrella? The United States’ has long opposed nuclear proliferation. However, empirically, many U.S. allies have chosen to research and develop nuclear capabilities. Existing theories do not account for the interrelated strategic choices to enter alliances and to pursue nuclear weapons, nor do empirical estimates incorporate this strategic behavior. This paper constructs a strategic probit model based on a new theory in which weaker states strategically manipulate nuclear latency to influence strong states' alliance offers. Strong states select weak states into alliances based on latency to change their nuclear development calculus. The estimates overturn two pieces of conventional wisdom. First, nuclear latency can reverse the traditional fears of abandonment and push past entrapment concerns in uncertain security environments to drive alliance formation. Second, I show that high latency states that are militarily strong can use latency to secure alliance guarantees.	Justin Nicholson	NA
2019	81565	136	The Dark Side of the Force: Threat Perception, Bilateralism and the Origins of the U.S-Australia Alliance	What are the origins of the United States alliance with Australia and New Zealand, and what do they reveal about the trade-offs of bilateral and multilateral alliance designs? International Relations scholarship has almost exclusively focussed on European alliances prior to 1945 and Washington’s alliances with its NATO allies, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan since then. Literature that puzzles at multilateralism in Europe and bilateralism in Asia is either inconclusive or cannot explain why by 1951 Truman ultimately wanted Japan and many of its wartime adversaries in a multilateral alliance. This paper makes two contributions. First, it contributes to debates about threat perception by showing that Australian insecurities in the early Cold War were mostly directed not at Moscow or Beijing but Australia’s then vanquished wartime adversary Japan. Second, it argues that bilateralism may offer greater insurance against entrapment but carries additional assurance costs. Truman could not achieve a multilateral alliance in Asia because Australia and others would not join an alliance with Japan. Their consent to the Japan settlement required additional alliances that raised assurance problems.	Michael Cohen	NA
2019	86335	941	PhD Training and Gender Differences in Political Methodology in Europe	Recently, a number of studies have shed light into the ways in which gender disparities continue to persist in academia, disadvantaging women from graduate school to tenured positions. Gender disparities have been found to be particularly pronounced in the subfield of political methodology, with women being less likely to employ quantitative methods than their male peers, publish articles that emphasize quantitative methods (Teele and Thelen 2017), and attend methods-focused conferences and events (Barnes and Beaulieu 2017; Barnes, Beaulieu and Krupnikov 2014; Esarey 2017). Still, much remains unknown about whether female and male postgraduate students acquire different methods training. Outside the US context, many doctoral programs do not have fixed graduate programs, potentially making the gender gap in methods specialisms even wider. We contribute to this discussion by employing an original survey covering the methods training of postgraduate students in European universities. We also complement our analysis by employing two surveys with applicants and participants of the first and second editions of the Zurich Summer School for Women in Political Methodology.

2019	75593	14	A Phantom Menace: Random Data, Model Specification and Causal Inference in Qualitative Comparative Analysis	To date, the method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been employed by hundreds of researchers. At the same time, the literature has long been convinced that QCA is prone to committing causal fallacies when confronted with random data. Specifically, beyond a certain case-to-factor ratio, QCA is believed to not be able to distinguish anymore between random and real data. In consequence, applied researchers relying on QCA have worried that the explanatory models presented to them would be nothing but algorithmic artifacts. So as to minimize that risk, benchmark tables of boundary case-to-factor ratios have been proposed by Marx and Dusa (2011). We demonstrate in this article that these benchmarks are misleading, as to every proper causal structure there exists a set of purely stochastic data that is isomorphic to the data generated by this structure. What is more, these benchmarks force QCA to commit causal fallacies instead of preventing them. Ultimately, we argue that random data are a phantom menace which applied researchers need not worry about when designing their analyses with QCA.	Alrik Thiem	NA
2019	84328	283	(Re-)Building the Social Contract in Fragile States:Designing a Qualitative Metaketa	How do communities (re-)build the social contract in conflict and post-conflict states? What strategies and challenges exist for communities to mold the social contract? We propose to explore these questions through a methodologically innovative approach: the first “Metaketa” initiative to focus on qualitative data and research. The project expands the model of the Metaketa initiative initiated by the Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) network to focus on external validity, causal inference and hypothesis testing using qualitative data. In applying the Metaketa model, the project will coordinate six research teams to use overlapping measurements, pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, joint tools of analysis, and secondary analysis of qualitative data to address our joint research question (as well as a variety of sub-questions) across different cases. Teams will study the actions of the various actors involved in forging the social contract – ranging from governments, local non-governmental organizations and activists, development agencies, international organizations, and of course local constituents themselves. This paper sets out the design parameters of the proposed approach, and describes possible opportunities and potential pitfalls.	Florian Kern, Alexandra Hartman	NA
2019	81623	141	Classifying Newspaper Articles with Supervised Machine Learning: A New Approach with Tests on Hungarian Media Corpora	The paper offers a step-by-step presentation of our new methodological solution for coding public policy topics in the content of media articles with no, deficiently reliable or limited training sets. We combine a quantitative text mining approach with supervised learning methods and limited human coding in ordet to classify the front-page articles of two leading Hungarian daily newspapers. The initial database for 'Nepszabadsag' consisted of 53,316 articles, 11,342 of which had been hand-coded for policy topic. In the first step our goal was to classify the remaining items in the dataset based on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. Next, we set the coded corpora as the training set for categorizing 'Magyar Nemzet' articles. Our results show that for the latter, our approach provided better precision results than what is customary for human coders. Nevertheless, this high precision came at the expense of low estimated recall - a task for future refinements for our workflow.	Miklos Sebok	NA
2019	85465	493	A Computer Assisted Search Strategy for Digital Text Archives Stored on Remote Servers	Search strategy development, creating a process to recover a subset of documents via Boolean search from a large text archive usually stored on a remote server, is the (unheralded) first step in most text analysis. This step is challenging, e.g., it is difficult to think of all relevant keywords, and important because subsequent results fundamentally depend on it. Recent work demonstrates the potential for semi-automated algorithms to assist with developing a search strategy and shows that it can improve performance compared to experts working alone. However, those processes cannot be implemented in the usual case where the text archive is stored on a remote server, because the algorithms require the full text of all cases to be available, and does not address questions such as how many keywords are needed. We propose a complete search strategy based on new semi-automated machine learning algorithms for document recovery that can be used even when the material is stored on a remote server. We evaluate our algorithm performance in a case study on the British Newspaper Archive (28 million articles).	Gidon Cohen, Patrick Kuhn	NA
2019	86293	908	Sentiment Analysis: what is great and what sucks?	Sentiment is central to political communication. Automatic sentiment analysis, however, is difficult due to the inherent subjectivity and domain- and specificities. Many studies have relied on dictionaries of positive and negative terms. The validity of these dictionaries is very limited, however, as dictionaries do not correlate well with each other or with human expert coding. Thus, many scholars advocate using crowd coding, machine learning, and/or domain and task-adapted dictionaries. It is unclear, however, which of these techniques is appropriate for what tasks, and what level of validity can be attained at what human effort. In this paper, we will compare these techniques on a single data set and show how crowd coding, machine learning, and domain adaptation interact. We compare the results of 7 different ways of doing sentiment analysis: 1. manual expert coding; 2. crowd coding; 3.machine learning based on expert codes; 4. machine learning based on crowd coding; 5. Off-the-shelf sentiment dictionary; 6. Expert domain-aparted sentiment dictionary; and 7. a domain adapted sentiment dictionary. This comparison gives insight into the state of the art in sentiment analysis.	Mariken van der Velden	NA
2019	86535	1103	Active Learning Approaches for Labeling Text: Review and Assessment of the Performance of Active Learning Approaches	Supervised machine learning methods are employed at an increasing rate in political science. Such models require costly manual labeling of documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders is not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study its benefits using the example of text data. We perform a series of experiments to identify the conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these experiments on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in all cases where the document class of interest is not perfectly balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the labeled documents one would need using random sampling (or passive' learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of inter-coder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that with low-reliability, active learning can lead to decreased performance.

2019	85008	399	“I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means”: Evaluating the Validity of Coding Open-Ended Survey Responses	As public opinion researchers, we often ask open-ended survey questions that we then code according to a pre-defined codebook. In turn, we infer preferences and sentiments from these codes. Yet are we getting valid responses when we assign our codes to people’s statements? We explore this question using data from 1,747 MTurk respondents who gave open-ended responses on the causes of poverty and then coded their own responses as attributing responsibility to the individual or government/society. We then compare their self-coding of their responses to our coding, using Iyengar’s original codebook, which has been used to establish much of our understanding of episodic/thematic framing effects. We find that for many responses, our codebook-based codes do a reasonable job of matching how respondents code their own responses. For other types of responses, however, our codebook-based codes do a poor job of accurately categorizing responses in line with how respondents intended them. These results indicate that respondents may see more nuance than we account for when we apply our codes, potentially resulting in substantively different findings.	Rebecca Glazier	NA
2019	83122	204	Modelling Heterogeneity Using Complex Sparsity	Data analysis starts by making theoretically informed assumptions about the structure of the world. Yet, we also typically have reasons for expecting certain types of heterogeneity in our analysis (e.g. temporally or spatially varying effects). This paper provides a unified framework for modelling the most common sorts of heterogeneity by leveraging the concept of 'complex sparsity' from machine learning. To implement this idea for social scientific questions, however, it is necessary to develop a new inferential procedure as existing methods cannot quantify uncertainty nor estimate non-linear models without approximations. This paper addresses this by deriving a new Bayesian representation of complex sparsity by combining the generalized and group LASSOs. For fast inference, I derive a novel EM estimation procedure that is guaranteed to converge to a posterior mode. The paper re-analyses two existing papers. One focuses on youth turnout and shows how leveraging geographic heterogeneity allows for more robust fixed effects to be included; the other shows that including varying coefficients across time and space moderates the relationship between segregation and public goods.

2019	83011	198	A New Algorithm for Flexible Multiple Imputation: Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets to Impute Missing Values	During the last years multiple imputation became part of the standard statistical toolbox of political scientists. The advantages of multiple imputation over listwise deletion are clear and widely acknowledged. Furthermore, the introduction of special purpose software for Multiple Imputation like Amelia II or mi has made it easier as ever before to create multiply imputed data sets. However, the assumptions behind these approaches are sometimes forgotten. This is unfortunate since both approaches only provide valid imputations if the assumptions hold. This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets to political science as a more flexible alternative to the state-of-the-art. The new algorithm draws imputed values from arbitrary complex joint distributions of the observed data. With the main advantage over existing approaches that a researcher needs no prior knowledge about the functional forms or structural relationships in the data. I show that it can efficiently impute values in cross-sectional data as well as time-series cross-sectional data and provides significantly better imputations than current approaches.

2019	84801	363	Estimating a Counter-Factual with Uncertainty through Gaussian Process Projection	Estimating a counter-factual in which a treatment did not occur allows political science researchers to better understand the effect of an intervention. The most prominent attempt in the literature is the synthetic control method, but this has important drawbacks. First, by not controlling for post-treatment variables, a degree of precision is lost in the estimator. By estimating what the post-treatment variables would be absent treatment we can regain some of the efficiency of the estimator. Second, by only including as donor units those that have similar trends, we are losing valuable information. Finally, the synthetic control method does not lend well to estimates of uncertainty, making traditional hypothesis testing ad hoc. I develop a new method, Gaussian process projection, that circumvents these issues, and as such performs better than other methods in terms of bias and efficiency, and produces an estimate of uncertainty of the projected unit absent the treatment. We can estimate the causal effect of an intervention, and by using the measure of uncertainty, we can determine how unlikely the difference would be due to chance.	David Carlson	NA
2019	86114	776	Profiling Compliers and Non-compliers for Instrumental Variable Estimation	Instrumental variable estimation is an essential method for applied researchers across the social sciences who analyze randomized control trials marred by non-compliance or leverage partially exogenous variation in the treatment in observational studies. The potential outcomes framework has proven particularly popular to motivate the assumptions underlying the identification of the local average treatment effect (LATE), and the stratification of the sample into compliers and non-compliers. However, applied research is paying little attention to the characteristics of compliers and non-compliers. This neglect is problematic, since profiling compliers and non-compliers is necessary to understand what subpopulation the researcher is making inferences about, and an important first step to discuss the external validity (or lack thereof) of the LATE. In this article, we discuss the assumptions necessary for profiling, which are subset of the assumptions needed for identification of the LATE. We provide a simple method to characterize compliers, always- and never-takers in terms of their covariates and easy to use software that implements our estimator.

2019	85269	434	Testing for Spillover Effects in Cross-Sectional Studies: A Cautionary Tale	Distinguishing substantively meaningful spillover effects from correlated residuals is of great importance in cross-sectional studies as both forms of spatial dependence not only hold different implications for the choice of an estimator but also for the validity of inferences. Empirically, a prominent strategy is to estimate a spatial Durbin model and use either of the asymptotically equivalent likelihood ratio, Lagrange multiplier, or Wald test to scrutinize the non-linear common factor restrictions implied by pure error dependence. While previous research reveals important disparities in the test statistics' finite sample behaviors, the Wald test's sensitivity to algebraically equivalent alternative formulations of the null hypothesis receives scant attention in the context of cross-sectional analyses. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations, I investigate the performance of the Wald test under different expressions of the null hypothesis. As the results illustrate, the alternative formulations produce different test statistics and, at times, conflicting conclusions in small to medium sized samples. By implication, researchers need to exercise caution when using the Wald test to discriminate between substantive and residual dependence and should habitually perform robustness tests.

2019	86557	1123	The Unequal Reach of Transnational Legal Institutions: Mapping, Predicting and Explaining Spatial Disparities in EU Law Use	We investigate spatial disparities in the use of supranational law using a new dataset collecting the geographic coordinates of the entire universe of courts that have passed on cases to the European Court of Justice over the lifetime of the EU. We adopt a data-driven approach which integrates exploration, prediction and explanation into a single research design. Our cartography reveals that involvement in the preliminary ruling procedure tends to be concentrated in a relatively small subset of regions within member states. Next, applying machine learning methods, we find that the presence of organizations like peak courts and infrastructures like large cargo ports constitute strong predictors of EU law use. So too are capital cities and indicators of economic prosperity. Finally, we rationalize these findings using text mining and additional empirical tests. We argue that spatial variations are induced by the team structure of the EU court system and the division of labour within national judiciaries as well as by the resources and geographic location of litigants.

2019	86594	1155	What to do when your neighbors are missing: Missing data and imputation in spatial models	Common wisdom holds that one should never impute the dependent variable. Yet does this reasoning hold in spatial contexts? In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine how different forms of missingness in the dependent variable affect models that include a spatial lag of the dependent variable. We show that since listwise deletion also occurs in specifying the spatial weights matrix, under certain scenarios users should indeed impute their dependent variable in order to gain more accurate inferences from their model. We show the usefulness of this approach through several applied examples.	Brett Bessen, Andrew Philips	NA
2019	84539	330	Discriminating between Issue Voting Rules in Multiparty Elections Using Finite Mixture Modeling	How do citizens of democratic polities translate their policy preferences into voting choices? Proximity and directional theories of issue voting offer different answers to this question that have strong implications for parties' strategies. Controlled scenarios in imaginary two-candidate contests recently gained popularity as a method to identify proximity and directional voters. However, they are not always applicable in comparative research on electoral behavior where scholars often have to study multiparty elections with observational data. In the present paper, I propose a method of probabilistically discriminating between issue voting rules based on finite mixture modeling. Using a paradigmatic case in the proximity--directional debate, I demonstrate that the mixture model describes observed voting choices better than the alternatives. I also show how mixture modeling can be used to study individual-level characteristics of proximity and directional voters. The proposed method can be applied to study issue voting rules from the comparative perspective.	Kirill Zhirkov	NA
2019	84381	295	A Bayesian approach to modeling public opinion trends (applied to the Eurobarometer)	Long-running survey programs provide researchers with valuable time series of aggregate public opinion. However, they also pose challenges, as the data are typically unbalanced in terms of which indicators are available, for which geographical units, at a given time point. The Eurobarometer is a case in point: This survey has covered up to 38 different countries or territories, roughly twice per year for nearly 50 years, with a large number of indicators related to citizens' views of the European Union (EU). The availability of the indicators varies widely: There is no time point at which all indicators are available for all countries, and there is no indicator available for all time points. This paper presents a new database collecting nearly all publicly available Eurobarometer data related to the EU. It overcomes the indicator availability issue by developing two Bayesian state space models to estimate latent trends of support. The most advanced version entails an ordered-probit Dirichlet-multinomial IRT model that accounts for heteroskedastic overdispersion.	Jørgen Bølstad	NA
2019	84984	393	Systematic measurement error in 'soft systems'	The representational account of measurement, while acceptable for some political variables (population, GDP), is inadequate for some of the core conceptual variables of political science (democracy, the power of a state). Measurement of 'soft systems' (Finkelstein 2005) requires an account that goes beyond the establishment of a homomorphism between the real line and a fully observable world. A 'soft systems' account of measurement changes the nature and management of measurement error, and this change is particularly evident when it comes to systematic, as opposed to random, measurement error. This paper introduces (to political science) the concept of 'soft systems' measurement, derives the implications for the analysis of systematic measurement error and statistical analysis, and finally discusses measurement error as equivalent to a chronic disease that must be managed.

2019	85347	461	A Mixture Framework for Scaling with Anchoring Items	If respondents use survey scales differently, their answers are not directly comparable. To increase comparability, responses are sometimes scaled using anchoring items. Such scaling assumes that the responses to the anchoring items are informative on the heterogeneity in scale use. This assumption is not always met in practice. This paper presents a flexible framework that abandons this assumption, in order to diagnose issues with anchoring items and produce better re-scaling by identifying and weighting down non-informative responses. The framework is based on finite mixtures, and rests on sorting the responses into informative and non-informative ones. The informative responses belong to the measurement model of interest and the non-informative ones to a contamination model. The paper presents four contamination models: (1) mid-point inflation, (2) inflation at unknown points, (3) respondent-specific inflation point, and (4) answers driven by a concept other than the one of interest.

2019	86425	1011	Estimating preferences of European Union legislators: A dynamic scaling model for comparable positions in the Council and the Parliament	I provide a novel method for estimating positions of members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that are on the same scale as national party positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys. The positions are dynamically estimated and, therefore, comparable over time. I generate left-right preference data for all individual MEPs as well as all member state governments in the Council for the period from 1994 to 2014. The data is well suited for testing theories of bicameral decision-making in the European Union. I scale roll-calls in the European Parliament using a Bayesian IRT model. The scale is anchored by exploiting national party positions from the expert surveys as bridge observations. Re-elected legislators are used as bridge observations across legislative terms. In addition, I include contextual information and estimates form a commonly used scaling model – NOMINATE – as covariates. The estimates have high face validity and the model generates sensible estimates even when the quality of the underlying roll-call data is low.	Philipp Broniecki	NA
2019	84472	320	A Bayesian method for aggregating evidence from diverse statistical models	The gold standard for evidence is an empirical result which is consistent across multiple studies, may these be independently conducted or replications of original findings. Current aggregation approaches in the social scientist’s toolbox, most prominently meta-analysis and Bayesian updating, combine individual effect estimates and come with the drastic shortcoming that they can only be applied if homogeneous statistical models sharing a common functional form are underlying all studies of interest. This limits their applicability since social and political researchers typically tackle research problems using diverse statistical models. We suggest a Bayesian method that allows to aggregate independent and replication findings even if stemming from different design choices, statistical models, and types of estimates. We achieve this by combining evidence for hypotheses rather than effect sizes. Substantive expectations are first translated into informative hypotheses that go far beyond the NHST framework and evidence for these is aggregated over studies by updating their prior and posterior model probabilities. Next to introducing our method, we evaluate its performance using statistical simulation, and demonstrate its application on an empirical example using original software.	Lion Behrens	NA
2019	84905	378	Estimating the Probability of an Effect: Why Bayesian Posteriors Are Practically More Informative than p-Values	Posterior probability distributions estimated by Bayesian inference are more useful than p-values or associated confidence intervals in Frequentist statistics, in assessing the uncertainty of statistically estimated effects. Neither p-value nor confidence interval allows us to make an intuitive interpretation; they have also led us to choose a specific threshold to make a binary choice, determining the presence of evidence for an estimated effect or the lack thereof. The posterior probability distribution overcomes these problems. It allows us to calculate the probability of an estimated effect exceeding a certain effect size – not necessarily the null value – given our prior belief; the probability as a continuous measure of uncertainty does not compel us to make a binary choice. The first property equips political scientists with a way to communicate their findings with non-specialists such as policymakers more intuitively and informatively; the second property helps the discipline to overcome the publication bias of p<5% and promote a more nuanced debate. I illustrate the utility of the posterior probability distribution using Monte Carlo simulations and one replication study.	Akisato Suzuki	NA
2019	86603	1161	Hypothesis Testing with Compositional Dependent Variables in Cross-Section and Time-Series in Political Science	Compositional dependent variable models are increasingly being adopted in political science as there is growing recognition that failing to account for interdependence among categories may lead to bias. To address these concerns, the most common approaches to test hypotheses rely on seeming unrelated regressions using log-ratio transformations of compositional dependent variables. However, empirical practice has devoted limited attention to the challenges we face in interpreting hypothesis results in these models. In this paper, I first review how these specifications address bias and efficiency concerns in both cross-section and dynamic settings. I then focus on replicating recent studies that have employed these modeling specifications to illustrate some of the potential pitfalls that can be encountered in hypothesis testing and interpretation.

2019	85973	689	On Estimating Predicted Probabilities in Binary Outcome Panel Models	Dummy variable maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for binary response panel models suffers from an incidental parameter problem, making it inconsistent in the number of groups. The standard response to this problem is a conditional ML that removes group-specific effects. While conditional ML consistently estimates the coefficients on time-varying covariates, it makes predicted probabilities impossible to compute. In response to this problem multiple approaches for computing these effects have emerged. However, there is little guidance as to when one solution may be preferred to another. In this paper, I address this question by considering two approaches: Penalized-ML (PML) and Correlated Random Effects. With few within-group observations the CRE is overwhelmingly preferred, but as the number of within-group observations increases, so does the PML's performance. In larger datasets, the differences between these approaches is negligible, but computation time increases. I solve this problem by providing R code for a sparse PML.	Casey Crisman-Cox	NA
2019	86055	730	Detecting long-term media effects on affective polarization: Evidence from web-tracking and longitudinal surveys in three countries	Most work on media and polarization comes from the US, a two-party system, and examines (affective) polarization as a result of self-reported media use or individual online activities, without accounting for the broader communication and information ecosystem. Further, few studies capture continued changes in public opinions as an outcome of accumulated exposure. This project relies on 3-country (U.S., Netherlands, and Poland) 4-wave panel study that that combines longitudinal surveys with behavioral trace data on respondents’ actual online activities from their browsing history. We discuss (1) affective polarization in three countries, presenting its (a) “traditional” and (b) new indicators, and (c) comparing the extent of party-, ideology-, and issue-based affective polarization. We also present (2) the effects of (a) actual exposure to online news (i.e., browsing history), (b) self-reported use of numerous country-specific sources (TV, radio, newspapers), as well as (c) self-reported communication with interpersonal, online, and hybrid networks in terms of frequency and homophily. In short, we offer a systematic causal model of the effects of media use on affective polarization in naturalistic settings and among large samples of the general population in three countries.

2019	86240	871	Exposure to populist online communication: A cross-country study combining web tracking and surveys	In recent academic and public debates, the rise of populism has been related to digital media, as they allow populist actors to bypass the mainstream media and directly reach citizens. However, because of measurement issues it remains unclear (1) whether there is significant exposure to populist online communication, (2) how exposure is related to individual-level variables and (3) whether the political context matters. We address these questions by combining surveys and observational web tracking data for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.S. This original data allows us to precisely measure and link online media exposure to individual-level attributes, political behavior and attitudes. For each country, we identify populist communication by compiling domains attributed to populist politicians and parties and labeling populist communication in the most visited political URLs. Tracking participants' browsing behavior over several months and surveys conducted before and after the 2019 European Parliament election campaign allow us to describe the prevalence of exposure to populist online communication and test hypotheses on its individual-level antecedents across countries.

2019	86146	800	The Effect of Hate Speech Regulation on Preference Falsification	In a world that is becoming increasingly diverse and digitally connected, hate speech has grown into a concern across the globe. Yet, the debate over hate speech rests on untested claims about the effectiveness and consequences of regulatory intervention. We present a pre-registered study to test two hypotheses on preference falsification as unintended consequence of hate speech regulation. Using two double list experiments embedded in nationally representative online panels in the US and Germany, we identify true preferences on a controversial topic and on freedom of expression. We contrast these to directly reported preferences, where half of the respondents are randomly treated with a fictitious hate speech law. This allows us to see, if respondents show a greater difference between what they truly believe and what they say they believe about a protected social group, when faced with sanction for hate speech. In addition, we are able to test whether hate speech regulation results in a chilling effect on public discourse. This effect would be particularly harmful for democracy, which rests on the free debate of policy options.	Richard Traunmueller	NA
2019	86121	782	How Do We Evaluate the “Health of Conversations” on Social Media? Four Metrics for Twitter	Social media companies are facing increasing scrutiny regarding the damaging effects of communication on their platforms. From political polarization to the spread of misinformation, from incivility to hate speech, critics lament the proliferation of serious harms. However, to date, both the scholarly community and the companies themselves have lacked tools for systematically measuring and assessing whether and to what extent harmful dynamics are unfolding across conversations on social media. This paper reports on a new project working to develop four such metrics for Twitter: mutual recognition, diversity of perspectives, incivility, and intolerance. Using a mixture of automated and semi-automated computational techniques, the project is devising measures that will allow a broad-based view of what perspectives are being shared on a given political topic on Twitter, how those perspectives are placed in dialogue with one another, and the extent to which anti-normative (uncivil) and intolerant messages impact conversations. The project also involves a series of Twitter user experiments designed to provide context for and interpret the metrics—that is, to help us understand what actually constitutes a “healthy conversation”.

2019	87960	1253	Divide and conquer: Why politicians tolerate incivility and how polarization widens their audience?	Why do politicians tolerate incivility in social media interactions with the electorate? Why do they use more polarizing language? We argue that both questions can be answered in a uniform way; politicians post polarized Tweets to grab attention and they benefit from the incivility they induce. We empirically show this patterns using crowdsourced measures of both polarization and incivility across the US and the UK and our statistical models show that incivility in public commentary today induces polarization tomorrow and this pattern is beneficial for political users of the platform. We discuss the implications of both polarization and incivility for democratic discourse.	Spyros Kosmidis	NA
2019	86277	896	Public Representations of “Europe” and Economic Policy-Making in Times of Crisis. A Lexical Assessment of News in France, Spain, and the UK (2008-2014)”	This paper analyses how the mainstream newspapers of France, Spain, and the UK presented the European Union and European member states to their national publics during the last economic crisis. It also inquires how they presented austerity policies, and whether these policies were debated. Using an original dataset, I apply a quantitative lexical analysis to a random sample of 800 articles published by 15 newspapers between 2008 and 2014. The dataset presents a strong lexical convergence among the three countries. There is an overwhelming amount of economic and financial terms, and no significant mentions to any other social or political subject. They hardly ever identify a specific person or institution. They use extremely vague words to refer to the EU, but are not particularly negative. These findings contradict the expectation of divergent media discourses related to different national contexts. The hegemonic discourse presents no options to austerity policy-making and no debates on its social consequences. No information helps to trace political responsibilities. The excess of economic jargon does not facilitate the comprehension of technical issues for the general public.	Sabina Monza	NA
2019	80847	109	The F(r)ame of Terror: a Multimodal Analysis of Terrorism Discourse in BBC News Media.	Terrorism has drastically changed in recent years, with the rise of what has been termed “lone-wolf terrorism” in Western countries reflecting a search for a new vocabulary. This paper applies framing theory and combines computerised-content analysis with discourse analysis to explore how the BBC News frames terrorism through both its visual and textual channels. It analyses 750 articles reporting the 14 recent vehicle-ramming terrorist attacks that occurred in Europe and North America between July 2016 and April 2018. Indeed, news stories do not simply present a description of facts, but through a system of organised signifying elements, play a key role in (re)constructing reality. The way news media represents the reality of terrorism has direct consequences on the nature of counter-terrorist policies, shapes the way terrorism manifests in the future and is one of the current main causes of social discrimination against Muslims and Islamophobia. Overall, this study sheds light onto how both language and images subtly represent and construct terrorist acts in specific ways, highlighting a need to develop more rigorous and exhaustive guidelines to report such events.

2019	84233	277	Semi-automated Content Analysis of Media Frames	Framing analysis is one of the most often used approaches in Political Communication and media studies, yet applications of framing analysis using automated content analysis methods have been rare. One of the reasons is that frames are an abstract variable, notoriously hard to identify and code in manual content analysis, which makes automatic classification difficult as well. To overcome this issue, I propose a supervised learning approach to content analysis of media frames. The procedure first codes frame elements, based on Entman’s (1993) definition, in a training sample before using supervised machine learning algorithms to reproduce the classification on a larger data set. In contrast to other approaches, media frames are identified after the coding by clustering elements into groups. The approach improves reliability and validity of frame detection as well as text classification. In contrast to fully automated approaches, like for example topic models, this gives the researcher full control over what is important for category building. To test the approach, I analyse newspaper articles about protest and demonstrations, published in eight major UK national newspapers from 1992-2017.	Johannes Gruber	NA
2019	82243	157	The Ocean of Possible Truth: Drivers and Consequences of News Accuracy Judgements Online	In complex modern societies, citizens have to rely on others to report the facts about politics. Yet given the abundance of low-quality information on the Internet, how do citizens judge the accuracy of news they read online? Previous scholarship suggests that people process new information in terms of congruence with their attitudes, and that they give credit to professional sources. To test how attitudinal congruence and source professionalism determine judgements of news on social media, and how new information affects attitudes, I ran an online survey experiment (N = 418) during the 2017 German election campaign. Subjects were randomly assigned to constructed news item and indicated whether they believed it, across several topics. The findings suggest a strong impact of attitudinal congruence, with no source effect for most topics; only for one topic, subjects gave credit to the professional source. This is bad news for media organisations active on social media. However, the experimental evidence for attitude shifts caused by new information was limited, which qualifies fears about the effects of disinformation.	Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg	NA
2019	85198	415	The Newsroom Dilemma. Media Competition, Speed and the Quality of Journalism	We model how competing media outlets resolve the speed-accuracy trade-off when investigating rumours in the presence of pre-emption risk and reputational concerns. We first derive the counter-intuitive ''better right than first' separating equilibrium where only the higher quality firm does investigative journalism. While conventional wisdom highlights that more competition for the same scoop necessarily drives media outlets towards early release of less accurate information, we show that competition can also increase the range of parameters where separation happens, in equilibrium. Intuitively, competition gives to the reader additional learning tools, increasing the potential reputational gains. Second, we show that an improvement in the quality of the first rumour may make the readers worse off. These observations help us understand the effects of technological advancements have on the quality of journalistic reporting and, as a consequence, on the political and economic choices of the public.

2019	85729	553	An efficient method to identify sources of false information on the internet	The spread of false information, or “fake news”, originated from state-sponsored sources has been recognized as a serious political issue facing Europe by the policy makers and academics in recent years. Several fact checking mechanisms has been proposed by IT and media companies to tackle this problem, it appears that verification of pieces of information is very difficult as the “truth” is often uncertain. An alternative approach is identifying sources of false information, but no comprehensive list is available. This paper proposes an efficient “snowballing” method to identify such sources using a commercial search engine API and high-performance document similarity computation tools that the author has developed as open-source software. Using the novel method, the author identified satellite websites that spread information resembles to Russian’s state-run sources such as RT, TASS and Sputnik News, which are created or used primarily as “anchors” that facilitate spread of false information on the social media platforms. The author argues that identifying and monitoring those satellites websites is an effective way to tackle online propaganda not only by Russia but extremist groups.	Kohei Watanabe	NA
2019	85824	601	Determinants of news selection during European Parliament election campaigns: a conjoint analysis	European elections are still considered second-order with respect to party competition, media attention and voter interest despite the increase in politicization of European politics. This paper studies what kind of media messages are selected by the audience during European election campaigns. It puts forward several hypotheses that tap respondents’ characteristics (e.g., interest in EU politics, political attitudes, media trust) as well as message characteristics (e.g., personalization, negativity, type of news outlet). To test the hypotheses, a survey experiment will be conducted with 1,500 German respondents with Research Now/SSI in spring 2019. The survey will include moderating variables at the level of the respondents before they are being randomly exposed to various pairs of news headlines. The latter vary on several aspects which are randomized internally. Respondents will be asked to choose one news article out of two, six times in a row, which they would be able to read later (the debriefing will explain this deception). The results will be analysed by conjoint analysis and have important implications for scholars working on campaigning effects in Europe and beyond.	Katjana Gattermann	NA
2019	86290	905	Gender Bias in Media Coverage of Election Campaigns	This paper compares how male and female candidates are covered by newspapers during election campaigns. Previous studies have found that the media portray men and women quite similarly, but they have tended to use relatively selective sources and to focus on the amount of coverage and its tone, but not on on its content. We aim to improve on the understanding of this phenomenon by focusing on the Swiss national elections 2015, relying on an almost comprehensive sample of news items covering most of the duration of the campaign, including about 275,000 documents from 91 sources, covering over 3,000 male and female candidates. First, we examine how much attention male and female candidates receive in the media. Second, we consider how the sentiment of coverage co-varies with mentions of male or female candidates. Third, we use topic models to identify how the themes of newspaper coverage and how the candidates' gender is linked to both the topics and the language used to discuss them. Results show how newspapers covered male and female candidates during an important national election campaign.	Fabrizio Gilardi	NA
2019	86033	714	Analysis of Facebook political communities in 2016 Taiwanese General Election	How do political ideology, party support and electoral district affect the structure of online conversations taking place during election campaigns? I investigate this question through a study of Taiwanese politics, which is notoriously divided into the Pan-blue and Pan-green coalitions, and which has also been marked by vigorous use of Facebook for online campaigning. I collected more than 6,000,000 comments on over 10,000 posts from the public Facebook pages of six presidential candidates and 289 legislative candidates in the 30 days leading up to the 2016 Taiwanese general election. I created bipartite networks for politician and normal users. Hypothesizing that the networks of comments are not limited by electoral districts and instead exhibit segregated partisan structures, I apply network clustering algorithms and community detection methods to reciprocal commenting. I also analyze the URLs on candidates’ pages to identify whether coalition affiliation affects the information sources shared by candidates.	Xiaodong Zhang	NA
2019	86103	769	Polarization across Linguistic Boundaries: Online Debate about Japanese Whaling	Research on social media and politics has tended to adopt a domestic focus, concentrating especially on ideological or party polarization, or else to investigate English-language communication on global issues such as climate change. Less attention has been paid to the ways in which online communication on polarized issues crosses linguistic and cultural borders. Is such communication divided primarily by viewpoint or by language? How do information and arguments flow between the domestic and the international levels? And what are state and non-state actors’ communication strategies in linguistically divided policy debates? This study addresses these questions through a quantitative analysis of online debate over Japan’s whaling policy. I assemble a dataset of whaling-related tweets sent since September 2018 (and thus covering the IWC meeting where Japan’s proposal to resume commercial whaling was rejected, and the May 2019 CITES meeting where a backlash against Japan is expected). I use manual coding and supervised machine learning to classify tweets regarding their position on whaling. I also perform a network analysis of follower relationships and the news sources linked to by users.	Jonathan Lewis	NA
2019	78526	76	‘Fighting Fascists in 280 Characters or Less’ – The Unite the Right Rally and the Twitter Response	On Friday August 11, 2017 groups from the American far-right descended upon Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park. Heralding it the Unite the Right Rally, protestors brandished firearms and torches as they walked through the streets shouting racist and homophobic chants over two days. A state of emergency ensued as violence spread, eventually turning deadly after James Fields Jr. drove into a crowd of counter-protestors, injuring scores and killing Heather Heyer, a 32 year-old Charlottesville resident. The proposed paper is a content analysis of the public response on Twitter to the Charlottesville riots. Analyzing responses to tweets made on August 11 and 12 by activists on the ground – namely Richard Spencer, one of the rally’s organizers, and Charlottesville resident Emily Gorcenski – this paper seeks to illustrate the important civil society dialogue occurring on Twitter, alongside the utility of social media content analysis as a valuable means of real-time public opinion measurement and the increasingly important role social media has in contemporary political events.

2019	86199	842	Biased representation of politicians in search results	Web search engines have become an important source when people seek political information and they are generally trusted. At the same time, research on the social identity theory and gender roles reveal that information about political candidates in both traditional and new media can provide gender stereotypical content. In turn, this can lead to the activation of gendered concepts that impacts the evaluation of candidates. However, only little is known about gender biased information about political candidates in search engines, which function as information gatekeeper in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques, this study examines whether search engines autocomplete suggestions for members of the German Bundestag differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender of the politician and explores if the search engine representation of politicians changes over time. The study further compares gender differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from the search engines.

2019	87081	1236	Recovering the French Party Space from Twitter Data	This study explores the possibility to retrieve information on partisan polarization from data generated by online social media users. The specific application that we pursue consists in placing a sample of over 1,000 French politicians on a unidimensional left-right scale by using their followers on Twitter as a proxy for their relative ideological positions. The methodology that we use to that end closely replicates that of Barberá ('Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data,' Political Analysis, 2015), who developed a Bayesian Spatial Following model to retrieve such ideal point estimates in the United States and in five European countries. Our results concur with existing measures of the French party space, and yield additional insights into the behaviour of ideologically extreme social media users.	François Briatte, Ewen Gallic	NA
2019	86544	1111	Digital Inequality among Political Representatives: The role of personal skills and constituency characteristics	The aim of this paper is to analyze the digital inequality among political representatives. The wide penetration of the internet among the population, prompts political representatives to use the internet for political purposes. The existing research, mainly studying the digital divide among the political candidates, demonstrates that there are significant inequalities among the candidates in using the internet for political campaigning. However, literature analyzing digital inequality among elected representatives is still lacking. This paper fills the literature gap and provides deeper understanding of the origins of digital inequalities among elected representatives. Based on original data collection through the Panel of Elected Representatives in Norway (PER), which includes representatives in Norway at all the levels of political representation and by means of a multilevel analysis, I am investigating the role of personal internet skills, socio-demographic and political variables, and constituency characteristics as factors that influence the digital inequality among elected representatives. Building on the literature on online campaigning and offline political representation, I argue that digital inequality appears more commonly among with female, older, more senior, less educated and minority representatives.

2019	86166	816	Defeating Gender Inequalities? Exploring the Impact of #metoo in the News Media Discourse in Australia	Twitter gave momentum to #metoo, as it provided a direct channel for women’s voices to be heard. This was amplified by increased media attention, raising public awareness with detailed accounts of sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace. In Australia, the Human Rights Commission revised the legal framework of sexual harassment, but many still doubt the success of #metoo in the country (Cave 2018). Against this background, we take the concept of politicisation (de Wilde 2011) as a point of departure and investigate how the #metoo debate impacted public discourses on gender equality issues in Australia. We assess a total of two years of media coverage in the country’s largest newspapers, situating the beginning of #metoo in the middle of our period of analysis (November 2016-November 2018). Methodologically, we rely on (1) a small-scale manual claims analysis performed on a systematic random sample of articles, complemented by (2) an automated content analysis of all articles regarding salience, polarisation and expansion of actors. Results are discussed with reference to real-life changes that have occurred in the Australian political landscape.	Elena Escalante Block, Olga Eisele	NA
2019	85312	449	A Survey Experiment on the Effects of Emotional News Frames on Public Attitude towards Climate Change	While the role of media coverage on public opinion towards climate change is acknowledged, the literature has not considered the effect of different emotions conveyed in media messages on attitudes towards climate change policies. We use an experimental framework to test for the effects of three emotions (anger, anxiety, and hope) on attitudes towards climate change policies and willingness to act for the environment in the context of Turkey. Turkey is an interesting case as despite a lack of political discourse on climate security, public opinion survey results show a relatively high level of perceived threat of climate change. This study reports the findings of the pilot survey conducted among a student sample in April and May 2018. While there is some support for the effects of anger and anxiety on support for government policies, we do not find messages carrying hope emotions to influence individual willingness to change behaviour or join collective acts to save the environment. This may be because of high levels of political interest and consciousness about environmental issues among the sample in our study.	Gizem Melek	NA
2019	85443	488	Negativity Biases in Responsiveness to Media Content and Political Ideology Across 17 Countries	There is a considerable body of work, across the social sciences, suggesting negativity biases in human attentiveness and decision-making. Recent work suggests that individual variation in negativity biases is correlated with political ideology (Oxley et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2011; Dodd et al. 2012; Renshon et al. 2015; Osmundsen et al. 2017; Arceneaux et al. 2018): persons who have stronger physiological reactions to threatening or disgusting stimuli are prone to hold more conservative attitudes. But such results have been encountered in the US. Does the link between negativity bias and political ideology apply elsewhere? We answer this question with the most extensive cross-national psychophysiological study to date. Respondents across 17 countries and all continents were exposed to positive/negative televised news reports, and disgusting /threatening /neutral / positive images. Sensors tracked heart rate and skin conductance. A survey captured ideology with a left-right scale, a Wilson-Patterson scale, and partisanship. Analyses performed at three levels of aggregation – respondent-as-a-case, stimuli-as-a-case, and second-by-second time series – suggest some complexity in the link between negativity biases and political ideology.

2019	85920	663	Reporting on Trump: Do Trump tweets embedded in news articles influence public opinion?	Twitter is undoubtedly the main channel of communication for US President Trump and an important source of news for journalists reporting on the Presidency. In a previous article (Ross & Dumitrescu 2018, forthcoming in New Media and Society) we showed that including tweets from ordinary people in in a public policy news article has a sizable effect on readers’ perceptions of the public opinion on the policy. In this paper we rely on two connected experiments to investigate the effects of the modality of reporting Trump’s opinions in journalist-produced news articles. Participants (strong and moderate Republicans and Democrats) read one of three versions of an article about Trump, including either: (1) Trump’s original tweets as embedded in the article, (2) the text of his tweets in quotation marks, or (3) a summary of his tweets by the journalist. We find that Tweets embedded in the article had a marked effect on the type and strength of emotions reported while reading the article, as well as on estimates of opinion changes among the opposite ideological group.

2019	86528	1097	Mobilizing Hate: Moral Emotional Content and Popular Support for Violence in Online Media	When does information mobilize people to support or participate in violence? Despite the proliferation of “fake news” aimed at galvanizing public outrage against certain individuals and outgroups, there is little research on how content translates into individual support for violent and discriminatory behavior. This study explores the link between online content, moral outrage, and support for violence against individuals and outgroups. We hypothesize that moral-emotional frames that sensationalize transgressive behavior provoke outrage against targeted individuals and outgroups, in turn increasing individuals’ propensity to use or support violent and hateful expression against them. We approach this hypothesis using a survey experiment as well as a big data analysis of populations of articles and comments taken from a wide range of media sources. We find that outgroup cues, sensationalized framing of transgressions, and peer support for violence increases individuals' support for punitive violence against individuals and outgroups. Our findings contribute to our understanding of how political and social actors can use online content to mobilize support for violence and discriminatory policies; and has important policy implications for the debate on content moderation.

2019	86538	1105	Mapping drivers of political interaction on Twitter	Analyzing more than twenty million tweets collected during the German Federal Elections of 2017, I identify user- and content-specific variables that can explain spread and popularity of certain political news on Twitter. Affective intelligence theory is used to structure the research process and dictionary-based sentiment classification helps to operationalize variables – such as tonality and emotional content of tweets – that are not directly obtainable from Twitter or other sources. Initial findings indicate that tonality of messages, gender of the communicator, presence of a hashtag, reference to a political opponent as well as the size of the follower base are significant determinants of the user engagement for a given political message. Correlating the tonality of messages sent by political actors and respectively received by them, one also comes to additional findings. First of all, language which is emotionally positive is a better predictor of engagement for a given piece of political information. And secondly, more positive posts by political actors also tend to receive more positive replies, albeit with a significant gender bias.	Ayjeren Rozyjumayeva	NA
2019	86320	928	Politicians Tweets and Citizens’ Responses in Brexit Referendum	Politicians use social media for various purposes, including mobilization, persuasion, and discussion. Through the analysis of tweets during the election campaigns, previous research has found that in critical times in politics, politicians tend to avoid engaging in dialogue with other users and to prefer uni-directional communication, such as mobilization, because of the fear of facing uncivil responses. This may not be surprising as their political careers are at stake in elections. However, less is known about other politically intense periods. Using all tweets related to the Brexit Referendum during its campaign period, we analyze one of such occasions. In particular, we explore the motivations of using Twitter in the referendum campaign by Members of the UK Parliament and Members of the European Parliament. We conduct content analysis to categorize tweets by politicians from two schemes. The first is the aforementioned purposes of social media communication such as mobilization and discussion. The second is the frames in a tweet toward the subject of the tweets. Also, we analyze the patterns of citizens’ responses in tweets to the politicians.	Akitaka Matsuo	NA
2019	85861	624	Parties' use of online political microtargeting: evidence from 10,000 tailored advertisements gathered during national elections in Austria, Germany, Italy and Sweden	This paper seeks to be the first to identify how European parties are actually using social media to implement online political microtargeting (OPM) strategies. In this sense, beyond describing the proportion of OPM for all online advertisements, I shine some light on how do they use it in campaign. To that end, I create a typology of OPM from a party strategy point of view that drive the paper to hypothesize: (i) messages will be more precise at the micro-level than at the macro-level. (ii), stealth advertisers are more present in microtargeted communications than in macro-level style messages and, also, (iii) more used for positive campaigning than for negative campaigning. Thus, I exploit an unique database of political ads in first order campaigns in four European countries –German 2017 Federal Elections, Austrian 2017 Legislative Elections, Italian 2018 General Elections and Swedish 2018 General Elections–. Results not only suggest that European parties indeed use OPM in a strategic manner but also advance implications for research disciplines such political communication, party strategy or data protection.

2019	79640	87	Learning from likes: Party responsiveness to social media reactions	Social media has opened up new ways for parties to be responsive to voters. While parties used to rely on their membership or population surveys, social media enables them to learn about voters’ issue priorities in real-time. The speed of interaction on social media provides parties with instantaneous feedback and thus allows them to adapt their campaign messages with hardly any delay. Even so, there is very little empirical work on whether and how parties make use of these new possibilities. To close this gap, we use a unique data set covering every Facebook post by parties and party leaders in the run-up to the Austrian parliamentary election in 2017, including user reactions. We test the hypothesis that parties are more likely to double down on issues that have previously generated higher levels of user engagement. We also differentiate between different types of reactions (positive vs. negative, clicking vs. commenting). Our analysis thus provides one of the first analyses of party responsiveness on social media.	Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik	NA
2019	85007	398	How Feedback on Twitter Incentivizes Politicians to Conform to Gender Stereotypes	Male and female politicians talk about different policy topics. These gender differences in issue attention are often attributed to preferences or to specialization within parties. Using insights from cognitive psychology and economic sociology, we propose a new explanation focusing on the demand side: the expectations of voters. We argue that citizens approve more of political messages that are congruent with socially relevant characteristic of the politician such as their gender. This approval in turn can reinforce gender stereotypical topic choices as politicians adjust their policy platform to cater to voters. To investigate our claim, we collect data from the Twitter accounts of all Spanish regional and national parliamentarians for six months. We first construct, for each tweet, a measure of gender congruence using machine learning methods. We then show that gender congruent tweets receive more feedback using a model with politician and day fixed effects. Furthermore, politicians react to this by sending more gender congruent tweets. Feeding this into a simulation, we demonstrate that the feedback can lead to a widening gap between the messages of male and female politicians.	Aina Gallego	NA
2019	80613	105	Dimensions of Electronic Political Engagement: New Media, Old Media, and Public Opinion in Russia’s Contested Election Season of 2011-12	How does new media usage influence political attitudes in low information environments? Optimists argue that the internet can serve as a democratizing force in non-democratic regimes by promoting political information, communication, and organization for oppositional forces. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support these claims. Using data from four large Russian surveys conducted over the course of recent elections (November 2011-March 2012), the most contentious period in Russian politics since the early 1990s, we disentangle the concept of electronic political engagement and its impact on political attitudes. We identify five distinctive dimensions of electronic political engagement: web-based political information seeking, web-based political communication, traditional news source usage, and two forms of social networking. However, we find only a limited impact of web-based communication on oppositional viewpoints. These results suggest that electronic political engagement is a complicated, multi-dimensional concept that must be empirically separated. Furthermore, our results throw doubt upon the claim that the internet drives opposition by providing alternative sources of information to government-controlled media.

2019	82874	187	Independent Media in Autocracies	Contemporary autocrats allow independent TV channels and newspapers. Yet, we know little about whether, or how, opposition media influence news coverage in state-controlled outlets in autocracies. Do opposition media constrain autocrats, dampening their ability to inject pro-regime bias into news reporting? Or, does the presence of alternative narratives in independent outlets – and even competition for audience time and attention – encourage state media to adopt an even more pro-regime narrative? Leveraging evidence from contemporary Russia, we explore how the launch and abrupt closure of Russia’s most prominent opposition outlet, TV Rain, influenced news coverage in state-controlled outlets. For the empirical analysis, we produced original data on the volume and tone of economic coverage in Russia, by examining more than 200,000 news stories and combining these with monthly indicators of economic performance. We believe this to be the first study to use rigorously collected data on opposition media in order to test hypotheses about the impact of independent outlets on news framing in autocracies. Findings add to recent studies of media manipulation and speak to the broader literature on authoritarian endurance.	Katerina Tertytchnaya	NA
2019	84278	280	How Perceptions of Information Gap Shapes Censorship Tolerance: Experimental Evidence in China	Why would many authoritarian citizens tolerate the government’s censorship? In contrast to the conventional wisdom that more censorship generates more incentives to seek information, this study delineates a paradox: the more perceived information gap, the more likely people appear to be willing to tolerate the internet censorship. We investigate the mechanism through three experimental studies in China. We show that when a vast information gap and harsh restriction is perceived, participants tend to think current internet censorship as being less problematic and more legitimate. We suggest that system justification motivations might explain people’s tendency to tolerate censorship. If the public mainly recognizes the legitimacy of the existing political system, they are motivated to think of their status quo of processing the distorted and limited information resources as tolerable. However, this regularity is conditional: if people lose confidence in the current system, the system justification motivations might not work. Our findings shed light on the complex interaction between political legitimacy and the government’s information manipulation in shaping popular attitudes towards freedom of the press in China and beyond.

2019	86071	742	Social-Psychological Dynamics of Online Political Contention in High-Risk Contexts: A Survey Experiment in Russia	Mobilization potential of aggrieved citizens via digital platforms threaten authoritarian regimes’ hold on power, and this often results in the placement of state-sponsored constraints upon online political behavior. Although scholars have examined an array of concerning repressive strategies in terms of motivations, means, and outcomes, the tension between citizens’ desire to engage in online political contention and the use of government repression is understudied in regard to authoritarian contexts. Through a web-based survey experiment conducted in the Russian context, we examine the social-psychological dynamics of online political contention in the face of risk and uncertainty. Focusing on citizen experiences from a risk and decision-making perspective, we investigate how the salience of norms that relate to political expression via social media influences affective and cognitive components of perceived risk, and the extent to which these components affect individuals’ intention for engaging in the behavior. We discuss the importance of adopting a citizen-centric framework for understanding political activism in authoritarian settings and future directions for research.	Aysenur Dal	NA
2019	86031	712	Constructing a rhetorical framework for analysing Twitter users' attitudes towards social media blocklists (submitted for the proposed panel examining the application of a mixed set of quantitative and qualitative methods for the study of mediated political discourse on Twitter)	Understanding the cultures within Twitter and deconstructing how users interpret specific affordances of the social network requires methods that capture the nuances of exchanges and the sometimes-histrionic elements at play. This paper describes an approach to explore such content and patterns of discourse through a combination of inductive, retroductive, and deductive manual coding conducted over five stages. The case uses a rhetorical analysis – comprising thematic orientation, message stance, and performative elements – to construct a framework capturing the spectrum of how Twitter users discuss the @Repeal_Shield blocklist’s presence in the 2018 Irish abortion referendum debate. Taking this rhetorical approach allowed for an analysis of how blocklists are understood and debated, depending on users’ own positions and values, in a way that approaches focused solely on structured data elements may not be able to infer. Yet this method, while more interpretive, still requires a systematic approach that goes beyond the observation of themes and patterns. As part of the proposed panel, the application of this method will be discussed using a hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership.	Dawn Wheatley	NA
2019	85866	628	Contextualising hashtag-based publics for political discourse analysis on Twitter (submitted for the proposed panel examining the application of a mixed set of quantitative and qualitative methods for the study of mediated political discourse on Twitter)	This paper addresses a frequently noted - often poorly defined - caveat in the literature concerning representativeness of hashtag-based discourse. Hashtags present a viable and accessible means for the collection of deliberately marked contributions to a particular subject of discourse, though researchers acknowledge that the extent of representativeness of such tweets to the wider discussion of a topic is often unknown and subject to usage practices, user behaviours, and community conventions, arising within and without the medium. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, this work examines the practices of inclusion of hashtags in the case studies of Ireland’s 2015 and 2018 referenda on marriage and abortion, respectively. The findings provide a set of insights about the determining factors of hashtag inclusion (and thus the limitations of the representativeness of such tweets to the wider topical discourse), which are in large part generalisable to other studies and may usefully inform research design imperatives for similar investigations. As part of the proposed panel indicated, the application of these findings to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership will be discussed.	Dónal Mulligan	NA
2019	85949	673	A Theoretical Foundation and Practical Methodology for Situating Political Participation in Mediated Public Discourse (submitted for the proposed panel examining the application of a mixed set of quantitative and qualitative methods for the study of mediated political discourse on Twitter)	This paper investigates political participation in mediated public discourse as the negotiation of identity. Participation is approached as a motivated discursive construct, in which identity manifests through semantic regularities. I ask if identity language can provide endogenous indicators of the contingencies of participation. The cases studies are discourse of 2018 US elections in Michigan and Ohio, though these methods apply to diverse cases of identity speech online. The Twitter timelines of 20,000 politically interested and localised users are assembled into a corpus of 250 million words plus transactional metadata. From the corpus, local collaborators prepare subcorpora representative of common understandings of Left/Right speech, which are used to train a latent semantic classifier. The classifier measures identity language in the full corpus to provide a longitudinal, network perspective. Enriching the dataset with demographic and electoral data will allow comparison of endogenous indicators with established predictors of participation, and provide insight into the question of participation as identity. In the proposed panel, I will discuss the mapping technique as applied to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership.	J. Clark Powers	NA
2019	86068	740	Monitoring cross platform flows and strategic manipulation of political discourse regarding #Irexit (submitted for the proposed panel examining the application of a mixed set of quantitative and qualitative methods for the study of mediated political discourse on Twitter)	Twitter’s features are exploited by a range of actors to promote political causes and ideologies. Digital political mobilisations can originate on alternative social platforms where virtual communities of practice develop strategies to implement on Twitter, targeting the platforms elite user base, particularly news media that rely on it as a consistent resource. This paper addresses processes of shaping political discourse on Twitter through a range of sophisticated strategies utilised by operatives to engineer the increased salience of an issue in the public-political agenda and exploit opportunities to reframe issues to align with political agendas. It analyses political mobilisations and the flow of information across social media platforms to deploy on Twitter around the topic of #Irexit. It identifies networked virtual communities of practice on other social platforms, a range of strategies employed by political activists and outlines a systematic preparatory process to identify potential explanatory variables that shape what and how discourses manifest. The application of these findings to the hypothetical case of a national referendum on EU membership will be discussed as part of the proposed panel indicated.	Niamh Kirk	NA
2019	83400	222	The Effect of the Internet of Contentious Politics in Authoritarian Regimes	What is the effect of the spread of the internet on contentious politics in authoritarian regimes? On the one hand, the Internet allows such governments tighten their grip on power and repress opposition groups. On the other hand, the Internet allows these groups to self-organize. We argue that at a low Internet penetration rate, opposition groups are more likely to mobilize and express their dissent, while with an increase in the internet penetration rate, we are more likely to observe government repressing these groups. We test this argument conducting a meta-analysis across hundreds of sub-national datasets from xSub and using estimates of the Internet penetration from 2006 until 2018. Our findings that underline the curvilinear relationship between repression, dissent and the Internet penetration have important implications for scholars and policymakers interested in the effects of technology, authoritarian regimes, and the relationship between repression and dissent.

2019	83535	229	The Use of Twitter Bots in Russian Political Communication	Abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that authoritarian regimes have recently become increasingly active in their use of social media for disinformation and propaganda via bots and trolls. Previous research has shown that this is particularly true about Russian political Twitter. In this paper, we build on our previous work on bot detection and sentiment analysis of Russian Twitter bots to reverse-engineer the political strategies behind the use of bots for either strengthening or challenging Putin's rule in Russia and his activities abroad. We reveal different types of coordinated bot activity for both pro-regime and anti-regime accounts and show how different types of political events (internal vs. domestic) motivate the use of different bot deployment strategies by both the government and its opponents.

2019	85226	423	Strategic use and disuse of social media in the Syrian conflict	Recent research has highlighted the mobilization potential of social media, which can offer citizens who were previously motivated to hide their true preferences an easier way to share their grievances and find common support. However, it is not clear how these changing dynamics of revealing preferences affect contentious processes beyond initial mobilisation. We argue that in conflict settings, previously shared social media posts indicating political loyalties can pose a severe risk for civilians. For example, anti-regime messages or display of digital support for the opposition may prove to be life-threatening in government controlled areas. Civilians are likely to strategically alter their social media usage with changing local dynamics of conflict. Drawing on the Twitter activity of users inside Syria between 2013 and 2017 we show how the creation of new accounts and the deletion or disuse of old accounts is empirically linked to changes in territorial control by the armed groups operating across Syria. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the risks - and the potential for civilian agency - when using digital communication in civil conflict.	Anita Gohdes	NA
2019	84493	323	Hot Topics: Cyberattacks on News Websites in Competitive Autocracies	Many authoritarian countries censor news websites. One tactic of internet censorship is a so-called Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, a cyberattack that shuts or slows down websites by flooding an internet server with data traffic. Whereas previous studies only explored other methods of online censorship in closed authoritarian countries, there is no systematic study in competitive regimes that are more prone to subtle and low-cost censorship tactics. This study explores the motivation for DoS attacks on news websites in Venezuela. To this end, I have monitored the status of 19 non-state Venezuelan news websites from November 2017 until June 2018 and retrieved their content every day. Using topic models for short text and rare event logit regression models reveal that in particular higher reporting on topics that question the regime's legitimacy and certain economic topics are positively related to a newspaper's likelihood of being attacked.

2019	85380	475	Political Astroturfing in Electoral Campaigns: a comparison between the South Korean and the US presidential election	Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes. Its scope and effectiveness is difficult to assess without a “ground truth” – information that unambiguously identifies participants. We compare two astroturfing campaigns for which we have such information, and which aimed at influencing the 2012 South Korean and the 2016 US presidential elections, respectively. Features that best distinguish the participating accounts from regular users are not their individual characteristics, but patterns of coordination within the campaign, such as tweeting or retweeting similar content at the same time or working regular office hours. We use these empirical regularities to detect additional suspect accounts that are likely part of the campaigns. We analyze the similarities and differences between the two campaign’s online patterns and link them to their internal organization as described in court documents and journalistic investigations. We also compare their respective strategies and their overall effectiveness in influencing public opinion, and find a limited online impact in the South Korean case.	Franziska Keller	NA
2019	85402	479	Election Coverage and Slant in Television News	This paper's goal is to compare equilibrium news coverage during the 2012 US Presidential campaign to a benchmark of socially optimal news coverage. We specify a model where viewer-voters have utility for news stories driven by three considerations: (1) learning information that is relevant for the Presidential election, (2) consuming political news that matches their own ideology, and (3) consuming news for its entertainment or leisure value. News channels choose topic coverage to maximize viewership. We estimate the model using high frequency data on viewership by individuals and topic coverage by news channels, as well as lower frequency polling data.	Gregory Martin	NA
2019	86069	741	New ways to gather trace data: From tracking to takeout	The analysis of online tracking data has become a major promise for understanding the link between (political) media use and citizens' attitudes and behavior. Unfortunately, their collection is becoming increasingly difficult. Few years ago, most web browsing took place in a browser on a desktop or laptop, using the unsecure HTTP protocol. However, nowadays, encrypted HTTPS traffic, mobile phones, and closed apps took over. In the proposed contribution, we give an overview of technical, legal, and ethical possibilities and challenges. In particular, we propose a method to leverage the new GDPR rules, that give every user the right to request their data collected by a company. This means that people who sync their mobile devices with their desktop browser (which on many devices is enabled) effectively transmit their data to Google, Apple, or Mozilla. Having respondents use the now-mandatory takeout function and developing a method that allows them to transmit a sanitized, relevant subset of these data to researchers may be an excellent way to tackle the technical, legal, and ethical issues associated with alternative ways to gather tracking data.

2019	86363	961	How Nudges Can (De)polarize America: A Field Experiment on the Effects of Online Media Exposure	Increasing media fragmentation and algorithmic personalization have led to persistent concerns about “echo chambers” and “filter bubbles” in online information consumption, which some fear could be a cause of increasing polarization in the mass public. However, well-known difficulties with self-selection bias are potentially more severe online, where people can nearly costlessly opt in to (or opt out of) countless news and opinion sources. To address these issues, we designed a pre-registered, randomized field experiment embedded in a nationally representative online panel survey (N = 1,500) in which we encouraged subsets to temporarily alter features of their information environment to make partisan media choices more salient. We then followed up weeks later with post-treatment questions on attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. Using linked data on respondents’ web visits, we are able to precisely measure the treatment effect among compliers and gauge the extent to which their information-seeking habits were altered over time. Our results shed light on the power of relatively small “nudges” in online choice architecture to affect people’s media consumption behavior as well as longstanding attitudes and beliefs.

2019	86392	984	Political Fragmentation in the Digital Domain: Evidence from a Structural Topic Modelling Approach in France, Germany and the UK.	In this paper, we investigate how topic overlaps between media outlets and political actors can be used to measure levels of fragmentation across lines of political difference in the digital domain. To this end, we use a structural topic model (STM) to analyze over seventy million tweets collected during the 2017 National elections in France, Germany and the UK. First, we show the robustness of our choice of topics by means of endogenous measures (semantic coherence, exclusivity) and external validations (topic relations, stability of semantic space). Then, we investigate the extent to which politicians and outlets talk about such topics over time (i.e. topic ownership). Further, STM allows us to determine how often a word is used within each topic by each political actor and outlet (i.e. topic alignment). Preliminary results for the UK show that politicians and media outlets tend to tweet about the same topics, yet they differ in the words they use. Specifically, they refer to politicians they are ideologically close to, and express concerns that are consistent with their own beliefs.	Laia Castro	NA
2019	86413	1000	How Does the Media Environment Affect Readership? Evidence from an App Selective Trial in Italy	Most research on news diets focuses on the increase in personalization of news feeds. I contrast this emphasis with evidence that the online media environment has shifted significantly in content and I posit that this shift may have important consequences for voters' behavior that can only minimally be offset by users selection. To test this theory I deploy a news aggregator app in which content is randomized among different categories of news, such as soft and hard, to understand how the mix of news impinges on voters demand for news, readership and knowledge. I design a selective trial in in which part of the subject pool is allowed to self-select into treatment, while the rest is exogenously assigned different media diets. The results show that the effect on different news diet is consistent across soft-news and hard-news lovers, meaning that readership is only minimally affected by individual tastes. These results provide new evidence of the effects of the media environment on news diets with implications for democratic competence.	Alessandro Vecchiato	NA
2019	86208	848	Estimating the Opinion of Religious Minority Groups Using Bayesian Multilevel Models with Poststratification	Growing religious diversity and the increased visibility of religious minorities affect all European democracies and pose formidable challenges to the social and political life in these societies. Despite its public relevance, we know very little about the social integration and political behavior of small religious groups. Severe data limitations hamper scientific progress in the study of religious diversity: survey data on religious minority groups tends to be sparse and religious minorities are notoriously hard to reach populations. We propose to apply Multilevel Regression with Poststratification (MRP) to cross-national survey data in order to estimate attitudes of religious minorities over time and across countries. We externally validate this method by using MRP to predict political trust of Muslims in the United Kingdom (UK) based on cross-national survey data and subsequently compare the estimates to results from large-sample national surveys conducted in the UK. The ability to estimate attitudes of small religious groups from openly available cross-national datasets can lay the ground for a better-informed discussion on integration of religious minorities into European societies.

2019	85138	407	Measuring Time Preferences in Large Surveys	Solving dynamic policy problems requires investments that generate payoffs in the future and as such may be discounted because they are later or because they are more uncertain. To understand political support for future-oriented policies, it is therefore critical to separately identify the importance of time and risk preferences. The most widespread methods to elicit individual-level time and risk preferences tend to conflate these two forces. A recently proposed solution relies on a costly lab-experimental method, convex time budgets (CTB). We develop, validate, and present a simplified and affordable version of the CTB method for implementation in large surveys. We find that employing hypothetical decisions yields measures of time preferences with nearly identical distributions. However, the theoretically preferred CTB time preference measures correlate only weakly with the most widespread alternative approaches for mass surveys, the staircase method and self-assessment. Finally, we present evidence that the importance of time preferences for predicting support for a variety of future-oriented policies is weaker than is often claimed in studies that rely on stated time preferences.

2019	86460	1038	Can Strengthening Self-Integrity Improve Measurement Accuracy of Sensitive Survey Items? Evidence from Survey Experiments on Self-Affirmation and Contextualisation	Direct survey measures of sensitive beliefs and behaviours often result in biased estimates. Impression management concerns of respondents vis-à-vis enumerators are generally invoked to explain the observed misreporting. Yet, even in self-administered, anonymous surveys, completed in private, such bias remains. An explanation may be that respondents are unable to admit to themselves that they hold socially unacceptable beliefs, or have engaged in socially undesirable behaviour. This paper investigates whether misreporting of electoral turnout, a well-established sensitive survey item, in online surveys can be reduced by strengthening and buffering a respondent’s self-integrity against the perceived psychological threat of admitting to having not voted. Drawing on evidence from survey experiments and accompanying vote validation studies run after the 2016 UK EU referendum, we find that neither a self-affirmation exercise nor contextualisation of the turnout question significantly improves reporting accuracy. This suggests that sensitivity bias in anonymous online surveys is unlikely to be due to self-admission concerns. Our findings also highlight the limits of self-affirmation exercises and point towards satisficing as a source of measurement error.	Patrick Kuhn, Samuel Mellish, Nick Vivyan	NA
2019	86540	1107	Publishing with Sensitive Data: Balancing Replication and Privacy Concerns Using Synthetic Data	Political scientists pervasively use data that contains sensitive information--e.g. micro-level data about individuals. However, researchers face a dilemma: while data has to be publicly available to make research reproducible, information about individuals needs to be protected. Synthetic copies of original data can address this concern, because ideally they contain all relevant statistical characteristics without disclosing private information. But generating synthetic data that captures--eventually undiscovered--statistical relationships is challenging. Moreover, it so far remains unsolved to fully control the amount of information disclosed during this process. We address both challenges using Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), a class of algorithms that excels at generating synthetic copies from undefined, empirical distributions. Our proposed bayesian, differentially-private implementation has two important advantages: it explores distributions without human involvement and allows researchers to control the trade-off between data privacy and information disclosure. We offer experimental evidence that GANs generate appropriate synthetic data even for complex, multimodal data generating processes. We further show that the approach produces unbiased synthetic data at privacy levels that can be flexibly selected ex-ante.	Christian Arnold	NA
2019	86766	1208	Varying Dimensionalities in Spatial Representations of Public Opinion	Responses in public opinion surveys are often aggregated into a representation in a lower dimensional political space. Most applications jointly scale respondents in a single common space. However, these applications also often highlight that such scaling exercises are better suited for some than for others – the individual responses of some are more in line with underlying dimensions than those of others. This phenomenon could be a consequence of varying dimensionalities across respondents – while the responses of some may be structured by a single dimension, those of others may be structured by multiple latent dimensions. I extend established multidimensional IRT models to allow such heterogeneity via a latent mixture model. Doing so allows the analysis of which respondents move in less and which in more complex political spaces. Importantly, the results underline that public opinion should be considered not as a single space for all, but as a mixture of political spaces.	Garret Binding	NA
2019	85219	419	Who's to blame: Populist Right-Wing and mainstream parties' roles in adoption of welfare chauvinist policies	Literature has devoted significant effort to determined RRWPs’ position on welfare state. There is a consensus that, by 1990, most of those parties abandoned the right-wing position regarding distributive issues and embraced a welfare state defense. However, this position differs from traditional left-wing parties and usually combines nativism, authoritarianism and populism. Accordingly, studies have confirmed that welfare chauvinism is an important element of RRWPs’ attitude in the social policy domain. Not surprisingly, quantitative analyses have found positive relationship between RRWPs’ government participation and the adoption of restrictions on immigrants’ entitlement to social rights. Nevertheless, qualitative studies suggest that the translation of RRWPs’ policy preferences in policy outputs is more complex. Literature has pointed the role of institutions, RRWPs’ bargain power, and mainstream parties’ policy position to explain changes on immigrants’ access to welfare state. Therefore, this piece aims to disentangle the relation between RRWPs’ government participation and the adoption of welfare chauvinist policies. It relies on an in-depth study of Austrian and Danish cases.	Juliana Chueri	NA
2019	85246	428	Falling Behind the Competition or Restless in the Class: A Longitudinal Assessment of Worries over Immigration in Germany and Risk Inequalities	Are workers exposed to higher unemployment risk increases feel more negatively towards immigrants? Is this effect of falling behind distinct from social class? One of the areas into which inequalities have taken a strong hold has been the volatility of jobs under risk. However, much of the immigration attitudes literature have struggled to conceptualise and study the effect of a labour market competition effect on attitudes. To remedy the shortcomings of the previous work, I investigate how worries stemming from falling behind and the effect of social class distinctly translate into immigration attitudes. The paper contributes to what we know about attitude formation and risk by, first, presenting an original theorisation of economic risk with an objective comparison point and dynamic element. Second, I study the causal effects of worker’s status by presenting evidence from the 1999-2015 waves of the German Socio-economic Panel and juxtaposing the variance in relative risk exposures of an individual compared to the rest of the national labour market and the stability of social class over time.

2019	86258	882	Immigrants’ policy preferences in a comparative view: The role of integration policies and economic conditions in shaping attitudinal convergence	Large and increasing shares of foreign populations and the expansion of suffrage to non-nationals in a variety of European democracies contain the potential of shifting the socio-political landscape in Europe. However, so far, only few studies outside of the U.S. context address the political preferences of immigrants and how they differ from natives. In particular, little attention has been given to the role of macro-factors in explaining differences of immigrants’ policy preferences across host countries. This paper seeks to address these existing gaps in the literature by looking into the role of integration policies and economic conditions in explaining cross-country variations of differences in political attitudes between immigrants and natives. Using European Social Survey data (2002-2016) in 16 European countries, I hypothesize that better economic conditions and liberal integration policies in the host country reduce attitudinal gaps between immigrants and natives. Generating an overview of attitudes encompassing simultaneously economic, cultural and immigration-specific issues, I suggest that immigrants’ political integration is not only shaped by individual factors, but that also structural policies influence how political preferences of immigrants converge towards natives.

2019	80913	112	Banning the Veil: The Effect of Religious Clothing Restrictions on Attitudes towards Muslims and Immigrants in Europe	Recently, many European countries have passed policies restricting face covering garments. Many see these laws as targeting Muslim women. This study examines the effect these policies have on public attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants. We argue these laws affect public attitudes in two ways. First, following research that suggests that public policy outputs influence public opinion and attitudes, we argue that laws restricting face coverings signal to the public that Muslims are members of a social out-group, leading the public in these countries to become more negative towards Muslims and immigrants, generally. Second, we theorize that these effects diffuse across borders. When a country adopts restrictions on face coverings, the publics in neighboring countries also become more negative towards Muslims. To test these propositions, we draw on Pew and Eurobarmeter public opinion data to measure public affect towards Muslims and immigrants across 15 EU countries from 2009-2016. The results provide a deeper understanding of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe, as well as a greater knowledge of the effect of governmental policy outputs on public opinion and attitudes.

2019	82923	190	Learning about Polarizing Facts: Politically Motivated Learning and the Asylum Seeker Debate in Germany	Societies in Western Europe have become increasingly polarized on immigration and asylum policies. In this study, we investigate how people process new information on asylum seekers through a novel survey experiment that disentangles politically motivated learning, rational learning and motivated responding. First, we implement a covariance detection task, as recently developed by Kahan et al. (2017), on the topic of asylum seekers: Respondents are asked to interpret a 2x2 table about the relationship between asylum seekers and crime rates. Crucially, respondents are randomly allocated to evaluate a conclusion that triggers their identity-protective stakes or not. This design allows us to disentangle politically motivated learning from other forms of learning. Second, we extend this design by testing for motivated responding. We randomly provide respondents with incentives and different response-formats to motivate them to report their inference truthfully. This design element aims at disentangling whether respondents learn in a politically motivated fashion or whether they learn correctly yet give answers that are congenial to pre-existing beliefs. Our research has important implications for research on polarization, political psychology, but also survey methodology.	Konstantin Glinitzer, Markus Wagner	NA
2019	86605	1163	Gender Differences in Education in OECD Countries	This paper will explore in detail the gender differences in attainment (education completion) and achievement (as measured by standardized test such as PISA and TIMMS) in the extended set of OECD countries (OECD plus a number of other developed countries). The paper will use the extensive data bases provided by the OECD, specifically through the use of OECD.stat. Of specific importance will be the variation in attainment and achievement gender differences in reading and math and the relationships between the two variables. The standard results of such studies worldwide indicate that girls outperform boys in reading, literacy and writing skills, while the reverse is true for math and science. We first explore if this is still correct in the most recent OECD results and then analyze the covariance of the two variables by country. We specifically analyze countries where the inverse correlations are not present; i.e. those countries where girls seem to outperform or equally perform boys in both or neither subjects. The OECD data sets provide a full set of country-level data to help explain the varying differences.	John Witte	NA
2019	86269	892	Paying for what you get:Does information on cost implications affect public support for government policies to promote emission-reducing technologies?	Governments frequently enact policies to either encourage or discourage the use of particular technologies. E.g., governments have adopted climate policy measures to discourage the use of fossil fuels, promote renewables, and associated technologies, such as low emission vehicles. We focus on policies promoting electric vehicles, which is politically very contentious as it deeply affects citizens’ private sphere. Specifically, we study whether and how public support for these government policies changes when citizens receive information about the financing of such policies, notably for costly voluntary pull measures. Based on the theory of budgetary illusion, we argue that public support is likely to drop. This arguments is tested based on a conjoint experiment fielded to a unique random sample of 4000 conventional car and 1500 electric car holders in Switzerland. The main finding is that policy support does in fact decrease when cost implications are communicated. Surprisingly, however, this does not hold true for pull measures that are not supported when financing is not mentioned. This hints towards a cost anticipation for disliked policies while costs are ignored when policies are supported.	Gracia Brückmann	NA
2019	81146	116	Simplifying pension decisions	Financial illiteracy is a widespread problem that can have substantial impact on pensions decisions – which are themselves complex and can have life changing consequences (cf. Lusardi & Mitchelli2007). In private and semi-private pension systems such as the one in Chile, individuals can tailor their pension modes to their needs – four diﬀerent pension schemes, multiple providers, guaranteed periods, among others. However, this ﬂexibility requires retirees to make a lot of diﬃcult decisions and more than 80% of people end up paying large sums for delegating those choices to a pensions adviser or a sales agent, and still not selecting the alternatives that give them the highest present value (FNE, 2018). We argue that one reason for these ‘selections errors’ is the way information is displayed to individuals and, that by simplifying information, these ‘errors’ can be reduced. To test this hypothesis we conduct an online experiment in which participants (aged 55-70) are incentivized to make decisions on simulated pension offers. The treatments include a Control, three different variations on the metrics used to display information and one change of format.	Denise Laroze	NA
2019	81096	114	Input from Whom? Public Opinion, Tax Reform, and Representation	Most government legislation does not affect citizens equally. Tax reforms, for example, often have a disproportionately large impact on certain taxpayer groups, while only bringing about marginal benefits to the collectivity. At the same time, concrete policy effects (e.g., on a citizen’s pocketbook) coexist alongside varying levels of ideological attachment: some people are clearly more invested in certain policy issues and outcomes than others, even in the absence of a direct personal effect. This observation gives rise to a fundamental question about how democracy should work: should citizens who are disproportionately affected by, or even just especially interested in, a certain policy change be given a disproportionate amount of influence over that reform? This paper examines public opinion on this issue using a national survey experiment fielded in the US. To do so, the study: (1) presents a hypothetical tax reform bill to respondents; (2) varies both the consultation type (none/constituency polling/consulting interested constituents/consulting affected constituents) and the bill’s fate (pass/fail); and (3) compares outcome satisfaction and perceived fairness across the treatment groups.

2019	86235	868	Frames vs. Facts: A field experiment on members of the european parliament	Attention is a pre-condition of public policy debate and implementation. Therefore, it is essential to understand under which conditions political elites pay attention to an issue, and importantly, the role played by the type of information in shaping their attention patterns. Various fields of research from agenda-setting, interest groups, to policy diffusion, show how empirical evidence is key in the policy-process. However, most of this work is based at the macro level, with scarce evidence of how political elites respond to different types of information at the individual level. The aim of this paper is to cover this gap by analysing to what extent empirical information gathers policy-maker attention and response. We use a field experiment on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) embedded in a real-life fundraising campaign. Results suggest that MEPs are significantly less attentive and respond less to information that contains evidence cues rather than that presented as general ideas. Results also suggest that there are no important differences between political groups, and crucially, on being in favour or against a specific policy proposal.	Leire Rincón García	NA
2019	85895	647	Who Supports Equal Employment Polices in the Public Service? Experimental Evidence on the Effect of Public Service Motivation, Political Ideology and Public Sector Affiliation	Equal employment policies (EEP) are a widespread tool to improve representative bureaucracy by supporting applicants from marginalized groups to enter public service. Critics of EEPs argue that these polices undermine the merit principle, which is traditionally at the center of public hiring. We address this debate in two steps: First, we test the effect of Public Service Motivation (PSM) and political ideology on support for specific EEPs (quota, encouragement and self-commitment). Second, we conduct a framing experiment to identify the alleged trade-off between merit recruitment and the representation of migrants in the public service. Evidence from a sample of 1200 subjects (including public and private sector employees, as well as students of public administration) shows the following: First, support for active EEPs increases with PSM and a leftist orientation. Second, support for merit recruitment increases in the trade-off frame. Third, the framing effect is conditioned by subjects’ political ideology. Right-leaning subjects show some significant reactance; as they are overemphasizing merit recruitment in the migrants’ bureaucratic representation frame.	Markus Tepe	NA
2019	86418	1005	Reputation of Public Agencies in the Space of Democracy	Contemporary research argues that reputation, produced by knowledge and expertise, serves as a strategic asset for public agencies, in order to enhance their autonomy. However, widely accepted notions of reputation and autonomy in public administration are under-theorized and ignore democratic contexts. In order to address these shortcomings, this study adds to literature in two ways: Theoretically, it develops a framework, which emphasizes pluralistic values and external evaluation that are fundamental for the study of public administration in the space of democracy. Thus, I argue that reputation ultimately depends on public opinion of the whole democratic audience, rather than on evaluations of specific groups - a view that violates the democratic fundamental “one person, one vote”. Empirically, the paper assesses reputation and autonomy of the European Commission over a 30-year period, relying on perceptions (Eurobarometer) and institutional (publicly available) data, which challenge the conventional one-way causality claimed by former work. In combination the theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that reputation and autonomy’s relationship is not straight-forward and advance conventional definitions by considering fundamental democratic values that are indispensable in public administration.

2019	86693	1200	Welfare State Design and Satisfaction with Democracy in France	Main question that this paper addressed is: To what extent opinions about welfare state design influence French citizens’ satisfaction with democracy? Drawing insights from policy performance theory of Pippa Norris, four hypotheses were developed in which satisfaction with democracy was dependent variable and welfare goals, economic consequences of social benefits, misuse of welfare programs and social protection served as predictor variables. By analyzing data that came from two waves of European Social Survey (ESS 4 and ESS 8) through Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, it was found that social protection was the chief predictor of satisfaction. Moreover, citizens’ level of satisfaction was found to be least dependent on economic consequences of the benefits they receive. In contrast to the quite weak yet positive association between welfare goals and satisfaction; a negative association was observed between satisfaction and misuse of welfare benefits. Various threats and opportunities, that decision-makers can endanger while procuring welfare finances have been outlined towards the conclusion.	Bilal Hassan	NA
2019	84673	344	Information, reflection, and successful job search. A nudging experiment.	When searching for a new job, unemployed young people face several challenges. Especially in times of tight labour markets, the job search motivation is often put to a severe test, as suitable jobs are not easily available. Previous research has shown that receiving information and self-reflection on how to search for a job enhance self-efficacy and search motivation, thereby reducing the duration of unemployment spells. Following up on these results, we conducted a nudging experiment in cooperation with the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs. Our target group comprised of about 37,000 young adults who had recently become unemployed. We designed different treatments containing an info-clip and/or a short online questionnaire. Links to the treatments were sent out by email. At the end of a six-month observation period, we used register data to compare unemployment duration within the treatment groups and the control group. Indeed, we do find significant treatment effects for young unemployed with a low level of formal education. While effect sizes are small, considering the low costs of the intervention, efficiency is very high.	Monika Mühlböck	NA
2019	86066	738	Interest Group Access to the Government: Who Gets It?	Scholars have long been focussed on studying lobbying and potential influence that such activities can have on public policy. The ability to lobby state actors, however, critically depends on having access to them in the first place. While not being sufficient, access is a necessary condition for successful lobbying. So far much of the theoretical and empirical literature has been dedicated to money in politics, while potential mechanisms of acquiring access are usually limited to some form of financial transactions. In this study I focus on the case of the UK, where due to campaign spending limits, the influence of money is, arguably, more limited than in other pluralist systems. I use a new dataset created from government transparency reports for 2010-2017 that comprises some 100’000 contacts between cabinet ministers and interest groups, linked with organisation-level data. I argue that when financial incentives are small, other organisations’ characteristics, such as economic importance, long history of corporate-government relationships and ideological proximity play an important role in acquiring access to decision makers.

2019	85879	637	It’s All About the Money: Scaling Environmental NGOs and their Donors	It has long been recognized that foundation support is a crucial element for NGOs, particularly for those championing the environment. However, exactly how foundations and NGOs match, or whether NGOs tailor their organizations to appeal to foundations, has been understudied. We address these issues by compiling a dataset of foundation support of environmental NGOs and specifying a statistical model of donating using Item Response Theory. Estimating this model using Correspondence Analysis, we find two key spatial dimensions—ideology and focus—and evidence consistent with environmental NGOs moving in space to accommodate foundations do better.

2019	85798	584	Status-quo bias in comparative perspective: Agenda-setting by interest groups and political parties in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands	Where does change come from? Who drives changes to the policy status-quo? The common-sense answer to this question is that government officials, embedded in bureaucratic institutions, defend existing policy programmes, and that actors from society challenge existing policies and demand change. In contrast, various policy studies show that ‘policy creates politics’ and that beneficiaries of particular programs, not always as allies of officials, lobby to maintain existing policies. We examine the empirical plausibility of these competing hypotheses by comparing the party-interest-group-constellations pushing for change on policy issues with those defending it. We also describe the issues in terms of several alternative and mediating factors, most notably, party system (proportional versus majoritarian), public opinion (level of support, level of awareness), party political salience (issue emphasis in party programs) and institutional locus (legislative or other venue). We draw on elite interviews with approximately 400 interest representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands (executed as part of the ‘Agendas and Interest Groups project’).

2019	86474	1049	Bureaucrats as Legislators: The Influence of Independent Regulators on the Liberalisation of the Railways in Europe	Do bureaucratic bodies affect the decisions of elected politicians, and if so, under what conditions? In this paper, I propose that agencies with a stronger institutional capacity – i.e., endowed with more independence and competences – are more likely to influence legislation, and this effect is moderated by the characteristics of the market in which they operate. I develop a spatial model that shows that such agencies are more likely to draw the final legislative output closer to their ideal points. Empirically, I test this argument by looking at the impact of Independent Regulatory Authorities (IRAs) on the liberalisation of the railway industry in Europe, using the institutional capacity of IRAs in other network industries as instrumental variables. By employing computer-based text analysis techniques, I also introduce a novel approach to the estimation of IRAs’ ideal points, thus offering a flexible empirical strategy to measure the ideology of the bureaucracy and its influence on legislative outputs. The findings show that IRAs with stronger institutional capacity that regulate sufficiently liberalised markets are more likely to exert influence over legislation.	Luca Bellodi	NA
2019	86859	1222	Explaining Variation in the Architecture of Social Policy Portfolios: The Interplay of Political Parties and Institutions	The study of the party-policy connection has gathered substantial knowledge on whether some parties are more likely to expand or retrench the welfare state and which strategies their use when engaging in social policy dismantling. By contrast, relatively little is known on how different parties intend to solve societal problems. Are some parties more innovative than others when it comes to use of different social policy instruments? And do some parties tend to prioritize some social issues stronger than others?In this paper, we intend to close this gap by analysis changes in governments’ social policy portfolios over time. In doing so, we propose a novel concept of policy(1) instrument and (2) target equality that allows us to systematically map the policy strategies of left and right wing parties operating in different institutional contexts. The analysis is based on an innovative dataset that covers the social policy portfolios of 13 European countries over a period of 34 years (1980–2013) in the areas of pensions, unemployment, and child benefits.

2019	86612	1168	'Unintended Consequences: EU Funds, Political Corruption, and Power Consolidation'	Do fiscal funds allocated by the European Union (EU) to member states deliver an electoral advantage to corrupt incumbent parties? Current works assessing the link between EU transfers and political corruption focus primarily on the impact of EU funds on recipient states' patterns of political corruption and do not engage with the question of how EU funds interact with political corruption to shape party dynamics in EU’s recipient member-states. In this paper, I take into account the degree of executive corruption across recipient states to examine the impact of EU fiscal allocations on domestic politics and governing parties' electoral outcomes. I propose a novel theory whereby fiscal allocations to corrupt recipient states deliver political latitude that incumbents utilize to advance their electoral outcomes and governing authority. Examining data on EU fiscal allocations over the period of 2000-2015, I find that fiscal transfers to EU member states are correlated with higher electoral margins for incumbents in corrupt countries. I interpret this as suggestive of misallocation of EU transfers by corrupt parties to buffer their political latitude over the opposition. ​	Albana Shehaj	NA
2019	85711	548	Political Alignment of Firms and Employees: the Role of Asset Specificity	When do political preferences of employees align with those of their employers? I argue that in firms with more specific assets the economic interests of employers and employees will be more aligned, as the fate of jobs is tied more closely to the firm. Therefore, individuals working in firms with high asset specificity are more likely to share political preferences with their employers. However, simultaneously observing both company and employee preferences is difficult in practice. I match 1,691,790 campaign contribution filings of 85,109 employees to 874 publicly listed firms using US campaign finance data between 2003 and 2016. I accomplish this by employing natural language processing to automatically identify employers and occupations. Holding constant individual occupation, I find that employees in companies with more specific assets are more aligned with their employer, and that most variation in alignment is at the industry-level. The results confirm long-standing expectations from trade theory about firm structure and political alignment and stress the continuing importance of sector-based models for political preference formation.

2019	84650	339	Party Identification, the Policy Space, and Business Donations to Political Parties	Political finance scholars have paid little attention to the partisan preferences of business donors. This was because business donors were overwhelmingly concerned with the left-right dimension and enjoyed stable relationships with centre-right parties. These parties are increasingly tempted by nationalist positions on a globalisation dimension. This new ideological flux provides an opportunity to measure the extent to which donors are party identifiers or react to changes in the policy space. Dramatic shifts in party policy on both dimensions and a relatively transparent political finance regime make the UK a particularly apposite case to study this question. I analyse 19,000 donations to the Conservative Party and show that business donors reacted strongly to recent shifts on both the left-right and globalisation dimensions. Thus, centre-right parties may not be able to rely on party identification and their left-right position to maintain business funding. Economic nationalism is likely to cost centre-right parties money.	Iain McMenamin	NA
2019	85757	564	What Do Parties’ Statements of Account Tell? A Spatial Approach to Study Party Finance Structures	The funding of political parties is of great significance for elections as well as the functioning of representative democracies. Although the comparative study of party finance structures provides insights into how parties manage money over time, existing studies solely descriptively looked at incomes and expenditures. Assuming that condensed data on finance structures contribute to a better understanding of party organisations, the paper elaborates methodological approaches to effectively capture revenues and expenses. Therefore, I suggest using distance matrices to assess parties’ proximity in terms of incomes and expenses. Principal component analysis and clustering enables to construct a compromised party finance space, making comparative studies feasible. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, I apply the method to German parties between 1995 and 2016 based on public accounting reports. It can be shown that parties’ income and expense strategies diverge towards elections and converge subsequently. In addition to this finance cycle, the analysis finds party finance types. I propose using the method for further comparative studies within and across countries.	Marc S. Jacob	NA
2019	85717	551	Are anti-corruption audits effective? Evidence from Brazilian municipal employees	This paper examines the extent to which anti-corruption audits effectively remove corrupt bureaucrats from office. We analyze the impact of 10 years of randomized anti-corruption audits on the career paths of 2.2 million Brazilian municipal employees. While previous studies show that audits remove corrupt politicians from office, we show that their impact on corrupt bureaucrats is weak. Dismissal and departure rates in municipalities found innocent are comparable to non-audited ones. However, bureaucrats in corrupt municipalities have longer tenure than those non-audited. After an audit, dismissal and departure rates immediately catch-up with those of non-audited municipalities for low-skilled workers. For high-skilled bureaucrats, rates catch up in the next electoral term, if a mayor from opposition wins, suggesting higher removal costs. We develop a new method to estimate the probability of a non-audited municipality to be corrupt. Corrupt bureaucrats may preempt the audits by putting up protections or departing early. We quantify these effects with a career choice model. Results suggest that while anti-corruption campaigns may be effective at removing political kingpins, they are less effective in eliminating their bureaucratic accomplices.	Romain Ferrali	NA
2019	75684	22	The Political Effects of Wealth Inequality:Evidence from a Danish Land Reform	The political effects of wealth inequality remain among the most discussed subjects in modern social science. It is a prevalent viewpoint that wealth inequality leads to political inequality. However, as changes to wealth inequality are often endogenous to other phenomena, the political consequences of wealth concentration are hard to study. In this article, I exploit a Danish land reform of 1919 which by law confiscated 20-25 percent of the net value of historically entailed estates. Exploiting the geographical variation in the density of these estates, using difference-in-difference estimation, I am able to assess the local political effects of this shock to wealth inequality. However, contrary to the argument that economic inequality leads to political inequality, I find no effect on decreases in wealth inequality for local political inequality. Instead, the expansion of the franchise during this period strongly affects political equality and also seems to have limited the power of the estate owners. These results cast doubt on whether wealth inequality actually matters for political equality in the context of widely held political rights and strong rule of law.	Lasse Aaskoven	NA
2019	84876	374	Is skewed unfair? Influence of the structure and the level of income inequalities on redistributive behavior.	Although income inequality has been growing since the 1970s, demands for more redistributive policies have stagnated. While many scholars looked at macroeconomic factors, only a few focused on the cognitive mechanisms behind preferences for redistribution. Previous studies from behavioral and political economists highlighted two crucial factors in shaping redistributive preferences: the perceived fairness of inequalities and the structure of the unequal distribution. Building on this literature, we argue that individuals adjust their expectation of legitimate inequalities to the level of inequalities they are exposed to, while they have a consistent aversion towards positively skewed distribution. We test these propositions using 'spectator/worker' experimental designs. Study 1 (N= 185), analyze the role of the level of inequality and its skewness on redistributive behavior. Our next studies are investigating the interplay between ideology and self-interest on the adjustment and the skew aversion mechanisms. Our approach combines recent theories and methods from behavioral economy, and political sciences and aims at understanding how and when individuals are judging inequalities as fair and how existing inequalities are affecting their behavior and preferences.

2019	86771	1210	Upward Representation Bias: How Voters Sustain Political Inequality	Inequality in representation and responsiveness has been reported widely, but we are only starting to understand why these inequalities might occur. In this contribution, we demonstrate a new source of political inequality: Upward representation bias. Citizens of lower socio-economic status tend to elect politicians with higher socio-economic status even if they know their political views will be less represented in this case. We demonstrate this phenomenon using a candidate choice experiment fielded in probability-based surveys in France, Germany, Iceland, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden (N=17,405). These types of voter biases reinforce existing inequalities even under equal participation. We encourage scholars to further explore ways voter biases affect political inequality.	Dominik Duell	NA
2019	83736	236	What Do Humans Think About Democracy?	Comparative politics has long been interested in average citizens. Using data collected by international survey projects, researchers for decades have examined differences in opinions across countries.We question the utility of this approach for understanding politics in a globalized world. In an era when policy challenges cross borders with ease and geographic boundaries have become less powerful markers of differences across people, the nation-state may no longer be the relevant unit of analysis to understand how people think about democracy. Do humans – rather than Americans, Germans, or Kenyans – actually like it?While the question sounds simple, existing research designs are not equipped to answer it with any precision because of uneven sampling of countries around the world. We turn the conventional model of comparative survey research on its head: starting with the world as the unit of analysis and humans as the relevant population, we develop a new way of analyzing cross-national surveys to gauge public opinion on a global scale. We use data from the World Values Surveys (WVS) to measure and describe human preferences for democracy.	Damien Bol	NA
2019	84867	372	Preferences for Consensus and Majoritarian Democracy: Winners, Losers and Institutional Learning	This paper analyzes individuals’ preferences for a consensus or a majoritarian type of democracy, as captured by whether they believe that single-party governments or coalition governments are best for democracy. We argue that variation in these preferences is a function of both institutional learning and the current and historical vote share of the party respondents vote for. First, we expect that, as a result of institutional learning, individuals living in democracies characterized by coalition governments should be more likely to favor consensus democracy. Conversely, those living in countries characterized by single-party executives should be more likely to favor majoritarian democracy. Second, we expect that this relationship will be moderated by individuals’ party preferences. The relationship between institutional learning and democratic preferences should be stronger for those who support parties that are/have been in government. Since majoritarian systems consistently block small parties, the differences in terms of preferences for coalition vs. single-party governments between the supporters of large and small parties should be larger in majoritarian countries. We test these hypotheses drawing on data from the European Social Survey.	Ferrin Monica, Enrique Hernández	NA
2019	86626	1178	The Meanings of Democracy	While recent research has noted declining public support for democracy as well as a coinciding growth in support for populist right wing political parties throughout the United States and Europe, it has implicitly assumed a shared understanding of democracy across time and space. In this paper, we utilize the World Values Survey, the European Social Survey, and a module of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study to identify the structure of public understandings of democracy. Specifically, we use Latent Class Analysis to identify five unique clusters of public meanings of democracy and to test whether these clusters are consistent across geographic contexts and over time. We conclude by comparing these democratic meanings to political ideology. Overall, we find first that, despite some important differences, understandings of democracy are more similar than different across contexts and over time. Second, public understandings of democracy do not neatly align with ideological placement or party support.	Kirby Goidel	NA
2019	85239	427	How Ordinary Citizens Detect and Evaluate Democratic Regression	In recent years, some democratically elected politicians in Western democracies have attacked and sought to undermine core democratic institutions. In this regard, it is often argued that ordinary citizens will act as a strong bulwark against such developments and protect democracy. However, little is known about the ability of citizens to detect and evaluate such democratic backsliding. In a conjoint experiment with representative samples of 1000 respondents in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Denmark, and Spain, I test citizens’ ability to detect incremental regression on different dimensions of democracy: the fairness of elections (e.g., voter registration, campaign finance, and availability of polling stations), civil liberties (e.g., freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and the media), and the rule of law (e.g., the nomination and independence of judges). Specifically, I present several fictional newspaper articles describing the occurrence of democratic backsliding in the respondents’ home country on these different dimensions of democracy, and asses both whether they are able to detect democratic regression at all, and whether they are more sensitive to some forms of regression than others.

2019	85921	664	Cheap seats vs turnout: who prevails?	Turnout rates substantially differ across districts within countries due to their different social or demographic composition (i.e, urbanization, average wage, employment or elderly population) and local cleavages. However, cross-national research summarizes this distribution with a single number, the national turnout rate. We argue that turnout rate differences across districts makes an important difference for party systems. Grofman et al. (1997) have shown that when turnout rate differences across districts are linked to the partisan vote shares in those districts, certain parties are more likely to have 'cheap seats' vis-à-vis turnout. We expand such argument and using data from the last lower-house election in all democracies in the world, we show that turnout rate differences increase electoral disproportionality and reduce the number of parties. When examining the determinants of turnout rate differences, we find that they are correlated with the degree of political and economic decentralization.	Ferran Martinez i Coma	NA
2019	86491	1063	Employment and female turnout	Most previous evidence on the relation between employment and female turnout is based on correlational studies. While such correlations are illustrative they do not tell us whether employment affects or whether there is some other factor that affects both employment and turnout. We identify the effects of jobs on tUrnout by collaborating with large companies in Ethiopia to randomly assign jobs to female applicants. In the presentation I will present results from the first six month follow up.	Andreas Kotsadam	NA
2019	84556	331	Institutional Determinants of Youth Political Participation in the European Union: a Multilevel Analysis	Institutional context is a significant unexplored factor in shaping levels of youth political participation in Europe. There is little to no research on how democratic maturity together with other country’s characteristics influence political participation, when it comes to a cross-national study across EU countries targeting young people. In this paper, I outline an empirical analysis exploring the effect of institutional factors (e.g. democratic maturity, electoral systems, and corruption) on the propensity of young individuals to engage in formal and informal mode of political participation. The majority of research on institutional factors as determinants of political participation focuses mostly on voting as a political action. Such theoretical and empirical gaps are addressed in my paper. I develop a comparative perspective on youth (dis)engagement in politics and suggest that institutional context matter and fundamentally condition the way young people participate in politics. To assess these claims, I analyse cross-national data over time from the European Social Survey (2002–2016) and an original dataset on institutional-level variables, on youth participation in politics in 13 EU countries by applying multilevel logistic regression.

2019	84440	313	Term Limit Extension and Electoral Participation. Evidence from a Diff-in-Discontinuities Design at the local level in Italy	We study the effect of term limits on voter turnout in local Italian elections. Since 2014 the Italian law allows mayors in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants to re-run for a third term, whereas mayors in cities with a number of residents above the cutoff still face a two-term limit. The introduction of the reform permits us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design exploiting the before/after with the discontinuous policy change. We find that voters negatively react to the introduction of the reform and in particular electoral participation decreases by about 5 percentage points in municipalities eligible to the treatment compared to municipalities in the control group. This negative effect is essentially driven by a decrease in the political competition. We also find that relaxing term limits does not improve the quality of politicians running for election.

2019	86340	945	Habitual Voting in Autocracies: Lessons from the Russian Case	While a large literature studies how participation in free and fair elections shapes long-term political behavior, we know relatively little about the socialization effect of electoral participation in electoral autocracies. Does the act of voting matter in these regimes? Namely, does the nature of electoral competition and regime-sponsored voter mobilization shape “habitual” voting? Using the Russian case, and leveraging evidence from the universe of elections taking place in the country from 1930s onwards, we consider the impact of early-life electoral experiences on citizen life-long voting propensities. To estimate generational turnout differences, we use hierarchical age period cohort analysis and apply semi-parametric generalized additive models to harmonized public opinion survey data spanning over two decades of Russian elections (1991-2012). We compare the mobilizing effects of communist era elections against those of Putin-era elections, in which extensive electoral mobilization has been noted. We also consider sub-national variations in electoral competition using multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP). Findings have implications for understanding the role of authoritarian elections in shaping voter behavior and for understanding habitual voting more generally.	Ksenia Northmore-Ball	NA
2019	85807	589	An Ideological Turing Test: Delegates’ understanding of their ideological opponents	The notion of an ideological divide dominates American politics, but the nature of that divide is less clear. Ideological Americans might disagree sharply, or they might not even understand one another. This paper applies an Ideological Turing Test to delegates at a number of state conventions. The test follows the logic of the Turing Test in computer science. Alan Turing proposed that any true artificial intelligence would be able to fool an interlocutor that it is in fact human. Similarly, we might think that an ideologue who really understands their opponents would be able to fool them into thinking they agree. We thus asked respondents to describe the views of liberals and conservatives on a number of issues, and then presented these open-ended items to acknowledged ideologues, who judged their accuracy.

2019	75567	12	Learning From Polls	Voters' expectations of party strengths are a central part of many foundational political science theories that posit a strategic act by the voter. But how do voters develop these beliefs and how is this belief formation affected by polling reports? In this article, we present a dynamic Bayesian learning model that serves as a baseline for how beliefs are formed. This also allows us to infer how and when belief formation deviates from the theoretical ideal. We validate the model and illustrate its potential based on a number of experiments conducted on MTurk. This allows to identify groups that are less likely to change beliefs when new (and different) information arises.	Lukas Stoetzer	NA
2019	84704	355	Elections as information: evidence from Google Trends	Elections are usually seen as providing information to elites about the preferences of citizens, but they can also provide information to citizens about what other people believe. Hence, elections can serve as important signals of social preferences and norms. For example, the success of a radical right party can provide new and surprising information about other citizens’ preferences. In this paper, we consider when elections act as information mechanisms. To do so, we look at data from Google Trends. Specifically, we consider when citizens search for information on specific political parties in the days after an election. We construct a database of search activity after elections in EU countries since 2000 and match this to data on political parties from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. We show that voters are more likely to look for information on party when it just entered parliament, when it entered the parliament for the first time and when it is more extreme than other parties. These results help us understand when elections stimulate information-seeking, with potential consequences for citizen attitudes.	Markus Wagner	NA
2019	85811	593	Does Message Distortion by Rival Parties Affect Voters?	How do rival parties’ characterization of each other’s policy positions affect voter perceptions of party positions? Parties are engaged in constant exchange with their rivals about their policy positions. This creates possibilities for rival parties to misconstrue each other’s policy message. However, we do not know what effect such misconstruction has on voters. We argue that the effect of such message distortion by rival parties on voters’ perceptions of party positions depends on two factors. First, following the motivated reasoning literature, we argue that partisans pay more attention to their own party messages, and independents are the most malleable group to rival party distortion of party messages. Second, we state that the effect of issue distortion is greatest for less salient issues when voters do not know a lot about parties’ positions. Using original observational data on parties’ campaign rhetoric from 10 European democracies, and survey experiments conducted in the UK, we test these expectations. Our results have important implications for our understanding of party campaign strategies and their voter-level consequences.	Zeynep Somer-Topcu	NA
2019	86711	1203	Belief strength and updating policy positions	How do people update their perceptions of parties’ policy positions? Previous studies find that the mere exposure to and the reception of party policy-related information is not sufficient for updating individuals’ perceptions of party positions, but rather, various characteristics of recipients interact to reinforce and change such perceptions. Among these characteristics, this paper focuses on the role of belief strength. Specifically, we examine whether and how pre-existing self-confidence in the knowledge of the positions of political parties leads to different consequences in updating policy positions. In our original survey experiment with a representative sample of UK citizens, respondents receive different sets of policy (budget) information. More importantly, we measure their belief strength on their placements of themselves and political parties on the ideological and policy dimensions before and after the information treatment. From this survey experiment we aim to find how the role of information in updating party policy positions varies upon the strength of initial beliefs in the perception of party policy positions and, further, to identify different updating patterns of individuals upon their characteristics.

2019	86028	709	Revisiting the Origins of the British Labour Party	How the Labour party displaced the Liberals as the predominant political force on the British left has been the subject of controversy since its occurrence. We revisit this debate, positing that the electoral success of the Labour party in the interwar period required both universal male suffrage and union-led mobilization of voters. We develop this argument in two parts. First, we use ecological inference techniques to estimate the social bases of parties’ support between 1900 and 1935. For this, we create a unique dataset combining information on electoral outcomes, the social class, religious and occupational composition of constituencies, and information on the location and membership of trade unions affiliated to the Labour party. Second, we link information on constituency characteristics with data on the voting behavior of Liberal MPs in Westminster to explain the decision of key trade unions to shift their support from the Liberal party to Labour in the 1900s. Our study not only advances our understanding of British political development, but also enhances our understanding of the forces underlying party system stability and change in general.

2019	82975	195	How Parties Organize from the Grounds: The Genesis of the Movimento 5 Stelle	Challenger parties have fundamentally changed European party systems, societies and policy-making. Yet, existing work was unable to directly investigate how they came into existence in the first place. We focus on the case of the ’Movimento 5 Stelle’ and exploit the party’s unique organizational structure relying on independent local chapters operating publicly on online platforms. From the very beginning, M5S organized its meetings online, which provides a unique opportunity to study how political parties organize from the grounds. We web-scrapped the entire universe of M5S meetings from the first day of its existence, resulting in a geo-coded dataset with more than 200'000 meetings by more than 1'000 local chapters with an average number of 134 members in 896 different locations in Italy. This rich dataset allows unique descriptive insights into the genesis of a successful challenger party. We then match the events with economic and public opinion data to study which factors contribute to their rise and success. Our findings have implications for the study of party organizations and how democracies could be re-organized in the 21st century.	Daniel Bischof	NA
2019	84491	322	The Workers’ Party in Brazil: empirical implications of elite incentives toward the “unbalanced” nationalization of support	Under what conditions does a young political party expand its support across a country and stabilize it over time? Facing the rise of anti-establishment movements in politics around the world, this question seems have increasingly gained its weight in the study of comparative politics. This paper focuses on the rise of the Workers’ Party (PT) and its implications for static and dynamic party nationalization in contemporary Brazil (1986 – 2014). Two testable hypotheses will be drawn. The first hypothesis predicts that, contrary to dominant paradigms in the study of party nationalization, elite incentives to coordinate cross-district or district-specific campaigns should be dependent on the brand image of the party to run legislative candidates. The second hypothesis, thereby, predicts that the more each candidate weights party brands rather than own resources in legislative elections, the more likely the party will achieve the higher degree of static and dynamic nationalization. By estimating the individual and partisan effects of elite incentives on party nationalization with the two-level mixed-effect modelling, this seeks to demonstrate those hypotheses with the Brazilian Legislative Surveys (1990 – 2013).

2019	86100	767	WHO VOTED FOR SOCIALISM? THE RISE OF THE SAP IN SWEDISH LOCAL ELECTIONS, 1910-18	Employing fine-grained, group-level data recorded in local elections between 1910 and 1918, we explore the social and geographical basis of the rise of Swedish social democracy and the overall formation of the Sweden’s 20th century party system. In spite of the electoral reform of 1909, which introduced quasi-universal male suffrage, plural voting continued to be employed in local elections during the 1910s. Voters, who were divided into 40 income grades, received as many ballots as the number of his income grade. Exploiting the published records of electoral behavior by income rank in those elections, we explore the structure of support for social democracy, liberalism and conservatism. Socialist vote was strongly correlated with income rank – but varied across geographical area, as a result of unionization and the nature of associational life.	Zsuzsanna Magyar	NA
2019	86337	942	A change of heart? Partisanship and policy preferences in the context of party formation	It is well-established that policy preferences and party identification influence each another. Yet the relationship between policy preferences and party identification has not been fully examined in the context of party formation. Therefore, we know little about the individual-level mechanisms by which new party entry influences partisan realignment. This article examines the development of party identification with nascent radical right parties and its relationship to preferences towards immigration and European integration. The empirical analysis focuses on the Dutch PVV, the German AfD, and the British UKIP. We make use of long panel data to observe whether changes in issue attitudes cause changes in party identification or vice versa. Preliminary results show that cross-pressured voters who hold anti-immigrant or Eurosceptic attitudes subsequently identify with a radical right party. In contrast, citizens who feel politically alienated develop stronger anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic attitudes only after they identify with a radical right party. By explaining the heterogeneity of voter responses to new party formation, our findings contribute to a general theory of partisan realignment in multiparty democracies.

2019	86965	1227	Institutional Sources of Executive and Legislative Accountability	In separation of powers systems, the success of the president and the legislature in shaping policy varies with the balance of institutional power ascribed to each branch of government. In this paper, I study the extent to which these institutional factors impact individual citizens' evaluation of the work carried out by each branch of government. I reason that individual citizens will evaluate a branch of government controlled by ideologically distant elected officials in a particularly negative way when it possesses the institutional powers necessary to change policy in its preferred direction. Leveraging variation in institutional designs in 11 Latin American democracies and using data from 17 AmericasBarometer surveys, I find that institutional designs affect individual citizens' perceptions of the work conducted by the president and the legislature, which should affect how they punish or reward elected officials for their actions.

2019	86661	1191	Holding mayors accountable? Police brutality and mayoral approval in American cities	Does police performance affect mayoral approval? Do citizens hold mayors accountable when they are dissatisfied with the police? Despite the established body of research on executive approval, little is known about how public opinion on a particular bureaucratic branch - police department in this case - affects mayoral leadership. Past research suggests a positive association between police performance and mayoral approval. However, recent incidents on police violence challenge this straightforward relationship, as mayors tend to distance themselves from police brutality and promise to reform the police department. Using comparable survey data in Chicago and New York, this paper examines the relationship between police performance and mayoral approval. Results find siginificant differences between the two cities: While police performance positively affects mayoral approval in Chicago, it is inversely related in New York City. This divergence, I argue, may stem from the distinct political structure of the two cities and calls for a close look at how institutional differences can influence public opinion at the local level.

2019	84195	274	Open Up or Shut Down? Media Scrutiny and Government Responsiveness During Scandals	How do government institutions respond to media scrutiny in the face of scandals? Do they 'clamp down' on transparency in attempt to minimize negative information becoming public, or do they 'open up' in attempt to bolster their credibility? We answer this question using novel data from the Mexican federal government. We first develop novel measures of media scrutiny and scandal incidence based on a corpus of 350,000 news articles pertaining to 25 Mexican federal ministries, identifying scandals based on bursts of negative media attention. We then evaluate government responsiveness using administrative data on over one million requests for government information over a twelve year period, with their associated responses. For each scandal onset, we can compare not only affected and unaffected ministries both before and after, but also examine information requests that are already 'in the queue' when the scandal begins, offering unique empirical leverage. This research design will offer important new findings on government responsiveness at crucial moments of heightened public interest.	Daniel Berliner	NA
2019	85376	474	Political Fiascos and the Evaluation of Politicians: Quasi-experimental evidence	This paper analyzes how the evaluations of individual politicians are affected by policy failures, and how these failures alter the foundations and heuristics on which individuals rely to evaluate these politicians. Through the implementation of a synthetic control method and an “Unexpected Event During Surveys Design” this study aims to contribute to the debate on whether citizens can single out responsibilities for the failures of individual politicians. The paper draws on extensive data on the evaluation of Spanish Ministers, and it exploits the coincidence of the failure of the Spanish Health Minister to manage a crisis with the fieldwork of a representative survey. Given that the day at which respondent are surveyed is as if-random, this crisis represents a unique opportunity to identify the causal effect of political fiascos on citizens’ attitudes. The results indicate that: (i) policy failures have a strong impact on the evaluation and name recognition of politicians; (ii) citizens are able to single out responsibilities for specific policy failures; (iii) policy failures change the foundations of citizens’ evaluations, who become less likely to rely on heuristics.

2019	86026	707	The Battle of the Public Perception: How First- and Second-level Media-Agenda affected the Public Perception of the EU Migration-crisis	The sudden increase in immigrants crossing the EU external borders in 2015 kicked off political debates about causes, consequences and solutions to what became the EU refugee-crisis. The public perception of immigration being a major issue increased accordingly throughout the member states although some countries were only slightly affected. This study combines newspaper-content from eight EU countries from 2012-2017 with eight waves of cross-national surveys aiming at explaining the effect of newspaper content on the public perception. Focussing on both first- and second-level agenda-setting the effect of the media attention and party frames the results suggest that both volume of media attention to immigration and the actors engaged in the debate had a significant impact on the public perception of the migration crisis and the public preference for imposing additional measures to fight irregular immigration. Further, investigating the moderating effect of left-/right-position reveals that frames supporting tougher immigration had polarising effects, while EU integration frames had depolarising effects.

2019	86078	748	Policy responsibility in the multilevel EU structure – The effect of media reporting on citizens’ responsibility attribution across five policy areas.	In the complex EU multilevel structure, citizens differ in their perceptions of who is responsible for policy outcomes. The media plays a crucial role in providing citizens with relevant information for attributing responsibility. Policy responsibility consists of two concepts, functional and causal responsibility. While the latter has been studied in the context of ‘blaming Europe’ for negative outcomes, the necessary condition of functional responsibility, i.e. the level of actual decision-making power, has received scant attention. Similar to the media’s influence on causal responsibility perceptions, the media should be even more decisive for the neutral perception regarding functional responsibility. We consider the case of the Netherlands using survey data including perceived levels of decision-making power between the European and national level for five policy areas: Immigration, social welfare, economy, terrorism and Europe. We link this with data from an automated media content analysis of major Dutch newspapers and news websites. With regression models we predict the effect of exposure to policy-related information on the European level (as a weighted ratio compared to the national level) on policy-level attribution (incl. controls).

2019	85330	455	Opinion Leadership on Instagram: How Political Leaders’ Posts Influence Followers’ Views and Actions	Candidates and office holders in most countries regularly use Instagram, and millions of users follow the most well-known political figures. But to what degree can politicians’ posts affect the political opinions and actions of their followers? The present study examines the opinion leadership potential of political leaders’ Instagram posts from the theoretical framework of electronic word-of-mouth communication, tie strength, and homophily (Brown & Reingen, 1987; Granovetter, 1973; Valenzuela, Correa, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2017). Opinion leadership is a function of the strength or weakness of leaders’ relationships with followers and the degree to which leaders and followers share similar attributes. A survey of those who follow political leaders on Instagram will measure the influence of leaders’ posts on followers’ political views, and that influence will also be compared with more traditional sources of opinion leadership, such as friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances. The findings will also show which actions leaders’ posts most trigger, such as liking and commenting, and how demographics and political attitudes influence followers’ actions.

2019	87192	1241	The Mechanisms of Protest Recruitment through Social Media Networks	The literature on mobilization has long suggested that social ties have a strong influence in the decision to protest. Previous research does not provide clear evidence for why personal ties play such mobilizing role. In this paper we lay out four main theoretical mechanisms and we test them using real-world protest attendance data: a) they provide basic logistic information vital to protest, b) they create motivations for others to protest, c) they solve coordination problems, and d) they put pressure on others to participate. We collect data on Twitter activity during the 2018 Womens March. We then use geolocated accounts to find a set of users who attended a march and users who did not. We use machine learning techniques to determine the information, motivation, coordination, and pressure messages to which they were exposed. We find users who protested to be more connected among themselves than those who did not. We also find that users who saw a larger number of information and coordination messages were more likely to protest, but find no effect for motivation and pressure.	Andreu Casas, Joshua Tucker	NA
2019	80570	101	Do supporters of populists use digital media differently? Comparing communicative interactions by supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Reddit	The international rise of populism has in part been attributed to digital media. They are seen as allowing populists’ supporters to share and distribute information independent from media organizations or elites and as offering communication spaces in which they can support each other and strengthen communal ties irrespective of their societal standing. This raises the question whether populists’ supporters use digital media differently from other groups, given the importance of digital media for them. This could, for example, find expression in the intensity of digital media use, content of conversations, levels of support and caring expressed by and for community members, degree of incivility directed at outsiders, and mirroring of the “populist communication style” attributed to populist elite communication. We examine this on Reddit by comparing linguistic patterns and content in two subreddits focusing on a populist, Donald Trump, and a center-left politician, Hillary Clinton, during the US-presidential election 2016.

2019	85485	498	You Called Me a Populist! The Media’s Talk of Populism and Its Influence on Public Opinion	Populism has become a popular word in the political debate. However, its meaning and its connotations are unclear. This paper examines the use of the term populism in the Spanish print media and the consequences of a policy or political actor being labelled as populist. Our analyses draw on an original dataset of all newspaper articles containing the words populism and populist and were published between 2013 and 2017. Through a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and the manual coding of a sample of these articles we explore the way in which the term is used, which actors it is associated with, and whether it involves negative or positive connotations. Based on the finding that the term is frequently used in a pejorative way, we conduct two survey experiments to assess the consequences of a policy or actor being labeled as populist. Results show that individuals are less likely to support a policy or political actor when it is labelled as populist and that the effects of the populist label are independent from the use of a populist rhetoric.

2019	86118	780	Against the globalist class: Does the Alternative for Germany borrow from Hitler?	The rise of European radical right parties co-occurs with the 2015 refugee protection crisis and a notable change of tone in immigration debates. Pundits and journalists even alleged that some of the language and images used by radical right parties are reminiscent of pre-WWII fascist politicians’ language. Most prominently Alexander Gauland, leader of the German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), has been accused of having borrowed from Hitler. In this paper, we assess the validity of the accusations by drawing on quantitative text analysis methods. Moreover, we use those analyses to address fundamental questions about the importance of collective memory in the development of contemporary anti-immigrant discourses. We do so by utilizing the full set of Hitler’s speeches between 1925-1933 and the speeches of German politicians in the Bundestag, including Gauland, since 2010. Tracking exclusionary rhetoric and figures of thought from Hitler to contemporary politicians’ speeches, we show which topics have been reintroduced by the AfD. These findings are particularly important in times of rising populism and increasing prevalence of exclusionary attitudes.	Judith Spirig	NA
2019	85374	472	Fighting Euroscepticism: The Impact of EU Institutional Advertising on Support for European Integration	Amidst growing Euroscepticism, European institutions launched an advertising campaign through social media highlighting the benefits of European integration. In this paper we test the effectiveness of these ads in reducing Euroscepticism through an online survey experiment fielded in Spain. Participants in the treatment groups were exposed to some of the ads produced by European institutions. All ads present a positive image of the European integration process. However, while some ads directly emphasized how citizens benefit from this process (e.g. no roaming), others emphasized the reduced costs of European integration. Our findings indicate that all ads significantly increase diffuse support for European integration. However, the effect of the ads emphasizing the benefits of European integration are stronger than those highlighting its reduced costs. Moreover, the analyses indicate that the positive effect of the ads on diffuse support for European integration are mediated by changes in the perception of the costs and benefits of EU integration for one’s own country. In a context of growing Euroscepticism, these findings, based on realistic treatments administered in a realistic environment, have important policy implications.	Enrique Hernández	NA
2019	85601	510	Does where you’re from affect what you say in parliament? The impact of state of origin on senators’ speeches in the Australian Federal Parliament (1901 - 2018)	When Australia federated in 1901, the Senate (upper house) of the Australian Federal Parliament was envisaged as a house to represent the interests of the constituent states. To investigate the efficacy of this we analyse how what is said in the Senate is affected by the state the senator represents and how this has changed over time. We codify two data sources to create a new dataset of who said what in the Australian Federal Parliament between 1901 and 2018. Using the House of Representatives (lower house) as a control, we then analyse politician-specific language using a Bayesian hierarchical model. We explore how the effect of the state that a senator represents changes over time, and hence how the representation of states’ interests has evolved, and how the state-identity of politicians has been subsumed by party-identity in Australia. We find that: the importance of the state-of-origin has decreased over time; and that substantial changes were associated with the world wars. Our findings have implications for how we think about the Senate as either a 'states’ house”, or a “party house”.	Rohan Alexander	NA
2019	83157	207	Changing Places in Parliament	In bicameral systems members of parliament (MPs) may seek to advance careerwise by moving from the lower to the upper chamber. Such moves are especially sought after if the upper chamber has similar powers and is of smaller size. In this paper we present an analysis of members of the Swiss parliament that change their places and how this affects their behavior. While contrary to an often studied parliament like the US Congress the electoral districts do not change for MPs that change from one chamber to another, most Swiss MP that engage in such changes are subject to different electoral rules. We find that these differences affect considerably the behavior of MPs (in terms of voting, activities, etc.) that move from one chamber to another.	Simon Hug	NA
2019	84854	370	Turning the Clock: Manipulation of Legislative Time as a Strategy in Bicameral Bargaining in Germany	To what extent can legislative duration be strategically manipulated in order to maximize a government´s legislative gains in bicameral procedures? Research on bicameral bargaining mainly focuses on the policy effects of legislative grid-lock while research on executive control over parliamentary timing focuses on first chambers. We combine both perspectives to better understand the government’s behavior in bicameral bargaining. Accordingly, the government strategically speeds up parliamentary processes in the first chamber in order to avoid legislative defeat when loss of control over the second chamber becomes likely. Also, it slows down legislative processes once it expects to win control over the second chamber in order to avoid compromise. We compile a novel dataset on 1,645 bills proposed in Germany. Germany´s both symmetric and asymmetric bicameralism provides for a hard test of our argument. Results from survival analysis confirm our expectations. This has major implications for the understanding of political bargaining in bicameral systems. The strategic use of time allows a government to enforce its agenda without relying on institutionalized, visible features to manage legislative conflict.	Christoph Garwe	NA
2019	85905	652	The Influence of the Electoral Cycle on the MP Behaviour in Parliament	Most analyses that are concerned with the interplay of different types of party groups in parliament take their interests as fixed between elections. Institutional and party-specific features, as well as empirical results, however, suggest that party goals might not be stable.To what extent the increasing importance of vote-seeking with approaching elections translates into changes in MP behaviour depends on the institutional context and the position of the party within parliament. These changes have important consequences for the outcome of the parliamentary process if bill proposals might be rejected for strategic reasons at a certain time. Therefore, this paper seeks to systematically investigate how and under which conditions the MP behaviour changes over the legislative term. By analysing full transcripts of all parliamentary speeches on bill proposals from six established democracies over more than twenty years, I can distinguish between institutional country-specific features as well as contextual features within countries. Quantitative text analysis methods such as Wordshoal and sentiment analysis allow me to track party behaviour consistently and infer changes in strategic behaviour over time.	Jan Schwalbach	NA
2019	80849	110	Parliamentary Opposition Behavior and Electoral Outcomes: Does it Matter?	An assumption in legislative studies is that parties and politicians act strategically in the legislature with an eye to their behavior’s effect on their fortunes in subsequent elections. Relatedly, some have linked the contemporary electoral struggles of mainstream parties across established democracies, and the rise of populism, to the existence or increase of policy consensus between the main opposition and the government parties. However, no one has yet tested whether legislative voting, where agreement and conflict between parliamentary groups are most tangible and visible, has a direct effect on electoral outcomes. This paper addresses the question of whether, besides government performance and party campaigns, opposition parties can influence electoral outcomes using strategic legislative voting. We leverage a broad legislative voting dataset from 15 democracies coupled with a detailed account of the opposition’s opportunity structure in each country, to establish to what extent the legislative behavior of opposition parties affects election outcomes. Thereby, the paper tests whether one of the crucial assumptions of political science, namely the connection between parliamentary behavior and electoral considerations, is valid for opposition parties.

2019	86005	697	Multidimensional measures of government (in)stability	We challenge the accepted measures and definitions of governmental instability common in the literature and databases, which are based on governmental durability. We argue that these measures, which rely on the combination of 3 criteria (change in partisan composition; change in the identity of the Prime Minister, and occurrence of general elections) are from some aspects too inclusive (not any change in government's partisan composition signifies instability), and from other aspects too narrow (focusing almost exclusively on a government as a whole). We look at whether broadening the scope of conceptualization of government instability makes a difference and demonstrate that countries might be characterized as unstable from one perspective, yet stable from another. We additionally show that the commonly used definition of governments used to measure government duration inflates instability, at least for some countries. We demonstrate that using more precise definitions of government longevity—ones that do not equate any changes in government's partisan composition as a sign of instability—yield important ramifications for the rank-order of countries' governments' instability.

2019	86171	820	Are Coalition Signals Cheap Talk for Voters?	During election campaigns, parties often announce which coalition they might or might not form after the election. Are these “coalition signals” just cheap talk for voters? If voters take these signals seriously, they should compare the actual coalition behavior of parties during the government formation process with pre-election coalition signals. Voters should then electorally punish parties that deviate from their announced coalition preferences. Employing the 1996 New Zealand election, I investigate the voters’ reaction to a party joining a coalition government that it ruled out during the election campaign. In this election, the party “New Zealand First” clearly signaled that it would not form a coalition with “National” but then did not keep this promise. My quasi-experimental research design exploits the fact that the day on which these two parties announced to form a coalition falls within the fieldwork period of the 1996 New Zealand Election Study. This allows me to make use of a regression discontinuity design. Preliminary results suggest that voters lose trust in parties deviating from their coalition preferences announced prior to the election.	Oke Bahnsen	NA
2019	83924	248	Payoff allocation in coalition governments	How are payoffs distributed in coalition governments? Coalition parties have to come to an agreement on which policies should be implemented during the time of office and on the distribution of ministerial portfolios. While the literature on coalition governments has devoted considerable attention to predicting the allocation of ministerial portfolios, the allocation of policy payoffs has largely been neglected. We argue that payoff allocation in coalition negotiations is a two-dimensional bargaining process in which political parties simultaneously negotiate about the policy agenda and the distribution of ministerial portfolios. More specifically, we expect that there is a trade-off between policy and office benefits so that control over a ministerial portfolio decreases a party’s policy payoffs in that policy area. Our theoretical expectations are evaluated drawing on a new comparative dataset generated by a quantitative content analysis of coalition agreements. Using this dataset, we analyze policy payoff allocation in 224 multiparty cabinets in 24 Western and Eastern European countries from 1945 until 2015. Our results have important implications for our understanding of coalition formation and governance in multiparty systems.	Heike Klüver	NA
2019	88285	1254	Policy Monitoring in Presidential Multiparty Systems	A recent literature on parliamentary systems shows that coalition members keep tabs on their partners to prevent ministerial policy drift. Building on this literature, in this study I explore intra-coalition politics in presidential democracies. I argue that, similar to parliamentary systems, coalition partners in presidential democracies have an incentive (and do) keep tabs on each other when the ideological distance between them is greater. I also theorize that certain institutional features of presidential systems—particularly the fixed-term nature of the president's office and the capacity to fire ministers without fear of a government breakdown—lead to increased policy monitoring initiatives from junior partners as compared to presidential parties. By analyzing more than 20,000 information requests made between 1995 and 2014 by members of the Brazilian Congress to individual ministers, the results support my expectations of greater policy monitoring between coalition partners under more ideologically heterogeneous cabinets and greater monitoring efforts initiated by junior partners.

2019	84653	340	Minority Governments and Legislative Success	The recent struggle of Theresa May’s cabinet to pass important bills in parliament exemplifies a major problem of minority governments in parliamentary systems: since they do not control a majority, they permanently fear defeat in parliament. Nevertheless, in 2018 about one third of all governments in Europe are minority cabinets. This leads to two major questions: How successful are minority cabinets in the legislative process? And are opposition parties able to pass proposals against the cabinet? In this paper, I argue that minority cabinets are especially successful in passing their legislative agenda if they have formalized long-term agreements with non-cabinet parties which provide majority support and if they cooperate with ethno-regional parties. The empirical analysis is based on a new large dataset that combines original information on minority cabinet attributes and legislative data for about 300 governments in 27 parliamentary democracies since the 1980s. The results of the fractional logit models support the theoretical expectations. My findings provide a comparative insight into the functioning of minority governments and have important implications for research on legislative studies and party competition.	Maria Thürk	NA
2019	84451	316	Do Divisive Primaries Hurt Parties? Evidence from Mexico	We study the effect of primary election divisiveness on general election outcomes in Mexico. Although an extensive literature in American politics has documented evidence that divisive primary elections hurt political parties’ electoral performance, it is unclear whether these findings generalize to other settings. Using an original dataset on legislative primaries at both the federal and the state levels, we find that divisive primaries–measured as those in which the candidate won by a narrow margin–do not affect the party’s electoral performance. However, our results show that the party leaders' interference in favor of a primary aspirant can create or exacerbate internal divisions, and even trigger party defections, significantly hurting the electoral prospects of the party’s eventual nominee. Our findings have important implications for political parties in developing countries, many of which increasingly conduct primary elections but lack the resources or institutions to guarantee that all aspirants will be treated equally.

2019	86085	754	Keeping it in the Family? Party Cohesion, Disagreement and Voter Perception	At times, parties’ internal disagreements become public affairs. Competing factions, leaders and MPs may even highlight internal differences to influence internal debates or to appeal to distinct constituencies. Yet, parties also face incentives to manage their disagreements to present a united face as voters think poorly of parties appearing divided. Scholars have yet to demonstrate the conditions under which real divisions within the party spill over to voter perceptions of the party’s cohesion. Major changes to their public face such as a new leader or shifts in the party’s policies likely highlight underlying divisions, whereas greater stability indicates a more cohesive party. I examine hypotheses from this perspective from a case of historically cohesive parties in the United Kingdom. I develop indicators of internal disagreement over policy preferences issue priorities derived from their largest decision-making body, the party conference, to predict voters’ perceptions of party unity. The results highlight the importance of intra-party politics and the role of party leaders in maintaining an internal coalition while helping to explain conflicting evidence on whether voters perceive parties’ policy change.

2019	86506	1077	Can Interparty Contact Reduce Support for Election Violence? Evidence from a List Experiment in Turkey	How does the form of interparty contact shape attitudinal variation in supporting election violence in diverse constituencies? To answer the afore-stated, this paper argues that interparty contact help reduce prejudice among the electorate living in the same constituencies and thereby it reduces support for election violence against out-party members. Especially, heterogenous constituencies are the most conducive ones to have frequent and positive interparty contact. However, the puzzling scenario is about why we would observe greater support for election violence in constituencies where higher levels of contact are likely. Drawing on the heterogenous electoral districts in Istanbul, I run an online list experiment in order to test whether voters living in competitive constituencies are more supportive of electoral violence. The results show that voters in diverse districts are more likely to support electoral violence unless they are in face-to-face direct contact with the out-party individuals. These results also point to the issue of electoral violence prevention in diverse communities where interventions should be made at the grass-roots level.	Bugra Güngör	NA
2019	86170	819	United we stand, divided we fall? Party divisions in the perspective of the voters	Party scholars argue that unity is a valence component of parties, while divisions have negative electoral consequences. However, other scholars argue that parties can appeal to a broader electorate by taking vague or contradictory position on certain issues. It remains unclear whether all voters react negatively to party divisions and why. Building on psychological research, this paper explores whether individuals react differently to party divisions based on their personality traits. In particular, we argue that those who score low on the personality traits agreeableness or conscientiousness are less prone to evaluate party divisions negatively, because they value social compliance or discipline as less important. The argument is tested in a survey experiment with 1200 Spanish citizens. The findings indicate that the weight voters put on party unity indeed varies depending on personality traits and point to the conditions under which voters evaluate party divisions negatively. The results improve our understanding of party positioning by revealing how parties can appeal broadly and benefit from shaping their campaign strategies considering the personality trait distribution of their targeted electorate.

2019	86730	1205	Why Do Some Municipalities Receive More Government Spending? Presidents influence and the Allocation of Central Government Grants in Taiwan	Scholarship on distributive politics primarily focuses on the role of the legislature, with particular attention to seniority, committee and majority parties in Congress. A growing research agenda is shifting towards more a critical consideration of the presidency, as a tool of the distribution of expenditures, in a particularistic fashion. Rather than, controlled by electorally motivated legislators, distributive politics is driven by presidents who impel the executive branch to allocate fiscal resources to electorally important co-partisan strongholds. To address this question, I test this argument in Taiwan with an original dataset regarding the distribution of central government grants cross 23 municipalities from 2001-2017. The findings suggest that a minister in the executive government with more experience as a municipal official is more likely to distribute, comparatively, more fiscal expenditures to its previously related municipalities, particularly those municipalities which are currently presented by presidential co-partisan mayors and legislators. By granting more fiscal expenditures to these municipalities, the president attempts to gain more leverage in Congress and, thus, reinforce their electoral competitiveness.	Yen-Chieh Liao	NA
2019	86782	1212	The Public Buildings Boom: Distributive and Partisan Politics in the Modernizing Congress	Studies of distributive politics in the modern Congress have wrestled with the interplay between political parties, presidential and executive branch influence, and committee power in allocating federal funds to states and congressional districts. It is widely accepted that most legislators anticipate an electoral benefit for successfully steering pork to their constituents, but the literature has produced inconsistent evidence demonstrating an electoral advantage for pork and has found largely conditional effects for the role of congressional parties and the executive branch. Recent work by Jon Rogowski, Sanford Gordon, and others has probed the historical development of distributive politics in the U.S. This paper advances our understanding of distributive and partisan politics, as well as congressional development more generally, by looking to an earlier era of congressional history. Using original data on the construction of public buildings I describe the unfolding of a precursor to modern-style pork-barrel politics. Moreover, analysis of the factors determining how party and committee leaders distributed federal benefits among the increasingly-careerist legislators of the time reveals the nature of partisan and electoral considerations in even the pre-modern Congress.

2019	77071	49	Economic Geography, Industrialization, and Redistribution: Malapportionment as Compensation	Uneven economic geography leads some sub-national regions to pull ahead of the rest of the country in terms of economic productivity and development. Divergence in sub-national productivity then creates the potential for distributive conflict amongst regions in that nation's central government. These distributive conflicts guide choices about the formation of political institutions for central allocation. We argue that legislative malapportionment is one such institution that is designed to solidify political bargains around centralized redistribution. Using new data on legislative malapportionment and economic geography, we demonstrate a clear link between uneven economic geography, the over-representation of less productive regions, high levels of inter-regional distribution, and feeble centralized attempts to reduce economic inequality.

2019	86246	875	The Political Effects of Local Economic Investment Policies	The distributional consequences of globalization and economic structural change are often regionally concentrated. Recent research suggests that incumbents lose support in harmed regions as voters turn to candidates at the right. Yet, we still know little about what policymakers can do to counter this trend and especially whether incumbents can keep voters from defecting to the radical right by providing place-based compensation policies. In this paper we study the short- and long term political effects of a large-scale, long-running subsidy program in West Germany intended to support municipalities at the Iron Curtain. Exploiting a geographic discontinuity in program eligibility for causal identification, our preliminary results based on election data from Bavaria indicate that the program did not boost the support for the conservative incumbent. Our findings have implications for understanding electoral effects of place-based compensation policies aimed at economic losers as well as the extent to which incumbents can manage the political consequences of lasting structural change in the economy.

2019	86522	1091	Solving the Babylon problem – The formation of transnational political groups in international parliaments	Why would MPs from different nations organize according to their political affiliation instead of their respective nationalities in an international parliament? A territorial cleavage rather than a functional one presumably determines the logic of cooperation in the international realm. Yet, more than fifty transnational political groups have formed worldwide within eleven international parliaments while remaining largely overlooked by the scholarship. In a first attempt to analyze the phenomenon systematically, this paper explores the formation of transnational political groups in a comparative perspective. By drawing on the party and institutionalism literatures, a theory is developed to illuminate the conditions under which transnational political groups form. The theoretical expectations are tested empirically with a new original dataset covering more than sixty international parliaments since their creation to present. The results from a logistic regression analysis lend support to the theory. As nation states are increasingly confronted with political challenges that require supranational decision-making, it becomes highly important to understand how and why international parliaments organize.

2019	77592	62	Reforming to Survive: The Bolshevik Origins of the Welfare State	The Bolshevik revolution was one of the most profound social changes in the modern world. For the first time, a worker-led revolution, which primary aim included the abolishment of private property and with aspirations far beyond the country of origin (Russia), became a credible threat to ruling elites around the world. We specify and further develop a theory of elite concessions in terms of redistributive policies when these elites face a credible threat of revolution. In extension, we draw on new data in order to provide estimates of the Bolshevik revolution on social policy expansion. We do so by using a country’s number of party- and union representatives at the 1919 and 1920 Comintern meeting as an indicator of the credibility of the domestic revolutionary threat. We find that the number of social groups covered in welfare programs, the regulated number of working hours, became more generous in states faced with a more credible threat.

2019	81495	131	Divided Governments and Corruption: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design in American State Governments	This article looks at the effect of partisan control of government on corruption. An extensive literature on accountability and clarity of responsibility suggests that divided governments should be more corrupt than unified ones. This literature argues divided governments blur lines of responsibility and make it harder for voters to hold the incumbent accountable for its past corrupt performance. However, elections are imperfect instruments of accountability. Furthermore, a significant number of studies show that divided governments ensure the system of separation of powers in presidential systems and create effective checks-and-balances mechanisms which should help to prevent abuses of authority, including corruption. To bring clarity to this issue, I combine a regression-discontinuity and a state fixed-effects regression analyses to estimate the effect of partisan control of government in American States on corruption. The results suggest that divided governments do not increase corruption compared to united ones, other things equal.	Elisabeth de Vega Alavedra	NA
2019	86371	968	Electoral Demands and the Emergence of New Parties in Young European Democracies	New political parties are present in almost every election in young democracies. However, unlike the electoral success of new parties, the entry of new parties, in particular in the period after the first few democratic elections, is under-researched. This paper examines how the chances of electoral success affects elites' decisions to form new political parties and the appeals of these parties. It develops and tests the argument that new parties are more likely to emerge under high levels of corruption and low economic growth that cause voter disaffection with established parties. To maximise their electoral appeals, new parties that respond to this voter disaffection adopt centrist positions on the left-right dimension - with the exception of splinter parties that are constrained by the previous policy commitments of their elites. The findings from 10 countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the period between 2000 and 2018 support these arguments. No support was found to the hypotheses about two other representational strategies of new parties: addressing unoccupied voter niches on the left-right dimension or individual policy issues ignored by existing parties.

2019	86200	843	Mass transformation or lone defectors? Legislators' goals and party switching strategies in Western Europe	Party switching occurs when members of parliament change their party affiliation. This behaviour can pose a severe threat to party unity and endanger accountability and representation. While the literature on the topic has growth in recent years, to date, researchers have rarely explored the different patterns that lead politicians to change party individually or collectively. Since the logic of these two de-affiliation strategies is different, I argue that they might also be explained by differing factors. In particular, I suppose that legislators switch party in group or alone to reach different sets of goals. To test my hypotheses, I rely on an original database of all inter-party movements occurred in fourteen Western European countries from 1945 to 2015. The results of my statistical analysis show that ideological concerns are at the origin of group switching, while solo-defectors are usually instrumentally-motivated and seek re-election and/or a career advancement.

2019	86203	845	Candidate turnover and party policy change in Central and Eastern Europe	We have previously suggested using the turnover of candidates from one election to the next as an overall proxy for party change. This paper studies the relationship between candidate change and party policy change. The causality can run in both ways. On the one hand, candidate change reflects general personnel change among parties and policy ideas can change following the change of people. On the other hand, policy changes can alienate existing candidates and/or draw in new people. Our analysis finds that candidate and policy change are linked when controlling for factors like party size, change in support etc. For candidate change, we rely on our original dataset “Electoral Candidates in Central and Eastern Europe” covering 200,000 candidates from 60 elections in nine democracies since 1990. For measuring policy change, we use MARPOR and CHES – two authoritative datasets with time-series data on party policies. Instead of employing ready-made aggregate indices (Left-Right / Gal-Tan), we develop new measures accounting for changes in specific policies; this is necessary as previous studies have cautioned against using the Left-Right scale in the region.

2019	86516	1085	Youth parties: representing the young or replicating the old?	This paper narrows the gap between youth political participation and party membership by analysing a newly conducted, broad-based survey of youth party members in Germany (2017-2018). A major research gap exists in both the research area of political parties as well as the area of political participation. The individual level survey data (n > 1200) collected for this study allow an assessment of the socio-economic background of youth party members, their motivation, their political and career ambitions, their position within their youth organisation, and their relationship to their parent party. From this, conclusions about the purpose of youth party organisations are drawn, as to whether they primarily serve as a representation tool for the interests of young citizens or whether they primarily function as a recruitment pool for prospective leaders in the parent party. Furthermore, an aggregate level comparison of youth parties and the parent parties regarding their composition and political positions helps us analysing which youth parties constitute a political identity of their own and which are simply a younger replication of their parent parties.

2019	86667	1192	Interrupted Continuities: The Birth, Death and Resurrection of Political Legacies	A fast-growing literature on historical legacies exalts how persistently the past maps on present-day political attitudes and behaviour. A common assumption in this literature is that legacies follow a monotone pattern, with their impact either remaining constant or decaying over time. We propose an alternative, non-linear trajectory, whereby exogenous shocks can re-activate the signalling capacity of the past. We assess this theory of ‘interrupted continuities’ focusing on the post-crisis rise of the radical right in Greece. Employing a within-prefecture, cross-community design, we use original data to reveal the historical aspect of the Golden Dawn (GD) vote. We find a strong correlation between civi-war-driven anti-Communism and GD support. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, anti-communism a) stems from the civil-war experience and does not precede it; and b) does not predict the GD vote before the crisis. Narratives born out of traumatic experiences endure via local memory, becoming politically relevant when the opportunity structure arises. Apart from enhancing our understanding about the roots of radical right support, the findings qualify existing accounts of how the past feeds into people’s political predispositions.

2019	86531	1100	The Political Attitudes and Policy Views of Latino Republicans in the U.S.	In this paper, we examine the determinants of political attitudes and policy views of Latino Republicans. In particular, this paper examines the extent to which Latino Republican attitudes and policy views are more like Republican or more like Latino Democrats. We find that partisanship trumps ethnicity on most issues for Latino Republicans; however, Latino Republicans are distinct from white Republicans on a host of Latino-centered policy issues. Latino Republicans are unique due to a variety of factors, including immigrant background and national origin. We conclude by reflecting on the ways in which the Trump presidency will affect the attitudes and views of Latino Republicans in coming years.	Jason Casellas	NA
2019	84474	321	Timeless Landscape or Diverse Urbanity? How Partisanship and Ethnicity Refract National Attachment in the United States and England	We investigate how the content of American and British national identity varies according to the group lens of the beholder – particularly ethnicity and ideology. While much work has examined criteria for distinguishing those high or low in nationalism, ‘true’ Americans from others, or the ‘ethnic-civic’ dimension of national identity, we know far less about the affective aspect of nationalism (how the symbolic composition of national affections varies by ethnicity, partisanship, and other criteria). We hypothesize that whites and non-whites, progressives and conservatives, all possess national identities but are attracted to different myth-symbol complexes. We examine how respondents across three samples (2018 CCES, MTurk, and BBC/YouGov) rated how multiple factors (such as the countryside, sports, diversity, history, and parks) connect to their perceptions of American and English identity. We test whether such responses change depending on the ‘optical’ lens of the beholder (Kaufmann 2008), as national identity, territory and people are the ‘light’ that is refracted through the interpretive ‘lens’ of ideology and interests. This has implications for better understanding contemporary nationalism and for discerning a ‘hidden’ ethnic white majority.	David Leal, Eric Kaufmann	NA
2019	85670	531	Does the Content of Ethnicity Matter? Religion, Language, Race and Ethnic Voting	Why do some ethnic groups vote along ethnic lines while others do not? This paper looks at whether the objective characteristics of ethnicity – in terms of language, religion and race – affect ethnic voting. I address three sets of questions: (1) are ethnic groups that are objectively different from other groups of their country more likely to vote ethnically? (2) is ethnic voting higher among groups that are linguistically, religiously and racially homogeneous? (3) do some ethnic markers, such as religion, induce more ethnic voting than others? Using a dataset covering 146 ethnic groups and 50 democracies worldwide, I find that within-group homogeneity increases ethnic voting. On balance, however, there is little evidence that between-group heterogeneity or the identity of the ethnic dimension affect ethnic voting. These results suggest that a group’s internal characteristics and the cohesiveness of its members play a key role in explaining its voting behavior.	Christian Houle	NA
2019	86099	766	Formal participation of immigrant voters in Germany: First results from the Immigrant German Election Study (IMGES)	Based on a novel election survey fielded in the context of the federal election of 2017 (N=947), the paper analyzes the formal and informal political participation of immigrant voters in Germany. For electoral research, voters with an immigrant background provide a theoretically interesting group, since their political socialization differs from the experiences of the native population in many ways. Whether established theories of electoral research can also explain political participation of immigrant voters, or whether this is determined predominantly by migrant-specific characteristics, therefore is the central research question of this study. The paper focuses on Germany’s two biggest groups of migrant voters: people from Turkey and people migrated from the former Soviet-Union and its successor-states, pointing also to group differences regarding turnout of migrant voters.

2019	131984	1280	Party Systems and Ethnic Bias in UK Elections: A Regional Comparison	We examine whether the composition of political party systems can work to mitigate or exacerbate racial and ethnic inequalities in election results. Using data from the UK, we compare the impact of candidate race/ethnicity on constituency election results in England, Scotland, and Wales. Do the characteristics of the dominant parties within each of these regions affect the ethnic dynamics between incumbents and their challengers? We hypothesize that England’s two dominant “catch-all” type parties (Conservatives and Labour), in attempting to appeal to a broad base, will generate lower levels of ethnic bias, compared to party systems that have a strong party devoted to national interests. In particular, due to the Scottish Nationalist Party or Plaid Cymru in Wales, we expect the Scottish and Welsh systems to exhibit a stronger bias against ethnic minority candidates.	Mary Stegmaier	NA
2019	86168	818	From De-alignment to Re-alignment? The Transformation of Social Cleavages in Germany	For decades, the changing role of the traditional cleavage structure and its impact on electoral behaviour has been debated in Germany and elsewhere. Until the federal election 2005, however, analyses concerning the link between cleavage structures and party choice provided clear evidence for the persistence of cleavage voting in Germany. Most recent result, however, undermine the story of stability. The federal election of 2009 is a watershed in this regard: while the social democrats suffered massive losses, non-voting increased massively among the working class and lower service professions. Against the backdrop of a brief analysis of the evolving cleavage structure in Germany since the 1950s, we then focus on the decisive years since 2009. In particular, we analyse the linkages between changes in class voting, changes in turnout, and the rise of a new right-wing populist party in Germany, the AfD. By separating short-term and long-term effects, our analysis therefore has important implications for the understanding of cleavage voting and the rise of right-wing politics.

2019	85868	630	A new working class? Political preferences and behavior of production and service workers in post-industrial societies	Recent research has extensively documented the partisan realignment of industrial production workers and socio-cultural professionals in Europe. Yet, we know substantially less about the political behavior and attitudes of low-skilled service workers. This paper analyzes whether service workers will join the ranks of industrial production workers (in political terms) or whether they will instead display distinct political preferences, hence further undermining the potential of a working-class coalition. A comparison of production and service workers based on European Social Survey data indicates that, in spite of strong differences in their socio-demographic composition, these two classes constitute a homogeneous electoral constituency. These two groups display similar preferences on cultural and economic issues, as well as similar patterns of electoral behavior. In this paper, I also analyze whether the politicization of these issues by political parties moderates the differences in preferences between these two classes across political contexts. The hierarchical models incorporating information on the electoral supply indicate that production and service workers remain a viable and homogenous electoral coalition even in countries where economic and cultural issues are highly politicized.

2019	86512	1081	The New Rural-Urban Divide in Politics: Evidence from Germany	Geographically defined identities have always played an important role in political conflict. Currently, scholars observe a new rural-urban divide that may explain the recent success of so-called populist parties, candidates, and movements. Yet, the nature of this new divide remains disputed. We empirically test the notion that the divide between citizens living in rural areas and those living in urban centers is not primarly rooted in different economic interests, but in cultural identities, i.e. citizens´sense of who they are, where they belong and what they deserve. To achieve this, we produce novel small-area estimates of cultural identity from geo-coded survey data and combine them with official statistics for more than 400 German counties and for the federal elections 2013 and 2017. Our results are based on Bayesian seemingly-unrelated regression models and have important implications for the recent political conflict and populist challenge in Western democracies.

2019	85700	543	The regio-cultural roots of voting for the radical right: How cultural 'remoteness' affects voting behavior in Germany	While an enormous body of research investigates what drives radical right voting, we know comparatively little about the cultural roots of this phenomenon. We add to this research agenda by investigating how “cultural remoteness” of regions affects voting for the radical right in Germany. We argue that voters who live in districts which are culturally more distinct and exclusive are more likely to vote for radical right parties. Cultural remoteness strengthens feelings of local identity and the need to isolate oneself from global developments. We approximate cultural remoteness by relying on linguistic micro-data from a unique dialectic survey conducted in the 19th century in 45,000 German schools. Using voting results on the district level we then predict voting for the Alternative für Deutschland and the Nazi party in 7 elections. In line with our theoretical argument, we find that cultural remoteness predicts radical right voting in Germany. Our findings have important implications for studies of extremism and the radical right.	Hanno Hilbig	NA
2019	77591	61	Cultural cleavage and secularization: The changing polarization about traditionalism and authoritarianism in Europe	While it is largely uncontested that in Europe cultural cleavage has superseded the economic one in polarizing both parties and electorates, some recent papers claim that cultural issues are also losing their dividing power. We approach cultural cleavage as two distinctive cultural divides: moral traditionalism-progressivism dimension that refers to religiously inspired attitudes to matters of procreation, family and gender roles; and secular authoritarianism-libertarianism dimension that captures predominantly secular attitudes towards matters of immigration, law, and order. Focusing on country-level differences in polarization about those two cultural divides, we seek to explain them from the perspective of secularization. We hypothesize, that a decline in religion sparks a decline in polarization about moral traditionalism between the religious and the secular; and that it sparks the ascendancy of an all-out secular polarization about authoritarianism between the more and the less educated. We use data from the four waves of the EVS (1980-2008) to test, by means of regression analysis, whether indeed cultural polarization is affected by processes of secularization.	Anna Kulkova	NA
2019	86942	1224	Political outsiders: Can social extremism and political incorrectness work as a signal of competence?	This paper explores why voters might vote for political candidates who espouse extreme ideologies the voters themselves do not support, or who offend ethnic groups to whom the voters belong, or display personal behaviors the voters do not approve. We develop a model in which voters may have a preference for candidates who are outsiders to the political establishment, and are willing to tolerate candidate characteristics they dislike provided that these characteristics increase the probability that the candidate is an outsider. We find that lower levels of trust towards traditional politics may favor the emergence of outsider candidates and the use of extreme behaviour or political platforms by candidates regardless of their actual preferences. We successfully test the inference mechanism on which the model is built using survey data from several European countries.	Jerome Gonnot	NA
2019	78489	74	The Janus-Faced Nature of Radical Voting: Status Anxiety at the Roots of Far-Right and Far-Left Support	While a growing literature is looking at the effect of relative social and economic decline on far-right (radical right) parties, few studies reflect on this psychological phenomenon on far-left (radical left) parties. Drawing from the latest round of the European Social Survey and Eurobarometer surveys, multilevel models show strong and positive association between lower levels of subjective status and support for right- and left-wing radicalism in thirteen European countries. The difference between the two forms of radicalism lies in the referential point to which individuals compare themselves to. While the far-right supporters’ status anxiety is driven through comparison with emerging ethnic groups, far-left supporters’ status anxiety develops through comparison with perceptions of their parents’ generations where opportunities were greater. Traditional attitudes magnify the effects of social decline on radical support: it is reinforced by anti-immigrant support for the far right and by pro-equality measure for the far left. This study shows the relevance of including relative social decline as a reconciling economic and cultural factor between far-right and far-left.	Diane Bolet	NA
2019	86494	1066	Fringe Voters Calling. Undecided voters at the extremes of the left-right dimension and their influence on mainstream party responsiveness	Increasing electoral support for challenger parties has altered mainstream parties’ strategic considerations in most West European party systems. However, previous work that has been concerned with party responsiveness toward public opinion has predominantly focused on left-right shifts of the median voter or movements of parties’ supporters (Adams 2012). In this paper, I advance this body of research by focusing on mainstream parties’ responsiveness toward positional movements of their fringe voters, i.e. those voters that are positioned toward the extreme end of the left-right dimension and that waver between a centrist mainstream party and a more radical challenger party. I argue that the rise of challenger parties forces mainstream parties to target this so far under-researched voter group by shifting away from the centre of the left-right dimension. I test this claim empirically by employing voters’ left-right positions in combination with parties’ like-dislike scores (national election studies) and party position data (MARPOR/CMP) from 13 West European countries since 1985. Moreover, I investigate when mainstream parties respond to position shifts of their fringe voters rather than movements of the median voter.	Werner Krause	NA
2019	86604	1162	Socialists Turned into Nationalists: an Issue Ownership Model of Nationalist Party Entrance	Why does the left keep losing the working class voters, once the backbone of its support, to the nationalist parties? Conventional spatial models predict that (1) the swing voters, rather than the core voters of the left will (2) convert to a center-right party, rather than a nationalist party. In this paper, I argue that this pattern arises when the left emphasizes its cultural platform at the expense of its economic platform. To illustrate this point, I build a model where parties can choose which issues they will claim ownership on. If their strategies alienate sufficiently many voters, the nationalist party chooses to enter the election. The model predicts that the nationalist party is most likely to enter the election when the left focuses on cultural dimension and the right focuses on economic dimension. This results in cultural conservative and economic moderate left voters converting to the center-right party, while cultural conservative and economic left voters convert to the nationalist party. The result shows that nationalist parties are best thwarted when the left remains an economic left.	Jaerin Kim	NA
2019	85853	617	The change of motives to become and to stay a party member: An empirical analysis of the membership of the German political parties for the period 1998 to 2017	To what extent have motives that encourage individuals to become and stay a party member changed over the last twenty years? In order to answer this question scholarship assessing changes in motives of individuals to join parties relies on repeated cross-sectional data. Therefore, we present findings from the German Party Membership Study to understand the lifecycle, period and cohort effects that drive an individual’s motivation to become and stay a party member. This unique study relies on pooled cross-sectional data of 50,000 members of six parties collected in three waves over a period of 19 years. In using this data, we are able to conduct an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. This allows a research design to understand the motives of people to join a party. Moreover, we are able to outline potential mechanisms, which explain why the importance of certain motivations change over time. Findings from our study have implications for our understanding of party politics in an age of increasing public dealignment with political parties.	Yvonne Lüdecke	NA
2019	86106	772	The threefold social selectivity of participation in political parties – an empirical analysis of the membership of the German political parties in 2017	Are the decisions to join a political party, to become active within a party and to leave a party dependent on individuals’ socioeconomic status? Political parties are the central mediating actors between the population and the state; thus, it is reasonable to assume that unequal participation within parties fosters unequal political representation of different social groups. However, due to data limitations no study has hitherto examined the social selectivity of the whole party membership cycle. We shed light on these issues by analysing original data from the German Party Membership Study of 2017. Applying ordinal and multinomial logistic regression analysis, we find that socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to become and to stay party members and have a lower proclivity for holding political offices. These effects persist even after controlling for socio-psychological variables and general incentives. However, in line with recent findings on voter turnout we show that social selectivity is partly mediated by internal and external political efficacy. Parties must take the latter into account when formulating strategies to counteract this normatively problematic state of threefold social selectivity.	Frederik Springer	NA
2019	85256	430	Party Membership, Pre-Parliamentary Socialization and Party Cohesion	Party membership seems to lose relevance in most established democracies. Yet, what kind of behavior does long-term party membership imply? In this paper, I argue that party membership is crucial to internalizing group norms. Using data on the party membership background of ca. 2,000 MPs of the German Bundestag from 1953 to 2013, I show that MPs that have joined their party at a younger age and that have been a member for a longer time before their candidacy, are less likely to disagree with the majority of their party on free votes. Examining free votes on which discipline is lifted, alternative sources generating unity are controlled for by design. Results are in line with expectations generated from social identity theory and underscore the importance of party membership for party coherence. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings' implications in light of recent developments in parties' candidate recruitment.	Jochen Rehmert	NA
2019	81591	139	Voters’ Reactions to Legislator Dissent across Electoral Systems: Personal Integrity and Constituency Loyalty	Research from the United States and United Kingdom shows that legislators who dissent from their party are rewarded by their constituents. This has raised concerns about party cohesiveness and, in turn, parties’ ability to govern and voters' ability to hold parties accountable. However, scholars argue this may be restricted to single-member district systems where accountability linkage between constituency voters and legislator is stronger. This article conducts the first country comparative test of how legislator dissent influence vote choice across electoral systems. We demonstrate, first, that the effect does travel to a less likely Danish multi-member district system, but also, second, that the effect is weaker among voters in Denmark compared to US and UK. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that this difference is due to varying preferences for constituency representation. The findings imply that concerns associated with party dissent are present but less pertinent in the more widespread multi-member district systems.	Helene Helboe Pedersen	NA
2019	80858	111	Allowed to turn down? The determinants of attitudes towards activation policies and perceived levels of deservingness.	Since the 1980ies European welfare states use a set of labor market policy instruments called activation or welfare-to-work measures about which we know very little. At the same time there is general evidence that attitudes on generosity vary according to possible different claimant groups, referred to as “deservingness”. ESS 8 provides data on public support for cutting benefits (by different levels) in case that recipients should turn down a job offer, which belongs to the type of activation policies using negative incentive reinforcement or so-called ‘demanding’ activation policies. Furthermore ESS 8, via a survey experiment, allows for an analysis of related attitudes according to four different groups of recipients (i.e. young, old, single parents, other unemployed). These data for the first time offer the possibility to disentangle attitudes towards demanding activation policies and differences in preferences on the background of different levels of “deservingness”, attributed to different groups. Using multilevel analysis we demonstrate how attitudes towards activation policies and also perceptions of deservingness vary systematically according to material self-interest, ideological preferences, and national legacies.

2019	86685	1199	When Voters Favour the Social Investment Welfare State: Evidence from Survey Experiments in Japan	We investigate when voters favour social investment (SI). Welfare states have transformed their core policies due to low economic growth. One recent approach is SI, which aims at shifting the economy from the traditional welfare state to the high-productivity economy via long-term and inclusive human capital formation. SI is a popular welfare approach in many developed countries with governments promoting SI and evidence of public support for such policies. However, other governments do not utilise SI, presumably because it is unpopular among voters. Focusing on Japan, where SI is less emphasised, we hypothesise that voters don't favour SI because (1) they do not know that SI reduces economic inequality; (2) they do not know SI strengthens the knowledge-based sector; (3) they cannot find a political party that would promote SI; or (4) they avoid spending their tax on investment without knowing its clear effects on economic growth. To find out which is true, we conduct survey experiments that randomly give respondents different information about SI. Our results elucidate what kinds of SI policies could be achieved without damaging electoral fortunes.	Mark Brazzill, Yuki Yanai	NA
2019	85608	511	Public Attitudes toward Climate Security: A Cross-Country Analysis	European Union has long been a frontrunner in climate change mitigation policies. However, public opinion on climate change worldwide is an important component of how climate change can be tackled by states. One communication strategy is to securitize climate change and highlight how climate change threatens humanity, states, or individuals. However, under what conditions publics perceive threat from climate change is a relatively understudied area of securitization research. We address this question by conducting a comparative analysis of public attitudes towards climate security using data from Pew Research Center Spring 2015 Global Attitudes Survey. The countries in the study have diverse performance in addressing climate change, ranging from European Union members with pledges to mitigate climate change to countries with high levels of climate scepticism like the United States. This study will make a contribution to the existing literature by shedding light on what makes the public to consider an issue as a ‘threat’ rather than a ‘concern,’ thereby enabling securitizing moves to receive consent and moral support from the public.

2019	85313	450	What Shapes Citizens’ Preferences towards Climate Change Policies? Insights from Choice Experiments	What are citizens’ preferences towards public policies for rapid decarbonization? And to what extent do a) the concrete design features of a policy, and b) 'social influences' like social norms and cues by opinion leaders affect citizens’ level of policy support? Based on a representative sample of Americans (n = 1,520), we investigate public preferences with respect to two areas that can contribute to rapid decarbonization: the phase-out of fossil fuel cars, and the employment of carbon capture and storage technologies. Using discrete choice experiments, we elicit Americans’ preferences on various policy scenarios to get insights on the social acceptability of different pathways to decarbonization. Our approach allows to disentangle the importance citizens attach to various policy design features (e.g., policy instrument, timing, and costs), and demonstrates the role of social influences in preference formation. The study contributes to ongoing research in psychology and political science on the impact of social norms and elite cues on individual attitudes and behavior. Moreover, it yields concrete implications for policymakers concerned with the question of how to achieve the decarbonization of our economies.	Silvia Pianta	NA
2019	84116	270	Migrant status, health systems, and welfare reciprocity	Norms of reciprocity are widely seen to shape support for the welfare state and to condition reactions to immigration. In this paper, we present the results of a conjoint experiment fielded in Canada, the UK, and Germany, examining the relative importance of migrant status and characteristics in shaping whether survey respondents believe that immigrants should have to pay out of pocket fees for health care. By conducting this experiment in three very different health systems and asking about the size of the preferred fee, we are able to examine variation in the strength of norms of universality and welfare state conditionality. We complement this experiment with an austerity-priming experiment that allows us to examine whether a high-cost context induces more welfare state chauvinism.	Michael Donnelly	NA
2019	86381	978	Location Matters: Is the Immigration Debate over Stocks or Flows?	The vast research on immigration in recent years has documented a number of important empirical regularities with respect to the determinants of natives' views on immigration. However, this research has overwhelming focused on attitudes toward immigration in general, without distinguishing between natives' preferences with respect to foreigners already in the country (immigration 'stock') versus those expected to enter the country in the future (immigration 'flows'). This paper studies whether and how citizens' attitudes differ with respect to the two groups of immigrants. We begin by theorizing about the implications of each group on individual preferences toward immigration. We then test those predictions by replicating three widely-cited experiments on immigration attitudes, but design them such that participants are asked about either immigration stocks or flows. We report the experimental results from four advanced economies (US, Germany, Italy and Spain). Our preliminary analysis shows that attitudes toward the two groups of immigrants differ substantially and in a theoretically predictable manner. Based on these results, we offer guidance as to how future research should study public opinion on immigration stocks and flows.	Omer Solodoch	NA
2019	86616	1171	Does Competition over Public Services Decrease Support for Residency Rights of Immigrants? Evidence From the United Kingdom	This paper tests the theory that welfare chauvinism explains opposition to immigration, using two experiments embedded in a nationally representative household panel survey. We suggest that economic self-interest has been too narrowly conceptualised as labour market competition, and that instead we should consider the role of competition over public services – schooling, healthcare and housing. In a conjoint experiment, we vary hypothetical migrant characteristics on these dimensions, and ask respondents to choose who they would grant the right to remain. We consider heterogeneous treatment effects using geocoded data on the performance of relevant public services in the respondent’s local area. In a vignette experiment, we vary the location of the hypothetical immigrant, to test whether local residents (who would be in direct competition for local public services) are treated less favourably than migrants who live elsewhere. We advance on previous work by focusing on the decision to grant the right to remain, rather than enter the country.	Nicole Martin	NA
2019	86710	1202	The Structure of European Public Preferences for Asylum and Refugee Policy:A Cross National Conjoint Experiment	The aim of our research is to analyze the asylum and refugee policy preferences of citizens and how they vary across individuals. We do so by conducting an original conjoint experiment in four different EU member states: Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Poland. Our goal is to focus on the underlying principles of asylum policy and on the public’s support for the different trade-offs that are associated with the various policy models. We are particularly interested in exploring whether and how public attitudes to different dimensions of asylum and refugee policies are related to individual characteristics, with a focus on public understandings and preferences for ‘control’ and the degree of trust in public institutions at national and EU levels. Our findings will highlight potential dilemmas between different asylum policy models and help identify possible common ground for reforms of the EU’s common asylum policies.	Anne-Marie Jeannet	NA
2019	85680	534	Economic Insecurity and Attitudes Towards Immigrants in Europe: Evidence from Panel Surveys	To what extent do individuals’ preferences on immigration policy shift in response to changes in their personal economic circumstances? Addressing this question with cross-sectional survey data is difficult because the correlation between individuals’ economic standing and their views on immigration can be due to unobservable characteristics that affect both. To deal with this empirical challenge, this paper uses panel survey data from the Netherlands (LISS) and Germany (GLES) that trace the labour market experiences and the political attitudes of citizens over several years. We argue that an individual’s baseline view on immigration is best predicted by relatively immutable cultural predispositions, while personal experiences of economic hardship explain changes in anti-immigrant attitudes over time. We also argue that party identification (PID) is the filter through which citizens make sense of the political world and we therefore expect it to be a key variable that conditions how actual and perceived economic hardship affects attitudes towards immigrants.

2019	84698	350	Why are people more negative about immigration in places where there are few immigrants?	Support for Brexit and associated negative feelings about immigration were highest in places with the lowest proportions of immigrants. This finding represents something of a puzzle, as it suggests that attitudes towards immigration may not be shaped by individuals’ actual lived experiences of immigration. What, then, are they shaped by? In this article, we approach the issue from a slightly different perspective from previous studies and examine the conditions under which the formation of ethnic in-group loyalty (among white British/English) leads to negative feelings towards ethnic outgroups (immigrants and non-white British/English). In doing so, we pay particular attention to within-group economic inequality at the local level. We hypothesise that when ethnic in-groups are economically homogenous at the local level, in-group solidarity and out-group hostility are greater than when ethnic groups are economically heterogeneous and thus differentiated on cross-cutting dimensions. We test the hypothesis through quantitative analysis of data from the British Election Study between 2014 and 2016.	Matthew Polacko	NA
2019	86328	935	The Effect of Local Context on Citizens’ Attitudes toward Immigration Policy	With the massive influx of migrants, the ethnic and religious composition of European societies is changing rapidly. Alongside these developments, most European countries experienced an increasing demand for more restrictive immigration policies in recent years. Existing work mostly focuses on the association between the two phenomena on a national level. Research looking into the effects of immigration and socio-demographic composition on immigration policy preferences on a local level remains limited. I will contribute to the ongoing debate by analyzing the effect of local contexts on individual immigration policy preferences in Germany, recently struck by populist challenges. I will use fine-grained and uniquely suited data from the German city of Mannheim combining survey data with detailed information on the ethnic composition of local contexts as well as the locations of refugee reception centres and mosques. The survey contains information on the respondents’ exact geo-location as well as their preferences regarding immigration policy. In order to estimate the causal effects, I will match respondents based on both individual characteristics and their local context only allowing for variation in specific contextual conditions.

2019	86713	1204	Attitudes towards Immigration across Age Cohorts: Assessing Compositional, Behavioral, and Value-based Explanations	Recent research has established that membership of an age-cohort is a social context that systematically explains differences in attitudes towards immigration between younger and older individuals. However, the reasons for this are not well understood. This study sets out to fill this gap by investigating why attitudes towards immigration systematically differ between older and younger generations of Europeans. Applying hierarchical age-period-cohort models using 8 rounds of European Social Survey data (2002-2016) in 25 European countries, we aim to adjudicate between three possible explanations. The value-based explanation portrays the effect of age-cohort as being due to a gradual shift in values such as a rise in post-materialism and multiculturalism. The behavioral explanation argues that whereby cohorts are differently exposed to immigration during their youth, which offers varying levels of contact with foreigners during their formative years. Finally, the compositional explanation maintains the effect is due to differences in the characteristics of the younger cohorts compared to the older cohorts such as a larger proportion of first and second-generation immigrants or the presence of individuals with a lower socio-economic background.

2019	85766	566	No country for asylum seekers? How short-term exposure to refugees influences attitudes and voting behavior in Hungary	How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting. We code exposure to refugees at the municipality level using state media, an independent online news site, and data from journalists on social media. Towns through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect, which we estimate between 1.7 and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition Jobbik party gained votes in these towns, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in the subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are punished by voters skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition within the right, as individuals in exposed towns are more fearful of immigrants and support more restrictive policies, though only if they identify with right-wing parties.

2019	81945	147	Diversity, Socialization, and the Rise of Positive Perceptions of Immigration in the UK	Anti-immigrant attitudes are challenging numerous established political systems by fueling the rise of radical-right parties. It is however unclear whether this trend in attitudes is likely to persist in the future or whether generational replacement will reverse this trend. Drawing on recent advances in hierarchical modeling to estimate cohort effects, this paper shows that younger cohorts in the UK are systematically more positive about immigration than older cohorts and that this is likely to be a result of reaching their formative years at a time when immigrant-origin diversity had become the norm in the UK. This finding is in line with contact theory of immigration. The paper also illustrates that greater income equality appears to create less threatening circumstances in which positive attitudes to immigrants and immigration may thrive. The implications of the paper’s findings are that through cohort replacement, British citizens may become increasingly tolerant of immigrant-origin diversity. Keywords: Immigration, public opinion, cohort analysis, income inequality, United Kingdom.	Anja Neundorf	NA
2019	85554	505	Migration and Election Outcomes: Evidence from London	How does non-citizen suffrage affect the outcome of elections? To examine this question, we bring together ward-level census data, voting outcomes, electoral registers and survey data. We exploit unique variation in changes to the density and composition of migrants from the European Union (EU) across London at the start of the millennium. Overall, increases in the share of these migrants, who enjoyed voting rights in London elections, shift political outcomes to the left. However, we highlight different patterns associated with specific migrant sub-groups and find evidence that political socialisation in the country of birth influences vote choice in the host society. Our analysis challenges a common approach that treats migrants as a more monolithic group with largely homogeneous preferences based on their current economic situation. We use these findings to speculate about the future of party politics in post-Brexit Britain, and the importance of political rights of migrants more broadly.	Elena Pupaza	NA
2019	86313	922	Immigration as ‘flash issue’: How the refugee crisis has altered electoral behavior in Europe	The European refugee crisis has put immigration on top of citizens’ issue priorities. Immigration touches upon emotionally charged questions of identity and has the potential to transform the political landscape. Its increased salience not only altered the way many Europeans think about immigration, but also affected their electoral behavior as evidenced by recent electoral successes of populist radical right-wing parties (PRRP) in many European countries. Using longitudinal ESS data, we show that in the wake of the refugee crisis anti-immigrant sentiments translate more often into the election of PRRP. Put differently, the refugee crisis mobilized previously dormant attitudes and channeled them into electoral politics. This general effect is moderated by different individual- and country-level factors. At the individual level, feelings of distrust and a lack of political efficacy strengthen the effect of anti-immigrant sentiments on the PRPP vote. At the country-level, the programmatic offers by established parties influence support for PRRP. While support for PRRP is generally stronger among immigration sceptics, it is particularly pronounced in countries where established parties opened a representation gap by converging on moderately pro-immigration positions.

2019	86110	774	The electoral repercussions of liberal labor market access for immigrants: Evidence from Germany	Governments across Europe are restricting labor market access for asylum seekers, with often detrimental consequences for the livelihood of refugees and the public finances of host societies. This raises the following questions: Are the benefits of restrictive immigrant policies political rather than economic, and do incumbent governments receive an electoral edge by implementing such policies? In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment in Germany, where, following a deterministic assignment rule, certain regions were exempted from a reform that liberalized labor market access for refugees. Using difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity designs, we find that the incumbent vote share sharply increases in regions with restrictive labor market access. Exploring different mechanisms, our results suggest that this effect is primarily driven by differential candidate entry: In regions with restrictive labor market access, fewer conservative and populist candidates are running for office. Our results suggest that not only do immigration inflows have direct electoral repercussions, but immigrant policies do also.	Moritz Marbach	NA
2019	84691	348	How national and ethnic identifications affect anti-immigrant and anti-majority sentiment among immigrant voters in Germany	In times of large scale immigration, knowing about the intergroup attitudes and their determinants is of importance for political integration. We use a theoretical framework that mainly draws on the Social Identity Approach by Tajfel & Turner (1979) and Turner et al. (1987) to derive a general model of intergroup attitudes for migrants.This paper aims to investigate what affects immigrants’ attitudes towards the majority population, other established migrant groups, and refugees. We draw on new data from 2017 of a representative survey of the two biggest immigrant groups in Germany (N=1,027), Germans of Turkish decent and Resettlers from theformer Soviet Union. Our results indicate that ethnic group identification, dual identity and German identification are the strongest predictors for attitudes towards the majority population, with ethnic identity among Turkish and dual identity among Russian-Germans to be negatively related. For attitudes towards the other migrant group and refugees, ethnic identification is the strongest negative predictor whereas national identification among Turkish and dual identity among Russian- Germans have a positive, protecting effect.

2019	75433	7	All We Need Is Contact: The Effect of Asylum Seekers on the Vote Share of the Far Right in Germany	Anecdotal evidence suggests that the influx of asylum seekers and the rise of the far right may be connected. In our paper, we use the 2017 Bundestag elections in Germany as a case study to answer the following questions: How does the proportion of asylum seekers on the local level affect the vote share of the far-right? Do different legal categories of asylum seekers have different effects on the far-right vote share? Does the frequency of contact (as measured by urbanity) between the natives and asylum seekers strengthen or weaken this effect? Our findings show that regardless of their legal category, asylum seekers decrease the far-right vote share. We also found evidence that this effect is stronger in rural districts than in urban districts.	Nourhan Elsayed	NA
2019	85756	563	The Economic Geography Behind Challenger Parties Success.	Since the 2000s, challenger parties have witnessed a rise in their popularity, while mainstream ones seem to be experiencing a phase of decline or stagnation. Nonethelss, regardless of the general trend, the geography of this success is not as unidirectional. When we look past the national level regions differ extensively. My research focus is on the role played by loss of economic status on support for challenger parties. In particular, I look at the interaction between the different levels (national, regional and individual) at which resentment and uncertainty can trigger the success of challenger parties. I argue that economic malaise opens a window of opportunity which challenger parties can exploit to mobilise voters through different strategies, not necessarely related to economic issues. To answer my research question I employ multilevel modeling of individual data from the European Election Study, regional-level from Eurostat and country-level from Eurostat and the Comparative Political Dataset. With a comparative study I investigate how opportunities for challenger parties are engendered.	Francesco Colombo	NA
2019	86095	763	Do election campaigns tighten the margin of victory? A cross-country comparison of the dynamics of vote margins	A well-known phenomenon in US presidential election campaigns is that the electoral margin tightens over the course of the campaign. In that sense, election campaigns may make alternative futures imaginable and tangible. However, can this pattern be found elsewhere, outside the US? Relying on a comparable conceptualization of competitiveness, this study evaluates the dynamics of vote margins in comparative perspective using the “Dataset on Polls and the Timeline of Elections” (Jennings & Wlezien, 2018). The results show that vote margins tend to narrow across a wide range of different institutional settings. Yet, the analyses also uncover some heterogeneity in the trends across countries as well as deviant cases. Overall, the results contribute to the ongoing debates about the functions of election campaigns in modern democracies.	Julia Partheymueller	NA
2019	86083	752	Campaigns, learning, and political knowledge	Do electoral campaigns affect political knowledge? While there is little evidence of campaign effects on voter attitudes in advanced democracies, campaigns appear to be more consequential in new democracies, where partisan attachments and ideological stances are weaker. Building on this insight, we study campaign effects on political knowledge in Latin America, combining survey experiments and original panel surveys conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, and México. We develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes knowledge about institutions, from policy-specific and campaign-specific knowledge. We also study whether knowledge acquisition depends on exposure to media and partisanship, and whether it influences electoral preferences.	Noam Lupu, Luis Schiumerini	NA
2019	84997	395	Rural Deprivation, Local Government Efficiency, and Populist Radical Right Party Support	This study investigates the role of political deprivation in rural areas (i.e., perception that political elites are unresponsive to the concerns of the non-urban population) for the electoral success of populist radical right parties. Specifically, we argue that the strength of the relationship between rural deprivation and the propensity of voting radical right is moderated by local government efficiency—that is, the capability of local administrations to convert resources (e.g., money, staff) into specific outputs (e.g., public transport, schooling, elderly care). This proposition is tested using information on local voting success of the Alternative für Deutschland in the German federal election 2017, local demographic data, and an indicator on local government efficiency derived from cost efficiency models that link resource use and relevant outputs of German municipalities. Results from regression models (with controls and state fixed effects) suggest that local government efficiency attenuates the relationship between rural deprivation and populist radical right support. Areas undergoing socio-demographic and structural-economic decline would benefit from efficient local administrations as they mitigate political deprivation as motivating factor of radical right support.

2019	85958	679	Mount Isa to Mainstream: The saliency of populism in post-Howard Australia	References to ‘African gang crime’ by Australian Federal Minister Peter Dutton and a speech calling for a ‘final solution’ on immigration matters by then Katter Australian Party Senator Fraser Anning, suggest that populist language is ubiquitous in the current discourse of Australian federal politics. Illuminated by perceptions of violent behavior perpetrated by ethnic minorities, emerging politicians have sought to capitalise on a simmering disquiet among sections of the anglo-celt majority. This paper draws from the public statements of both Dutton and Anning to determine if they can be codified within the existing minimalist (Mudde & Kalwasser, 2013a) and exclusionary (Betz, 2004; Ceuppens, 2006; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2013b) definitions of populism. It then revisits the ‘mainstreaming’ scholarship that was a consequence of Pauline Hanson’s first term of office (Moffitt & Snow, 2012; Mondon, 2013; Wear, 2008) to consider how it might be applied since the 2016 Australian Federal Election.

2019	86419	1006	Cordon Sanitaire or Uneasy Alliance? The Electoral Consequences of Populist Participation in Goverment	The paper examines whether including populist political parties in government coalitions has an impact on their future electoral prospects. According to the theory on party strategy developed by Meguid (2008), this is an accommodating strategy and we expect they will decrease their vote shares after their participation in the executive. Contrary to that, it could be argued that reaching the government makes the issues they own more salient and, above all, leads voters to perceive them as more legitimate. In order to address this question, we take the Chapel Hill surveys to identify populist political parties and analyse the cases of coalition governments that formed in Europe when non-populist parties needed to decide whether to ostracise populists or incorporate them into the government. The effect is conditioned by the electoral system of a country and the level of ideological polarization of the party system. The findings suggest that non-populist parties hinder the rise of populism by including them in coalitions, which has ultimately important consequences for the future of representative democracy in Europe.

2019	86115	777	Attitudes toward immigration and the effectiveness of state institutions	In recent years, immigration has become one of the central issues of the political debate in many Western democracies. Given the importance attributed to immigration in shaping political preferences at several recent elections, it is crucial to understand the factors affecting citizens' opinions in this domain. However current individual explanations of immigration attitudes, largely focused on out-group attitudes or perceived sociotropic threat, tend to ignore people's beliefs about the state's ability to effectively manage migratory inflows, turning a potential threat into an opportunity. We theorize that an important factor affecting individuals' attitudes toward immigration is their trust in state institutions. We derive observable implications of our theory by looking at corruption, as a proxy for state functioning, and the overall effectiveness of state institutions. We test our expectations using comparative cross-sectional data from the Eurobarometer and the European Social Survey. Preliminary findings show that higher degrees of corruption in a country, as well as higher perceived corruption by individual respondents, are associated with their tendency to perceive immigration as a problem rather than an opportunity.

2019	86365	963	Party influences and educational effects on public opinion about immigration	Political competition in Europe has been fundamentally transformed by mobilization of immigration and other cultural issues (e.g. Kriesi et al., 2006). Studying the drivers of public opinion about immigration facilitates understanding developments like Brexit or recent national elections. Research on public opinion points to the influence of party cues on public preferences (e.g. Zaller, 1992). At the same time, an education cleavage increasingly separates citizens with libertarian values from those holding authoritarian values (Stubager, 2009). What is less studied is how cross-pressured citizens, i.e. citizens receiving party cues that are incongruent with values arising from their education, form attitudes toward immigration. This study explores this question, relying on statistical methods for time-series cross-sectional data. References Kriesi H, Grande E, Lachat R, et al.

This question is important in order to understand the degree of local tensions from immigration and has motivated much research on the rise of such parties. In this paper we conduct a systematic review of the causal inference literature on this question. We collect more than 130 estimates from 17 studies to calculate a meta-estimate of the relationship. Next we study the correlation between reported estimates and their precision to examine the degree of reporting bias in the literature. Finally, we do a systematic analysis of heterogeneity in estimates according to type of immigration, elections, and research method.	Henning Finseraas	NA
2019	86565	1129	Do Integration Programs Improve Social Integration?	Many European countries have implemented integration programs to improve the social integration of newly arrived immigrants. To what extent these programs are successful in achieving this goal is hard to evaluate because they tend to be implemented in a manner that makes it diﬃcult to identify a comparison group. Moreover, evaluations tend to be restricted to studying labour market outcomes, which provides an incomplete picture of social integration. We employ rich administrative data to study the long-term eﬀect of the Norwegian Introductory Program on political participation and naturalization. We exploit that the program was implemented so that immigrants arriving after September 1, 2003 had a right to participate in the program, while those arriving before did not. Using various techniques to control for diﬀerences between late and early arrivals, we study effects on labour market integration, naturalization, and voter turnout.	Henning Finseraas	NA
2019	85768	567	God and the Ballot Box: Evidence from Victorian Britain	To understand the contemporary political landscape, the emergence of identity politics and the transient nature of such identities are important considerations. The rise and practice of religious voting in Victorian Britain are significant. The class cleavage has been shown to be an important determinant of voter behaviour, and yet, its emergence is rooted in this religious conflict. More so, to some extent, religious polarisation continues to define voting behaviour today. However, we know little of what the patterns of Victorian religious voting looked like. The lack of empirical evidence is due to the cost and difficulty in collecting the relevant individual and aggregate data. This paper fills the gap by using data from the 1851 religious census, poll books, and church membership documents. The data shows that a religious cleavage emerged in the 19thcentury, and confirms the divide between Anglicans and Nonconformists. However, I challenge the notion that this began to dissipate at the end of the century. This identifies the strength of religious polarisation and questions the primacy of other cleavages in determining political identity in modern Britain.	Samuel Mellish	NA
2019	86014	701	THE LONG SHADOW OF THE CROSS: RELIGION AND VOTING DURING FRANCE’S THIRD REPUBLIC	We revisit the structure of electoral and legislative preferences in under France’s Third Republic employing original geocoded data (at the subdepartmental level) from the French revolution, diocesan surveys on religious practice, census data, electoral results, and voting behavior of legislators in the Chamber of Deputies. French electoral voting behavior and the ideological positions of parliamentarians were strongly related to religious practice, which could be traced back to the (geographically heterogeneous) impact of the French Revolution on religious beliefs and practices. The findings confirm macrosociological theories à la Lipset and Rokkan (1967) and cast doubts on alternative theories that insist on the role of geography (Siegfried 1906), property (Sutherland 1983), on the fully autonomous agency political elites (Kalyvas 1986): French politicians chose to intensify the clerical divide at some points in time but they did embedded in a historically-given cleavage. The findings speak to theories of party formation (Lipset and Rokkan 1967, Cox 1997), the new literature on religion and welfare state preferences (Rodden, Huber) and research on the stickiness of political identities (Achen and Bartels 2016).

2019	86038	718	How Voter and Candidate Religiosity Affect Vote Choices: Experimental Evidence from Turkey	Religiosity is linked to voting behavior in the Muslim-majority contexts. Most studies focus on the party’s religiosity, ignoring the variation in candidate religiosity, although parties may have candidates with various levels of religiosity. Missing is a study that investigates the effect of candidate’s religiosity on how voters perceive her, regardless of her party affiliation. Also, the effect of candidate policy positions on candidate evaluation and vote choice are understudied. In this study, we analyze the results from a conjoint survey experiment in Turkey. Each respondent was shown a video of a hypothetical legislative candidate’s speech. 6 different characteristics of the candidate (religiosity, age, political experience, education and 2 policy positions) are manipulated across the respondents. The outcomes we measure are voters’ evaluation of the hypothetical candidate in the video. The results of the conjoint analysis indicate that there is an interaction between the voters’ religiosity and the candidate’s religiosity even when party ID is of the candidate is not clear. Furthermore, policy positions matter regardless of the candidate’s or the respondent’s religiosity.	Yusuf Magiya	NA
2019	86065	737	Religiosity and political participation - some evidence from Poland	There has been much research studying the impact of religious beliefs and practices on political turnout. Yet, as the existing research has shown the relationship in question is far from clear, often due to the problems with the data and a number of confounding factors. In this paper we use a unique dataset on Poland to provide causal estimates of religious attendance on voters’ participation in the local elections. We work with roughly 2,500 observations at the municipal level and our data span the period 1998-2008. To analyze the impact of religiosity on political participation, we follow two strategies. First, we use the difference-in-differences strategy. Second, we adopt an instrumental variables approach. For that purpose we use novel instruments measuring the share of sacral monuments and the share of streets with the names associated with the Church. Our results robustly show that in municipalities with greater religious attendance (lower pace of secularization) the voters’ turnout during the election at the local level has been larger.

2019	87219	1244	The Conceptualization and Measurement of Religion in Public Opinion Research	The gold standard for measuring religious affiliation in public opinion research is commonly labeled 'Reltrad.' The concept and measure have come under close scrutiny in recent years. This paper is both a conceptual and measurement effort that attempts to provide guidance for scholars attempting to come to grips with the impact of religion on political behavior. It builds on past efforts (Kellstedt et al. 1996; Steensland et al. 2000; Smidt et al. 2009; and Woodberry et al. 2012) and attempts to refine these efforts in light of increased arguments that religion is in decline. The conceptual portions of the paper have implications for the study of religion in comparative perspective. The empirical parts of the paper make use of data from surveys in the United States: the American National Election Studies; the General Social Surveys; Voter Surveys from the Democracy Fund; Comparative Congressional Elections Studies; as well as surveys from the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute.

2019	86406	995	Revisiting the Linz-Moreno question. Identities, causal antecedents and support for secession	The Linz-Moreno question has become the most popular measure to assess how national/regional identities affect support for secession in stateless nations. The empirical evidence gathered until today clearly shows that the more regional (in contrast to national) an individual feels, the higher the likelihood of supporting the region’s independence. In parallel, an individual’s origin, the knowledge of the regional language have also been shown to determine his/her support for secession. In this research note, we combine these two narratives and argue that the literature has hitherto missed a proper conceptualisation of how the regional/national identity is related to the other correlates of support for secession. Using data from Catalonia, the Basque Country, Scotland and Quebec, and a Causal Mediation Analysis, our results show that the origin and the knowledge of the regional language are strong antecedents of the national/regional identity, while the direct impact of these variables trough identity is rather small. We further explode the heterogeneity of results across regions, and we discuss the implications of our finding.	Marc Guinjoan	NA
2019	86542	1109	Ethnic boundaries in Catalonia: how geography matters	While the reference to 'ethnic' in Western contexts has been usually applied only to regional parties with a territorial agenda, the closer study of a case such as Catalonia during the last years offers the opportunity to assess whether processes of ethnic (re)alignment affects both state-wide and regional parties competing in subnational arenas. The departing hypothesis is that the territorial distribution of population affects in a pervasive manner how voters align along ethnic lines in polarized contexts. Relying on observational data from elections and census for more than 5.000 administrative sections into which Catalonia is divided for the last electoral cycle, the research combines geographical regression methods with ecological inference techniques. Theoretically, the research combines an approach based on the notion of ethnic boundaries with threat and contact effects from contextual approaches, exploring whether this combination results in significant intra-group variations depending on the environment where individuals live.

2019	86364	962	To Fight or to Vote: Sovereignty Referendums as Strategies in Conflicts over Self-Determination	Subnational groups employ a variety of strategies to contest the government. While democratic states offer a broader array of access options, autocratic regimes are more difficult to contest relying on conventional means. Yet, conventional strategies are common in both democratic and autocratic systems. Under what conditions do subnational groups employ conventional politics? Our argument is that groups playing by the rules signal legitimacy and reliability, thereby making diplomatic appeals for support to the international community more credible. Sovereignty referendums by groups demanding autonomy or independence address a salient identity issue and, as a focal point, allow for domestic and international mobilization in a system where contestation is challenging. Employing survival analysis techniques, we investigate the relevance of contestants’ international diplomacy for subnational sovereignty referendums on a global scale since 1990. We assess the internal validity of the proposed mechanism based on expert interviews for the 2017 independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan. Our findings demonstrate that referendums are indeed associated with greater international involvement, suggesting that transnational diplomacy is critical for the choice of conventional strategies in authoritarian regimes.

2019	86057	732	Party competition and signaling to regional constituencies: Evidence from co-sponsorship networks in Portugal	Portugal's closed list proportional electoral system makes parties dominant players in the determination of candidates. The parties face a trade-off between maintaining party unity and gaining votes by allowing regional candidates to defect from the party line. We analyze this trade-off using co-sponsorship networks from 1986-2016. We propose a new measure for regional cooperation and use spatial regression models to analyse the decision-making structure. We show that, close to elections, government parties allow more regional initiatives from districts where they did poorly in the last election. Opposition parties are more likely to allow regional initiatives as a signal to voters in their strongholds.	Patricia Calca	NA

We do so using data from an online survey that was conducted during the course of the 2017 Dutch parliamentary election campaign and coincided with the events surrounding the stand-off. In particular we look at the effect on party leader evaluations, as well as political attitudes and vote intentions, and conduct a number of robustness checks aimed to deal with issues with regards causal inference and external validity.

2019	86148	802	Do Democracies Select More Experienced Leaders? A Latent-Variable Measurement Approach to Political Experience	One of the central concepts in the study of leadership, particularly in international relations, is that of individual experience. More experienced leaders handle crises more competently; they are less likely to be tested by adversaries. There is a significant amount of conceptual stretching and proxy-ing for experience and related concepts of age, competence and tenure. We are motivated by two main aims. First, we explain the concept of experience so it is empirically useful. Because experience in politics is a multifaceted concept, we account for duration of experience in politics, the quality of experience, and its breadth. Second, drawing on a novel data set of 2,000 leaders from 1950 to 2017 and using a Bayesian latent variable model, we develop a new measurement tool of political experience. We then apply a new measure to explain an apparent rise of inexperienced leaders in democracies. We find that while democracies select more experienced leaders, over time the difference with non-democracies has declined. We also replicate several conflict studies that relied on age or tenure as proxies for experience with our measure instead.	Alexander Baturo	NA
2019	86615	1170	A Changing Agenda: The Impact of Leadership Shifts on Party Manifestos	Previous work on platform formation shows that shifts in leadership alter voter perceptions of party positions, but we know little about how leaders shape their party’s platform. We want to pause and ask what leads to changes in platforms? We argue one important contributor is leadership changes. These changes occur when there is divergence between the electorate and a party’s stated preferences. Given that a platform’s purpose is to set the agenda of a party, we argue that leadership change will result in alterations to manifestos. Using text analysis, we measure changes in manifestos as the variety and salience of issues addressed and positioning on those issues. Using manifestos from 1965-2013 in Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, we incorporate data from O’Brien (2015) on party leadership changes and quantitatively trace major shifts on issues. We expect type- mainstream/niche- status- Government/Opposition- and intra-party institutional structures play a role in moderating the effect of leadership shifts on manifesto changes. Our findings suggest that leadership changes result in issue emphasis shifts of content in manifestos.	Christine Sylvester	NA
2019	86400	990	Reevaluating leader effects on vote choice using quantitative textual analysis	The impact of party leaders on vote choice has for long been an issue in electoral studies, especially under proportional representation rules. This paper develops a hypothesis that information emphasis on leader vis-à-vis party ideology influence voters to think about certain aspects of the party, which will in turn affect vote choice. The leader effect is supposed to be greatest for large parties, where so-called “strategic sequencing”, i.e. voting for a party that is more likely to hold position as Prime Minister, is extra salient. Conducting a framing experiment during the 2018 Swedish General Election campaign and performing statistical latent semantic analyses of voters’ word descriptions of leaders, parties and issues lends support to the overarching hypothesis.

2019	85912	657	Voters’ perceptions of female representation within political parties	While parties have a large role in influencing both the descriptive and substantive representation of women, much less is known of how voters perceive parties' efforts to promote female candidates. We have some evidence that, on an aggregate level, voters value equal descriptive representation of men and women in parliaments. Meanwhile, research has shown that left-leaning parties are much more likely than right-leaning parties to nominate female candidates. Using a single vignette survey experiment in five European countries, I show that voters prefer equal descriptive representation of men and women in political parties. However, this effect is strongly mediated by ideology: left-leaning voters discount parties that are dominated by men while right-leaning voters do not exhibit strong preferences for gender representation. Additionally, having a female lead candidate can even out low female descriptive representation. These findings have important implications for research on women’s representation: they help to explain the different share of female candidates between left- and right-leaning parties and enhance our understanding of the role of party leadership for the perception of women’s representation among the public.

2019	85005	397	Making Politics Male Again? Inclusion, Exclusion, and Political Ambition	As political institutions become more inclusive, a robust literature has examined how the presence of women representatives affects the political engagement and ambition of American women. Yet, a more inclusive polity may also affect the attitudes and behavior of the historically dominant group: American men. To test how messages of inclusion or exclusion foster political ambition, we conduct a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of 1200 U.S. citizens. We vary exposure to “two-minute civics lessons,” videos that depict either an all-male group or a gender-balanced group of early American political leaders. Contrary to our expectations, we find only very weak evidence that messages of inclusion foster women’s political ambition. Yet, we find strong responses from men. Messages that highlight the contributions of America’s “founding fathers” significantly increase men’s political ambition, a trend driven by white men and Republican men. We discuss how our findings speak to the current political moment, in which messages of men performing great deeds resonate with members of historically dominant groups.	Amanda Clayton	NA
2019	86084	753	Gender, Candidate Nomination, and Voter Support	This paper analyzes the interplay of gender, the selection of parliamentary candidates, and voting behavior. Extant research shows that voters engage in same-gender voting: Men tend to support male candidates whereas women tend to support females. Voters can, however, only engage in same-gender voting if parties field viable candidates of the same gender. Intra-partisan bias toward fielding male candidates in promising races hence undermines women’s capacity of casting strategically rational votes for female candidates. We test this argument and seek to identify the extent to which it materializes by analyzing gender-specific candidate selection and candidate voting in the 2010 and 2015 UK general elections. We jointly model parties’ propensity of fielding female candidates and (female) voters’ probability of voting for female candidates contingent on candidates' chances of winning. Multi-wave panel data from the UKHLS allows us to supplement observational analyses with quasi-experimental evidence. Our results and accompanying simulations yield important implications for the representation of women in parties and in parliaments alike.	Denis Cohen, Jochen Rehmert	NA
2019	86132	789	How do Gender and Disability Intersect in Candidate Evaluations?	Research on candidate evaluations suggests that voters evaluate women differently from men with regard to their personality traits, issue competencies, and political ideology. Yet, little is known about how gender and disability intersect in influencing voters’ perceptions of candidates. Based on extant theories and evidence, we argue that gender and disability not only have additive effects on voters’ evaluations but also interact to produce specific stereotypes towards disabled female candidates. We also suspect that having a disability or contact with disabled people weakens the role of stereotypes. We conduct a conjoint experiment among a representative sample of the UK public (N=1,500) to test how candidates’ gender and disability shape voters’ perceptions of candidates as competent, compassionate, and progressive on policy issues. Respondents evaluate two hypothetical candidates with randomly assigned values on various dimensions including gender and disability. The findings provide new insights into how voters make choices and to what extent female candidates with disabilities are subject to unique attitudinal barriers when seeking elected office, which might help explain their overwhelming political under-representation.

2019	86592	1153	Party Nominations and Female Electoral Performance: Evidence from Germany	What accounts for difference in electoral performance between male and female candidates? We introduce a novel decomposition strategy to distinguish between discrimination by voters and discrimination by parties in the candidate nomination process. In doing so, we exploit the unique features of the German electoral system, where voters simultaneously cast votes for a party and for a candidate in their constituency. Using a panel of over 80,000 electoral precincts in the five most recent elections, we establish two findings: First, female district candidates nominated by the center-right CDU and the center-left SPD perform worse than their male counterparts. Second, the difference in performance is driven by party nomination strategies: The CDU and the SPD systematically nominate female candidates in districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for women to win those districts. In comparison, discrimination by voters accounts for a comparatively small part of the overall difference in electoral performance. Our findings have important implications for research on underrepresentation of women in politics, as they face an uphill battle to perform well in weaker districts.	Hanno Hilbig	NA
2019	84633	335	Feeling for War? How Anger and Fear Regulate Casualty Responsiveness	Extant research suggests that people rationally weigh the potential costs and benefits when deciding whether to support a military conflict. Importantly, as the prospects of casualties increase, public support for war decreases. Yet, we know little about why people sometimes are more or less concerned about casualties. Drawing on psychological research, we argue that the extent to which people are affected by information about casualty risks depends on their emotions of anger and fear. Specifically, we hypothesize that citizens become less responsive to casualties when experiencing anger in contrast to fear. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally prime anger and fear with treatment material unrelated to war. Afterwards we present respondents with an armed conflict scenario in which the risk of casualties is either high or low. The results corroborate our theoretical expectations. This research has implications for our understanding of when the public is willing to support conflicts with many lives on the line. Moreover, the findings suggest that elites could muster public support for war by stirring up public anger while tempering public fear.	Casper Sakstrup	NA
2019	85309	447	Is It Really that Bad? Depression, Negativity Bias, and Political Evaluations	Several studies from political science, political communication and political psychology find evidence of negativity in democratic politics. We contribute to this vast literature and propose an additional source of negativity bias: depression. Depression is one of the most common mental health issues and has been found to affect voting and political participation more broadly. Research on cognition and depression theorises and demonstrates that depressed persons exhibit negative biases in the way they collect and process information. We argue that such biases may also apply to how individuals with depression assess politics. Thus we hypothesise that depressed persons evaluate political issues more negatively than non-depressed persons and test this expectation by using data from the European Social Survey. Our paper has important implications for political engagement and political efficacy.	Luca Bernardi	NA
2019	85370	469	The dark side of the dark side - effects of narcissism on support for radical right parties	Existing research shows that narcissism is associated with outgroup-derogation, prejudice, and anti-immigrant sentiments. In this study, we extend this perspective to preferences for radical right-wing populist parties. We argue that narcissism is linked to support for radical right-wing populist parties via authoritarian attitudes. Using large scale survey data from Germany, we investigate the association between narcissistic admiration, narcissistic rivalry, social dominance orientation, rightwing authoritarianism, anti-immigrant sentiments, and preferences for the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The results reveal that narcissistic rivalry is positively associated with preferences for the AfD, while narcissistic admiration is negatively associated with support for the German far right, and that these relationships are essentially mediated via rightwing authoritarianism and anti-immigrant sentiments. These associations are robust against socio-demographic and structural differences, as well as differences in general ideology. With these findings, we provide further evidence for the dimensionality of narcissism and its multifaceted consequences.	Carl Berning	NA
2019	86229	863	What if Citizens Have Too Much Compassion or an Empathy Deficit? Explaining Political Attitudes and Behavior with Empathic Ability	Empathy plays a foundational role in morality and some argue that a lack of empathy is to blame for today's toxic political environment. Empathetic reactions emerge early in life and are modulated by interpersonal and contextual factors, especially group membership. Yet surprisingly little research has been undertaken to empirically asses if individual differences in empathic ability can explain political attitudes and behavior. This paper addresses this lacuna by identifying the effects of empathy in the context of two General Elections and two national referendums in the United Kingdom. Empathy is measured with a battery of ten items for 7691 respondents. The results demonstrate that empathic ability is a consistent predictor of attitudinal and behavioral differences between citizens, such as ideology, strength of partisan identity, interest in politics, turnout, political efficacy, candidate evaluation, policy preferences, happiness with referendum outcomes, and trust in MPs. Remarkably, the empathy scale used in this paper is better at predicting a number of attitudes and behaviors than the five-factor model, which has important consequences for the study of the effects of personality traits in political psychology.

2019	76036	34	Breaking Point?: Examining the Impact of Immigration on the Brexit Vote	Recent research suggests that the Brexit vote was motivated by local deprivation, the rhetoric of the campaign, and attitudes toward immigrants. However, it is difficult to untangle the causal relationship among these factors. In this paper, we try to better understand this relationship by drawing on a unique dataset which surveyed residents in some of the most deprived areas in the U.K. immediately following the election. In the first part of the analysis, we adjudicate among the main mechanisms theorized to link attitudes toward immigrants and the Leave vote. We find that individuals who expressed racist or nationalist views were more likely to vote Leave, whether in areas with high levels of unemployment and/or poor services, or not. In the second part, we examine open-ended questions to try to understand whether these views and attitudes were influenced by the media and Leave campaigns. We find that regardless of local conditions, concerns about the impact of immigration seemed to echo the rhetoric of the campaign, which we suggest stoked latent anti-immigrant prejudice and led people to vote Leave.

2019	78491	75	Places matter: the importance of local attachment on Brexit support	How does the local connect to the politically radical? The literature on the political effects of people’s local attachment is still very scarce. In this study, I provide accounts of whether and how locally oriented factors can motivate support or concerns about Brexit. I understand local indicators as encompassing both objective features in line with economic/immigration factors and subjective features that relate to community identity and belonging. Drawing from the real-world situation of Brexit, I use a survey experiment that exposes treated respondents with negative and positive implications of Brexit on local areas while leaving the control group with nationwide effects only. I find that treated respondents are more locally concerned about economic and social effects of Brexit than the control group no matter their position towards Brexit nor the content of the message. This brings evidence that we cannot evaluate voting behaviour without considering the community experiences’ identities in which individuals find themselves.	Diane Bolet	NA
2019	84434	312	Emotional reactions to referendums and domestic vote choice	How do extraordinary political events shape subsequent electoral outcomes? Drawing on literature on citizens’ emotional reactions to terrorist attacks and natural disasters, we argue that voters’ emotional reactions to such events influence whether they are likely to re-think their prior vote choice as a consequence. We focus on the Brexit referendum as a prominent example of such an event, and examine the effect of people’s emotional reactions to it on their incumbent support in the 2017 UK general election. We expect this effect to be conditional on how people voted in the referendum. Among ‘Leavers’, enthusiasm should increase the propensity to vote Conservative; among ‘Remainers’, anger should decrease the propensity to vote Conservative, while fear should increase prior loyalties. Turnout levels may also be related to emotional reactions, with enthusiasm fostering turnout among ‘Leavers’, while anger should have similar effects among ‘Remainers’. We test these expectations using a voter study conducted by YouGov in 2017. Our paper contributes to understanding how extraordinary events and emotional reactions lead to longer-term electoral shifts.	Sofia Vasilopoulou, Markus Wagner	NA
2019	84937	385	Forgive or Forget? Deservingness After Brexit	Public opinion about government programs is thought to hinge heavily on perceptions of the perceived deservingness of program beneficiaries. Almost all research on these kinds of judgements has therefore focused on personal attributes, like sex, race, or unemployment, that diminish perceived deservingness. Recent theoretical explanations for deservingness judgments are rooted in the psychology of in-group reciprocity and punishment of group members perceived as lazy. We suggest that deservingness judgements can also be colored by political attributes of potential beneficiaries, with political out-groups seen as less deserving than in-groups, all else constant. Amidst Britain's ongoing process of leaving the European Union as a context, we use a nationally representative survey experiment to measure in-group and out-group deservingness. We find that not only political viewpoints but also participation in the referendum vote, drive judgments of deservingness. These results suggest that deservingness judgments can be tied not only to perceived contributions to small-group welfare but also large-scale political choices and actions.	Sara Hobolt	NA
2019	86470	1046	United Kingdom and United Europe: The implications of Brexit for continued unity	As the Brexit outcome appears increasingly unappealing, some observers have suggested that Scotland could opt to secede and join the European Union (EU) as a separate nation, while Northern Ireland might decide to merge with the Republic of Ireland. While neither outcome appears likely, Brexit does raise a stark question for the populations of Scotland and Northern Ireland: do they feel more of a sense of shared identity and destiny with England, or with Ireland and the other EU member states? This paper uses automated text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, to compare newspaper coverage of the EU in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, as well as mutual coverage of one another. I analyze tens of thousands of articles to identify patterns in the tone and framing of coverage. I further compare the results to voting patterns in the Brexit referendum and the Scottish independence referendum of 2014. The findings will offer key insights into the implications of Brexit for the UK’s continued unity.	Maurits van der Veen	NA
2019	83962	254	The Effect of Leaders on Coalition Governments: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment	Most studies on the formation of political coalitions focus on parties’ office-seeking and policy-seeking motivations, as well as on the institutions that favour alliance-building. However, existing explanations cannot explain many observed political coalitions. Thus far, politicians’ personal characteristics have been ignored as potential drivers of coalition formation. This paper asks whether politicians prefer to form political coalitions with individuals who share relevant individual characteristics (the homophily principle). To test this idea, this paper conducts a conjoint experiment included in a survey of 900 Spanish mayors, in order to reveal a causal relationship between similarities in socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and education) and the willingness to form a coalition; as well as the mechanisms that explain why individual characteristics might matter. The experiment evaluates how politicians make decisions in certain situations by having them select a would-be governing partner from two randomly-varied candidate profiles. The experimental data shows that personal characteristics have a causal role in defining some combinations of coalitions between similar leader profiles and demonstrates a specific mechanism through which they can affect leaders’ choices in decision-making processes.

2019	86428	1013	Compensational Voting and Perceptions of Power Sharing Among Voters	The compensational-vote model provides a parsimonous yet comprehensive theory of decision making among voters. In her seminal contributions, Kedar (2005, 2009) proposes that voters in contexts with power sharing (e.g., coalitions) make choices based on their expectations of policy outcomes rather than their ideological proximity to parties. While existing empirical tests provide support for the theory, they rely on the assumption that voters' perceptions of power sharing are fixed in a given country. This paper reexamines the compensational-vote model by allowing perceptions of power sharing to vary among voters. We field survey questions in 12 European countries which for the first time directly measure voters' expectations of power sharing (expected vote shares), government composition, and policy outcomes (expected position of the government). This allows us to test whether and when voters entertain a naïve view of power sharing, which considers the shares of all parties in parliament, against a sophisticated view of power sharing, where voters also incorporate expectations about government composition and compromise in their decisions. Our findings have important implications for voter behavior and party strategies.	Mariyana Angelova	NA
2019	87896	1252	Making and Breaking Coalitions: The Influence of Prosociality and Rationality	From a traditional rational choice perspective, coalitions are inherently unstable if the collective decision involves a distributional conflict. While traditional explanations for the empirical stability of coalitions refer to institutions, more recent theoretical developments argue that behavioral traits like actors' prosociality and rationality have stabilizing effects. The aim of this project is to provide a first empirical test of this theoretical claim. In a laboratory experiment, we first gather information on subjects' prosociality and rationality. Then subjects are matched into three-person groups based on their revealed behavior in the previous part of the experiment and play a real-time coalition formation game. Preliminary results suggest that the existence of even allocations can indeed be explained by prosocial preferences. Prosocial subjects are more likely to agree on even allocations and those allocations are more likely to sustain. This indicates that institutions are at least not the only driving factor behind stable coalitions.	Manuel Schwaninger	NA
2019	83921	247	When does cheating matter? Electoral malpractice and political trust in democracies and autocracies	Electoral malpractices seem to be on the rise almost everywhere. While compromising legitimacy from a normative point of view, we know little about the consequences electoral malpractice has for empirical legitimacy. This paper proposes a negative effect of electoral malpractice on political trust that is contingent on the type of political system. It argues that regime type affects both the relevance citizens ascribe to the freedom and fairness of elections and the extent to which citizens can become aware of electoral malpractices. In autocracies, for one, citizens might – based on past experience – already expect some irregularities surrounding the electoral process and thus not be as sensitive to violations of electoral integrity as citizens in democracies. Second, citizens in autocracies are also less likely to become aware of electoral malpractices due to limitations on media freedom. We would therefore expect a stronger negative effect of electoral malpractice in more democratic regimes. Combining V-Dem data on the electoral process with survey data for more than 100 democracies and autocracies, this paper tests its propositions using multi-level structural equation modeling.

2019	86046	723	Vote buying as a signaling game and its experimental evidence	The implicit assumption that voters’ perceptions of political machines’ monitoring capacity are static, independently of the provision of private transfers, has heavily guided the development of the vote-buying literature. We challenge this assumption with a formal model of vote buying as a signaling game, in which a voter is uncertain about the politician’s monitoring capacity before observing her provision decision. We characterize a separating equilibrium in which the politician offers a private transfer only when she is equipped with monitoring technology, increasing the voter’s belief about her monitoring capacity and making vote buying effective. Experimental results verify the separating equilibrium; politicians’ provision of private transfers enhances voters’ belief about the politicians’ monitoring capacity, whereas the lack of private transfers weakens this belief. The main substantive insight of the model is that, by providing private transfers, a politician can effectively change the voters’ beliefs about her ability to monitor voter behavior at the polls. Therefore, even when institutions make monitoring vote choices unfeasible, politicians can buy votes as long as small doubt about ballot secrecy remains in voters’ minds.	Sergio Ascencio	NA
2019	86526	1095	Political Lie Detection	Does citizens have the ability to judge when politicians lie to them, accurately judging the veracity of what politicians say and discerning true from false statements? In short, does the truth matter? I elicit truth perceptions in a novel statement rating task, asking respondents to judge the veracity of real statements from politicians, and I experimentally investigate how the availability of source cues affect these perceptions. Comparing perceptions to the evaluations of an independent, fact-checking organization, I find that perceptions track the truth. While source cues increase polarization, they do not substantially diminish this relationship, except in the case of highly polarizing speakers. Overall, the results suggest that political lie detection is possible through the aggregation of individual perceptions, even in the face of formidable partisan forces.	Jonathan Woon	NA
2019	86459	1037	Detecting electoral manipulation in a consolidated democracy: RDD evidence from Spanish local elections	Electoral processes of consolidated democracies are supposedly immune to the manipulation of election results. However, in spite of providing all sorts of guarantees, elections in these countries can still open the door to partisan manipulations that crucially affect their outcomes. Using data from Spanish local elections (1983-2015), we study a high stakes situation: securing the absolute majority of seats in the local council to bypass the negotiation with other parties. We apply a regression discontinuity design to show that certain parties are systematically more likely to obtain just enough votes to seize the pivotal seat than other parties. We show that this is unlikely to be driven by an exceptionally efficient mobilization of voters. We further examine whether this occurs within the election station premises or later on, when contentious votes are scrutinized by hierarchically superior electoral authorities. These findings point at possible flaws of otherwise clean election procedures and have broader implications for our understanding of the quality of consolidated democracies and the capacity of parties to transcend the democratic rules of the game when stakes are high.

2019	85812	594	Childbirth, Early Voting, and Turnout	This paper studies the effect of childbirth on turnout in Swedish elections. Using detailed individual-level data on voting, matched with birth data, we find that childbirth decreases turnout by close to 20 percentage points, and that this decrease is larger among mothers than fathers. We show that parents who anticipate childbirth close to or on election day are substantially more likely to cast an early vote, which counters some of the drop in turnout due to childbirth. Furthermore, the gender gap in turnout due to childbirth is larger among low-skilled parents, which can be explained by high-skill parents being more likely to compensate the anticipated drop in turnout by casting an early vote. These results demonstrates how early voting maintains high turnout among voters that are unable to cast their vote on election day.	Sirus Dehdari	NA
2019	85945	670	The Dynamics of Turnout Over Two Elections Using ‘Bigger’ Data	Using a large sample of data from the electoral rolls, the census, and official records of voting or not voting, this paper draws on a ‘bigger data’ approach to uncover the dynamics of New Zealand turnout change over two elections, restricting its analysis to those sampled who were on the roll for both the 2014 and 2017 elections. In particular, we seek to test the relative significance individualist and social explanations for the turnout dynamic by way of changes in household composition, and changes in the context of electoral competition.

2019	86187	834	Policymaking and Financial Gains in the United Kingdom Parliament	The Panama Papers and the MP expenses scandal reveal a breathtaking amount of wealth accumulation by political elites. But we still know little about how and why sitting politicians make money. We know even less about the consequences of legislative self-enrichment on the electorate and the policymaking process. I argue that legislators' ability to self-enrich is conditioned by their electoral safety and their ability to influence the policymaking process. I leverage all of the financial interests disclosed by Members of Parliament in the past decade. My initial results indicate that lawmakers' electoral margins and financial interests are positively associated with each other. Moreover, members of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties report more financial financial interests. Further work explores the effect of financial disclosure reports on voters' preferences for Brexit. In an era of self-enriching elites, these findings cast a harsh light on the motivations and ambitions of our political leaders.	Kevin Fahey	NA
2019	86319	927	A Property-Owning Democracy: Does being a Landlord Affect British MPs' Behaviour on Housing Policy?	Access to affordable housing is one of the hottest political issues in the UK. Recent press coverage has highlighted the fact that around one quarter of British MPs are landlords, renting out homes to tenants, and argued that landlord MPs have voted against measures to increase the housing supply and other measures to improve the quality and quantity of rented housing. This paper takes a systematic approach to discovering whether these concerns are true. It combines scraped data from the Register of MPs' Financial Interests going back to the late 1990s with comprehensive data on voting and speeches by MPs on housing policy, asking whether landlord MPs vote and speak distinctively on housing policies compared to other similar non-landlord MPs. Initial results suggest that there is some tendency for landlord MPs to vote and speak against the interests of tenants and non-homeowners. This raises the possibility that MPs are voting to protect their own direct financial interests, skewing housing policy towards the interests of a narrow elite, and that the over-representation of the wealthy in parliament may have policy consequences.

2019	86339	944	From ‘fighting corruption’ to ‘fighting the corrupt elite’? Politicizing corruption within and beyond the populist divide	In Central and Eastern Europe, corruption has become a central issue of electoral campaigns. Initiatives such as Transparency International, the WGI by the World Bank and the European Union have emphasized the fight of corruption as important indicator for government performance, spilling over to opposition campaigns and political debates. More recently, however, the topic corruption has gained momentum on different terms. Populist parties praise ‘the good people’ and demonize the ‘corrupt political elite’ that do not represent the popular will. In political terms, corruption has become more than the narrow definition of corrupt acts, making the fight of corruption an ambivalent issue. This paper sheds light on the term corruption in electoral campaigns by analyzing how the salience of anti-corruption claims correlates with other party characteristics, and particularly, how the patterns change over time. Using a new expert survey for 41 elections in 11 CEE countries, I show that anti-corruption claims have indeed gained in popularity among (radical) anti-establishment parties, and discuss under which circumstances the fight of corruption has been able to co-exist as issue beyond the populist divide.

2019	86390	983	The Party Room: Donor Networks and Leaders in Congress	How do political relationships define the careers of party leaders? Focusing on party leaders in the United States Congress, this paper builds on the extended party network (EPN) literature by examining the relationship structures that result from campaign contributions. Previous works on elite party relationships have tended to limit their focus to interactions within Congress. Though these works contribute to our understanding of elite relationships, US political parties are comprised of more than just their Congressional divisions, including a wide range of actors outside of formal governing institutions who hold substantial sway over intra-party forums. Historically, Congressional leaders have advanced their careers by drawing on their extensive donor networks for the benefit of their parties. Left unanswered is whether certain individuals are inherently more talented at building political relationships or whether these ties arise simply from holding the positions within leadership. This paper utilizes network analysis to examine how leader-based donor networks evolve over the course of their careers. This allows me to probe whether the relationship networks of leaders emerge prior to their promotion to the leadership team.	Jordan HSu	NA
2019	86429	1014	Prior career as a source of policy expertise: How former profession of British MPs shape their issue attention in the House of Commons	There is a growing literature in legislative studies regarding the determinants of issue attention and policy priorities of legislators. It has been found that policy expertise earned in committees help explain legislator’s focus on particular policy brief. Yet little attention has been paid in the existing literature on another source of policy expertise: the prior profession and experiences of legislators. This paper seeks to explore if legislators’ attention among various policy areas is affected by the amount of prior experience that they have acquired in related professions. A unique data set of MPs prior professional and political career is collect and used to test against their attention on particular policy area in parliamentary debate, which is determined by topic modelling on the corpus of legislative speeches in the 2010-2015 British parliament. The result seeks to demonstrate that MPs’ prior profession does affect the kind of policy area that they focus on once elected to Westminster, which would have implication on the idea of representation based on profession and sectorial interest.

2019	85294	440	How parties choose ministers: Party careers and ministerial portfolio salience in Austria, 1945 – 2018.	Gaining access to government office is essential to political parties. However, once in office, the party has to delegate executive powers to individual ministers, risking a loss of control as ministers might depart from the party line. The more important the ministerial post to fill, the higher the party’s stakes when taking these decisions. While the bulk of the literature on ministerial selection studies the overall selection into cabinet, this paper explores how parties select ministers for individual ministerial portfolios of varying salience. Based on a comprehensive data set on the party and public office careers of Austrian ministers and junior ministers (1945–2018; n=562), the paper finds that ministerial candidates’ party careers are crucial in determining the portfolios allocated to them. However, these effects vary substantially, not only between parties but also over time. In studying the changing role of party careers in ministerial selection, this paper contributes new insights on the intra-party dimension of government formation and on the power relations between the party in central office and the party in public office.

2019	86284	902	Parliaments Day by Day: the Parliamentary Careers in Comparison Core Database	In this paper we present a new publicly available comparative parliamentary database with day-to-day membership data. Many key questions in parliamentary research require an exact image of who was where when. Politicians, however, move around a lot. This renders seemingly simple questions difficult. For example, how many female parliamentarians were represented when or how tenure in parliaments has developed. To alleviate these difficulties this database contains complete, day-by-day membership data for all parliaments, factions and parties in the national parliaments of Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands 1945-2017. This data is highly accurate with a high resolution and is easy to match to existing politician level data and other data platforms like Parlgov, the manifesto-project and CLEA. This database can be used to build new data-sets and improve existing ones. We illustrate the value of high resolution membership data by regenerating often used aggregate measurements like the percentage of women in parliament, average age, seniority and legislative turnover. This reveals small, yet important biases and data errors in several, generally considered authoritative, sources for such aggregate statistics.	Tomas Turner-Zwinkels	NA
2019	86353	954	Political Dynasties in the European Parliament	Political dynasties have been documented in many countries around the world; however, this phenomenon has primarily been studied in national or subnational contexts. The European Parliament, the only directly elected body in the European Union, has held elections since 1979 and provides a political arena that is multi-level and supranational. Does dynastic behavior exist in the same way in supranational politics as it does in national politics? This paper uses a cross national dataset of MEPs in the European Parliament that maps dynastic connections to both legislator careers and electoral outcomes from 1994 until 2014. I find that there are EP dynasties, but that these politicians don’t necessarily behave as EU careerists. Further, I find a significant presence of MEPs with national dynastic links, and these members are less likely to participate in legislative activities. MEP dynasts are almost exclusively composed of national political families, demonstrating that political families are exploiting multi-level political institutions.	Alexandra Cirone	NA
2019	84533	329	Running In Spite of Themselves: Assessing the Impact of Fringe MEP Careers on National Political Party Successes in Europe	Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have the curious opportunity to build political careers that work either outside of or in parallel with their respective national party systems. In addition, the institutional framework of EP electoral institutions and voter behavior provides politicians from smaller and ideologically fringe parties with easier access to elected office than in domestic competitions. Using original biographical data on all MEPs serving since the 1979 EP elections and building upon previous work on the candidates selection strategies of fringe parties at the EP level, I assess the likelihood of a sitting MEP to use their position to then stand for local or national office, as well as examine which of the legislative behaviors demonstrated while serving as an MEP may make them more likely to win such elections. My analysis contributes to a growing literature on the shifting political cleavages in Europe and questions its impact on the career behavior of its politicians. It also works to empirically unpack the diversity of fringe MEPs and their ability to affect national political party competition.	William Daniel	NA
2019	86012	700	Correlated signals in legislative committees: The effect of correlation neglect on committee decision making	Decisions made in legislative committees often involve an exchange of information or signals. Signals with a common source are likely to be correlated. If correlated information is shared in committee deliberation, rational actors account for the correlation in their information updating and end up with unbiased Bayesian beliefs about the state of the world. However, experimental evidence shows that people have problems in accounting for correlation between multiple signals. They neglect the correlation to some degree. I use a formal model of decision making in committees that involves limited deliberation to show how correlation neglect biases beliefs of naïve individuals and affects strategies and decisions of committees. Committee members who treat signals falsely as independent are almost certain to end up in a different belief about the correct decision than those who account for correlation between private signals. Correlation does not alter the voting behavior and information sharing of committee members if they are all from the same type. In committees with both types of individuals, correlation between signals increases incentives for strategic voting and information sharing.	Samuel David Mueller	NA
2019	86505	1076	Congressional Committee Newsworthiness: An Indirect Gauge of Significance	We employ a comparatively new approach to gauging committee importance. Rather than cataloging activities, assessing formal and informal powers, or otherwise studying composition, we outsource the measurement of committee significance to the media. In particular, we gauge significance of Parliamentary Select Committees in the UK, in search of evidence that these have gained in salience and visibility over time. If their actions are reported, they must matter (to readers, viewers and listeners, in the eyes of reporters, editors, etc.) With due attention to important changes in the ease with which media sources are searchable, we document striking variance—across time and space—in the newsworthiness of committees. Defying the skeptical (textbook) view that such committees keep MPs busy, but have no other discernible effects, we find that they have grown in visibility steadily. That point alone does not establish that Governments cannot always or easily ignore Select Committees, but it establishes that they are a plausible vehicle for mobilizing public opinion, and thereby constraining Ministers.

2019	86162	812	Legislative Significance: In the Eye of the Beholder	Over the last decade, political scientists have made use of advances in computational methods which allow sophisticated analyses of large datasets and automation of time-consuming tasks. Machine learning models in particular, have become a mainstay of these methods. Such methods often require ‘labelled’ data for training, with labels generated from sources ranging from a small number of expert coders to crowd-sourced populations of non-experts to labels generated automatically from web data. While each of these sources are valid, they may all label the same data differently. This means that the results of these machine learning models, particularly any prediction we derive from them, vary depending on the source used to label training data. In this paper, we explore how experts and the crowd differ in their estimates of legislative significance for UK statutory instruments (SIs), based on interpretations of the same text. We explore the extent to which these different sources of labelling assign divergent labels of significance to UK SIs, and compare the interpretation of significance to estimates obtained from citations of legislation on the web.

2019	82156	150	Powerful Legislature or Rubber Stamper? A Text Reuse Analysis of Hungarian Bills and Laws	The paper applies the text reuse approach to an analysis of the Hungarian legislative process. The ‘viscosity’ of the Hungarian National Assembly, the extent to which it can constrain the government, is investigated by comparing the text of bills introduced in parliament with that of adopted laws between 1994 and 2018. Our corpus contains 3690 pairs of texts while the database is supplemented by more than two dozen explanatory variables which are used for assessing the structure and extent of legislative power and autonomy. By applying text mining and regression methods, we measure, inter alia, how the introducer of laws, the composition of governing coalitions and polarisation in the party system, or the policy area of the law in question affects the magnitude of deviation from the original text via legislative amendments. Our preliminary results show that bills are modified less when their purpose is the ratification of international agreements, and more if they had been introduced by committees and MPs and not the government. We also find that different legislative cycles are associated with considerable variations in legislative autonomy.	Miklós Sebők	NA
2019	86176	825	Everybody else is doing it, so why can’t we? Text similarities and the diffusion of party policies	While scholars paid much attention to party and issue competition within countries, the diffusion of party policies across borders has only recently gained attention. Few studies look at parties general left-right positions and find that they have an impact on other parties’ policy positions elsewhere. For tracing the diffusion of party policies, we need to zoom in on possible pathways and channels of diffusion, though. As an exploratory step, we take a closer look at the diffusion of ideas on the textual level by pair-wise comparing the similarity of election programs based on the Manifesto Corpus. In a second step, we aim at explaining the (dis-) similarity by taking party characteristics of both the “sender” and the “receiver” into account like common party family, vote gains or losses, and government/opposition status complemented by factors derived from the diffusion literature like temporal or geographic proximity. Our findings show that diffusion among parties is a useful concept that helps to understand how ideas spread around the world. Methodologically, it has also important implications for cross-lingual analyses of manifestos.	Nils Düpont	NA
2019	85315	452	Do Voters Have to Choose Between Political Competence and Descriptive Representation?	Do democracies face a trade-off between descriptive representation and competent leadership? We use a rich dataset covering the entire Danish population, including the universe of Danish candidates for local and national elections over from 1990 to 2013 period to explore selection of political candidates. Specifically, we ask four questions to provide a conceptual replication of previous work in a different context: (i) Are politicians more competent than the general population? (ii) Does such selection reflect social background or selection on individual skills? (iii) Do politicians have social backgrounds that are descriptively representative of the population? (iv) Is there a trade-off between selection on competence and social representation? Following the conceptual replication, we utilize a grand municipality merger, which significantly reduced the number of municipalities and test if an increased political competition affected the social representation and the trade-off between competition and representation.

2019	77305	53	Dyadic Representation in the American North and South: The Case of Prohibition	A persistent question in the study of American political history is whether the one-party, limited-franchise governments in the Jim Crow American South represented their voting citizens. Answering this question has been difficult due to data limitations. In this paper, we circumvent this issue by focusing on an issue---prohibition---for which high-quality data regarding public opinion exists in the form of votes on state-level ballot referenda. Using county-level referendum returns, we create measures of citizen preferences over prohibition at the legislative district level for states in both the South and the non-South. We then examine the relationship between preferences and roll call votes on temperance-related issues in the U.S. House and on votes to ratify the Eighteenth Amendment in state legislatures, comparing the strength of this relationship between the South and non-South. We find that while legislators in the non-South were somewhat more responsive to constituent preference, the relationship in the South was also quite strong. This indicates that, at least on one salient issue, the absence of vibrant two-party competition did not prevent legislative representation in the one-party South.	James Snyder	NA
2019	86351	952	The Politics of Representation and Health Policy in 50 States and 7,383 Districts	How well do the America’s thousands of state legislators represent their constituents? Are the decisions they make in the statehouse reflective of the wishes and needs of their constituents, or do other influences--their own preferences, those of their party, and those of special interests--hold more sway? We don’t have much insight on this representational question because of huge problems in measurement at this level of government. Understanding the receptiveness of individual state legislators and in aggregate to such varied influence will help us to predict the course of coalitions that can be constructed in each state to pass a diverse set of health reform policies. Using the context of state health care policy, I conduct original surveys with tens of thousands of respondents to allow me to estimate district level opinion using MRP, which has hitherto been used at the state level. I also use the newest iteration of my state legislative ideology dataset (Shor and McCarty 2011), along with newly gathered interest group data. These new measures help us to understand representation at this level.	Boris Shor	NA
2019	86225	861	Are ideas present when people aren’t? – The relation of numerical and substantive representation of the poor in European parliaments	According to recent research, legislative decisions systematically neglect low-income citizens. This bias might be explained by parliaments being largely made up of wealthy and highly educated representatives. While empirical evidence confirms that the presence of women and ethnic minorities in parliament significantly enhances the implementation of their preferences, research on the impact of the socio-economic background of MPs is scant. This contribution seeks to fill this void by measuring preference congruence of citizens and political elites with the help of hierarchical regression models using individual-level data from the European Election Study and elite-level data from the Comparative Candidates Survey. On the individual level, the analysis tests whether congruence between citizens and elites is stronger when they share the same socio-economic background. At the aggregate level, the article maintains that the social background of individual MPs has a smaller impact for left-wing parties since those parties traditionally defend the interests of the poor. Diverging levels of congruence have important implications because the numerical underrepresentation of the poor in European parliaments threatens their substantive representation in the political process.

2019	86696	1201	Inter-Party and Intra-Party Threats to Prime Ministerial Survival	The importance of prime ministers in parliamentary democracies is unchallenged. While there are many studies of government survival, prime ministerial survival is by far not as well studied. I provide a framework to study prime ministerial survival. I argue that prime minister replacements by rival parties (inter-party politics) are governed by factors unlike those that drive replacements by the prime minister party (intra-party politics). I show evidence for this claim using competing risk models and data from 20 Western democracies in the period 1951-2014. I find that factors that decrease rival party replacement risk (e.g., PM party is largest party in parliament), increase PM party replacement risk and vice versa. The findings have major implications for the study of governments, prime ministers and political representation.	Roni Lehrer	NA
2019	86097	765	Contested Campaigns? Intra-Party Dissent through Dimensional Dalliance	Politicians with extreme preferences struggle to dictate the content of their parties’ campaigns. Yet, the multi-dimensional nature of EU politics provides members with the opportunity to influence secondary dimensions of politics such as issues related to the EU. We argue that manipulating the salience and tone of debate on secondary issues represents a more viable strategy for internal challenges to the party line. From this perspective, an increase in the salience of EU related issues by fringe party groups is particularly challenging for mainstream parties whom in the past actively tried to decrease the salience of this dimension. We investigate the Twitter communication of MEP candidates for four weeks prior to the 2014 EP elections and national MPs over a period of one year in four EU countries. To measure intra-party dissent, we compare politicians’ estimated left-right positions with the mean party position. We use a machine-learning approach to estimate the salience of EU related issues in politicians’ Twitter communication. Consistent with our expectation the preliminary analysis shows substantial variance in the salience and sentiment of EU issues within parties.	Zachary Greene	NA
2019	86627	1179	Using Social Media Networks of Candidates to Study Intra and Inter-Party Competition in Finland	This paper uses data from the most recent Finnish parliamentary elections to study the relation between inter and intra-party competition, individual electoral success and candidate social media networks. The Finnish electoral system combines open-list proportional representation and mandatory preferential voting. As a consequence, it is characterised by a high degree of intra and inter-party competition. Finnish candidates and representatives are also known to make extensive use of social media channels during electoral campaigns and while in office. Using network analysis and community detection algorithms we compute new measures of inter and intra-party competition based on Finnish candidates’ social media interactions,and compare them to measures previously used in the literature. We analyse the relation between intra and inter-party political competition, candidate behaviour and electoral success by linking the network analysis results to candidate survey data from the Comparative Candidates Survey, as well as district-level characteristics.

2019	86357	957	Lucky Strike: The Effect of Being a Governing-party MP on Individual Electoral Success and Survival	Does holding office improve personal electoral fortunes? So far, most evidence comes from elections that return a single office-holder, leaving unclear the impact of incumbency in multi-member district proportional systems. This lack of knowledge is troubling: in such systems, disentangling personal from party incumbency advantage is methodologically challenging and substantively consequential: candidates compete between and within-parties and face two-layered accountability (constituency and party). We exploit a feature of the Greek electoral system (the 50-seat bonus) that generates quasi-random variation in incumbency: in a quasi-random sample of districts, at least one seat is gifted to the national winner-party irrespective of its performance in that district. Using two different identification strategies (IV and matching), we find that being a bonus-MP has positive effects on both electoral performance and re-selection. We identify a possible mechanism which is conditioned by district magnitude: intra-party competition increases with district magnitude thus forcing incumbents to exert higher public spending effort. Our results are consistent to theories of intra-party competition in open-list PR systems and shed light on the individual underpinnings of incumbency advantage in such systems.

2019	76582	45	Party Factions and Legislative Performance: New Conservatives, Amending Strategy, and Party Loyalty	In this work, we focus on the implications for legislative performance posed by the presence of significant party factions. We explore the extent to which “New Conservatives”—i.e., the Tea Party, Liberty, and Freedom Caucuses—succeeded in shifting policy outcomes rightward by adding conservative amendments to measures that later passed the US House of Representatives. We do so by focusing primarily on data from the 112th through 115th Congresses (2011-2018). We find that while New Conservatives offer many amendments and the House agrees to many of their amendments, there is little evidence that their amendments lead to House passage of legislation that is more conservative than legislation without New Conservative amendments. Our results suggest multiple possible explanations: perhaps, when offering amendments, New Conservatives are more pragmatic than they are sometime credited for being; or perhaps there the process that determines which amendments are voted on is more likely to preclude votes upon, or perhaps even the offering of, New Conservatives’ most conservative amendments. We discuss additional work that might help explain our findings.	Timothy Nokken	NA
2019	85000	396	The influence of problems on political parties’ issue emphasis	Problems such as rising unemployment or increasing poverty constantly emerge which political parties have to tackle. As encapsulated by the notion of parties’ issue ownership and issue voting, the capacity to handle problems is central to political parties’ electoral fortunes, and retrospective performance voting is widespread. Yet, research on how parties respond to problems is very limited. In fact, we know very little systematically on the broader questions about which problems parties propel to the political agenda and which they ignore – even if such questions motivated the initial interest in political agenda setting. We know that political parties in large part decide which policy issues reach the political agenda, but we do not know the logic underlying the problem response. Part of the barrier to such research is that we rarely have detailed and frequent data on parties’ issue emphasis. To overcome this challenge, this paper classifies 25,000 press releases from the multiple parties in the Danish parliament 2004-2017. This allows an analysis of the extent to party competition influences problem responsiveness.	henrik seeberg	NA
2019	83765	240	Discreet Inequality: How Issue Agendas Embrace Privileged Interests	A growing literature documents that the policy output of modern democracy fails to represent the preferences of traditionally marginalized subconstituencies. By dissecting party platforms, I show that the very politicization of issues is already permeated with inequality before democratic decision-making even begins. Issue agendas worldwide predominantly reflect the concerns of male, educated and wealthy voters. That parties disregard large social groups when selecting campaign issues may seem surprising given that agenda setting is inherently public. However, my analysis reveals that looming electoral backlash is anticipated by a strategy of “discreet inequality.” In particular, parties strive to appear inconspicuous and non-threatening by exempting issues from unequal treatment that voters perceive as divisive and/or unpleasant. Discreet inequality thus appeases marginalized groups while ignoring their views on the large majority of more ordinary issues. The paper demonstrates these patterns for gender, education and income using comparative survey and manifesto data covering 42 countries.	Till Weber	NA
2019	85305	446	What's the Talk in Brussels? A Dynamic Measure of Issue Attention at the EU Level	What issues are prevalent in European Union (EU) politics? In this paper we attempt to for the first time answer this question in a rigorous and longitudinal manner by developing a new measure of issue attention at the EU level. Building on recent advances in both metodology and data collection, we deploy a structural topic model to construct a universe of EU-level topics from Agence Europe data for the period 1979-2018, including newly digitized archives. Our measure gives researchers for the first time access to a standardized yardstick of issue attention in EU politics across time. We identify 104 individual topics such as climate change, terrorism or enlargement and the proportional prevalence of each topic at any moment between 1979 and 2018, thus enabling both cross-topic and longitudinal analysis. In the final section of this paper we validate the text-mining results and present an application of the issue attention measure.	Michal Ovadek	NA
2019	86030	711	What Policies to Emphasise? Partisan Welfare Politics in Advanced Capitalism	Post-industrialization has changed labour markets and led to an increased and reconfigured support coalition for the welfare state. Whereas both working and middle class voters are generally supportive of a big welfare state, the former increasingly votes for the radical right and the latter for the left. Faced with broad demand for social policy, we would expect parties to converge on social policy issues. However, this convergence is not to be expected if the overall high support for the welfare state masks underlying divides regarding the priorities different social groups attribute to different types of social policies, in particular investment vs. consumption. Once we account for this divide in priorities, we expect parties to differ in the type of welfare state they advocate. Building on the concept of issue yield, I show that parties strategically promote social policies that are prioritized within their core electorate and among their potential electorate, resulting in the observation that left parties more strongly weight investment, whereas radical right parties emphasise consumption. The analyses combine original data on voters’ social policy priorities with manifesto data.	Michael Pinggera	NA
2019	84831	368	Who gets their way in coalition policy?	This paper analyzes what party features determine the weights parties bear on the government policy compromise. Although, when it comes to cabinets, the literature expects weights to be proportional to seats, Gamson’s law, there is no reason that this translates to policies. This study innovates by directly estimating the bargaining weights. It uses the Comparative Manifesto Project’s unique coding of both parties and government policy position for several Western European countries over half a century. Subsuming the possibility that weights are proportional to seat share, the analysis finds no support for such hypothesis. The paper tests alternative hypotheses and factors that may predict the coalition government’s policy position.	Alessio Albarello	NA
2019	85021	400	Fitting the Odd Parties In—Parties’ Representational Claims and Their Implications for Coalition Formation.	Existing policy-driven theories of coalition formation struggle to explain the inclusion of parties that do not easily fit onto a common policy dimension. This is especially so with parties that do not express positions on the given system’s main issue dimension. Using a new typology of parties based the concept of “representational claims”—what and who parties claim to represent—I argue that we can better understand coalition formation by accounting for parties’ engagement in both the politics of issues (appeals on policy positions) and the politics of identity (appeals to demographic groups). Specifically, I hypothesize that among non-formateur parties, those that emphasize demographic over policy appeals are more likely to be included in coalitions. That is so because a demographic rather than a policy emphasis is assumed to be less costly and because it is easier to accommodate in a variety of minimally connected coalitions. After explaining the party typology and the coalition formation model, I test my hypothesis on the cases of Israel, the Netherlands and Belgium between 1998 and 2017 and discuss the implications of the results.

2019	86590	1152	Are All Coalition Parties Treated the Same? The Costs of Being a Coalition Member in Presidential and Parliamentary Systems	Although there is a broad understanding that taking part in a coalition government is not costless for its members, how these costs are shared among coalition partners is unclear. In this study, we investigate the extent to which each of the coalition members is subject to economic voting. More specifically, we examine whether the system of government (i.e., parliamentary or presidential) has an impact on the economic retrospective vote. Using worldwide coalition data from 1983 to 2015, we test: (1) whether junior partners are punished less severely than senior partners; (2) whether voters treat junior partners differently, and; (3) whether all coalition partners (or only a subset of them) are more likely to lose votes in comparison to opposition parties when economic conditions deteriorate. A better understanding of how voters evaluate each coalition member in presidential and parliamentary systems has the potential to uncover important aspects related to coalition dynamics in both of these systems, such as the incumbency advantage and defections within coalition governments.

2019	84820	367	Patterns of intra-coalition bargaining: Tracing the strategic use of legislative amendments to shape the substance of policy choices	Several studies have recently highlighted the importance of legislative amendments for policing coalition compromises. While providing valuable insights into bargaining interactions within coalition governments, these contributions are characterized by two shortcomings. First, they rely on fairly indiscriminate measures of legislative change that merely count the number of amended articles. Second, they only compare adopted bill versions, thus disregarding all unsuccessful amendments, resulting in a lopsided view on intra-coalition bargaining. This study adopts a more fine-grained perspective on legislative review. We design a rule-based text analysis system that understands legislative text in order to generate all bill versions that had resulted from each amendment proposal, allowing us to study several open questions using a quantitative case study of a German state-level assembly. One, we show how coalition partners aim to change legislation. Do they add clarifications, discard, or alter parts that stray from the coalition compromise? Two, we examine how successful different amendment types are in shaping legislation. Three, we investigate which factors determine the use and success of amendments, such as the policy area and the origin of a bill.	Dominic Nyhuis	NA
2019	86143	799	Talk Dirty to Me: Coalition Signals throughout the Electoral Cycle	As coalition governments are the norm in proportional systems, parties announce their mating preferences during the electoral campaign, i.e., they send coalition signals in order to present voters with a viable choice. When and how parties signal their preferred coalitions is of particular interest to our understanding of dynamics in multi-party politics. We expect there to be different patters throughout the electoral cycle. First, parties will send more signals during the campaign compared to during the term in order to increase their chances of being voted into office. Second, during the term, parties will mostly send negative signals towards each other in an attempt to highlight their own competence. Third, coalition parties will diverge from this pattern and not send negative signals towards each other, since doing so would only harm the government unity. I test these expectations using quantitative text analysis of more than 20,000 press releases published by the German parties between 2000 and 2010. The findings reveal parties' strategies of communicating their coalition preferences throughout the whole electoral cycle in proportional systems.	Anna Adendorf	NA
2019	86191	836	Competing Logics of Roll Call Request in the European Parliament	Roll call votes are widely used to measure legislators’ ideology and to test theories of legislative politics. For example, there is a large literature that rely on roll call votes in the European Parliament to describe politics in the EP and to test theories of legislative politics more generally. However, in many parliaments, the EP included, roll call voting is not the default voting mode. It must be requested by an interested actor in order for the vote to be recording. Recently, the potential selection effects of roll call request have received scholarly attention. Two alternative theoretical logics are proposed; disciplining and signalling. We spell out the common and competing predictions that follow from these theories and test them empirically. A distinguishing feature of our empirical investigation is that we have, in addition to high quality data from the EP plenary, also have detailed data on voting in EP committees, and is hence able to establish the level of party unity and between party competition prior to the plenary stage.

2019	85772	569	Party competition, election manifestos and roll call votes in the formation process of a parliamentary democracy: Evidence from Weimar Germany	Patterns of legislative voting behaviour are structured by the different interests of the government and opposition camps in parliamentary democracies: members of parliament supporting the government mostly vote in favour of bills initiated by the cabinet, whereas MPs from the opposition normally vote against government bills. This pattern is developed less strongly in young democracies where MPs had not yet the chance to ‘learn’ how the interplay between the government and parliamentary party groups supporting the government works. We argue that the positions parties and their representatives adopt in their election manifestos and in their voting behaviour in parliament drift apart over time. We test our argument by comparing the positions of parties – estimated by a content analysis of election manifestos and by the analysis of recorded votes – in Weimar Germany in the time period between 1924 and 1932.

2019	86245	874	The sanction that isn’t imposed? Roll-call voting loyalty and demotion in European Parliament elections	Through their role in candidate selection and in the distribution of offices in the European Parliament (EP), national parties can be considered the gatekeepers and the main principal of MEPs. However, a puzzle of the growing literature connecting legislative behavior and EP elections is that voting loyalty towards the national party delegation does not affect MEPs' re-selection and re-election (van Thomme 2015, Frech 2016; Wilson et al 2016). The current study retests more thoroughly this (non)finding by analyzing the extent to which MEPs dissenting from the national party are demoted: either not re-selected at all, or nominated on worse list positions than previously. We control for two alternative explanations regarding how national parties evaluate their incumbents' EP behavior when drawing their electoral lists. Thus, national parties might reward MEPs for effort (measured through attendance of committee meetings) or for their performance (defined as ability to secure offices such as rapporteur, committee chair, EPG leader). Unlike past scholarship which focused on one election only, we assess the phenomenon across 3 different terms, relying on an original longitudinal dataset.	Mihail Chiru	NA
2019	82942	194	The political economy of Hybrid regimes of capital controls	Since the dismantlement of the Bretton Woods order, capital mobility has increased through the mutual reinforcement between growing cross-border financial flows and capital controls removal. However, despite the liberalizing measures in the 1980s and 1990s, several countries adopted only partial liberalization of their capital accounts. Similarly, transitory controls, designed in periods of financial instability, became permanent. Although the empirical literature has addressed the impact of different determinants on the level of controls, little is known about how these determinants interact and forge Hybrid regimes of capital account regulation. Relying on data for 84 countries between 1995 and 2015, this article uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore on what grounds these regimes have been built. Results reveal that emerging and developing countries have built Hybrid regimes to respond the domestic demand for protection from economic interests (industrial sector) and vulnerable social groups (politically represented by left-wing political parties) in face of recurrent currency crises. In the absence of these crises or domestic pressure for regulation, democratic countries have favored Open regimes, while left-wing authoritarian governments have built Closed ones.	Pedro Silva	NA
2019	86643	1186	Eager Hearts and Indoctrinated Minds	We study investment in human capital by governments and insurgents. Insurgents have the advantage of indoctrinating part of the population, ensuring support but at the cost of reduced education. Our framework highlights a novel effect of strategic indoctrination, which strengthens insurgent capacity. Specifically, we find indoctrination increases the amount of anti-regime activity, but not necessarily the insurgency's effectiveness. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which a government may underinvest in education to balance the risk between educating citizens -- making them more highly skilled for economic participation -- versus inadvertently strengthening future insurgent effectiveness. We develop a theory linking investment in education under the threat of insurgency to intentional under-provision of education, with implications for the effectiveness of insurgent and counterinsurgent activities. We then consider the effect of foreign investment in the education sector and its downstream effects on both domestic education expenditures and conflict outcomes. We examine the possibility that foreign aid may substitute for government provision of education in times of internal conflict, leaving the regime without the institutional capacity to develop human capital after the cessation of hostilities.

2019	86783	1213	Mapping Financial Networks in Europe: a Text-Reuse Approach	The literature on financial lobbying has detailed how influence is contingent on banks’ capacity to exert ‘network power’ by building alliances across the financial industry and wider business community. But less is known about the extent to which this varies between different national contexts. Varieties of Capitalism would predict significant divergence among European countries as a consequence of institutional modes of interest intermediation which structure state-business relations. To test these claims, we set out to map the configuration of financial interest networks and explain variation between key EU member states. Our analysis adopts a text-as-data approach to analyse a novel dataset of stakeholder responses to a range of post-crisis EU financial regulation. In particular, the paper uses a text-reuse detection algorithm to explore the extent and determinants of cooperation among financial institutions, as well as between financial institutions non-financial companies, in the design of financial policies at the EU level as well as how these ties vary significantly between different countries.

2019	86280	899	A Spatial Analysis of Senate Seat Selection	The paper seeks to analyse the nature of neighbourhood effects, as measured by spatial autocorrelation, on the Senate chamber floor. The research is twofold: 1) descriptively quantifying the level of spatial autocorrelation via NOMINATE scores, and 2) causally assessing the impact of neighbourhood effects on individual Senator's voting behaviour. We first develop various spatial weights matrices to outline the nature of spillover effects, using contiguity measures, Euclidean distance, and Zhang and Wang's (2016) asymmetric method (which incorporates both physical and ideological proximity). We then use Akaike's information criteria to justify the best choice of matrix. To account for both spatial and temporal dimensions of the data, which is pooled cross-sectional, we then create a spatio-temporal weights matrix inspired by Dubé and Legros (2012), incorporating the previous choice of spatial weight, and then use this in various one-, two-, and three-source models of spatial autocorrelation. Finally, to causally test for peer effects, we use the deaths of Senators as an identification strategy to investigate whether neighbourhood effects do influence voting behaviour of newly incumbent Senators. A basic difference-in-difference approach is employed.	Christopher Dann	NA
2019	85360	465	Ora et Guberna. The Economic Impact of Benedict’s Rule in medieval England	Early middle age Benedictine monasteries were characterized by the strict adherence to Benedict’s rule, establishing that the Abbot was an elective office (with majority rule), that his powers were constrained by the Rule itself and that he had an obligation to consult with the community on important decisions. At the same time, monasteries were feudal landlords, alongside with secular noblemen, governing over a wide range of manors. Were those (relatively) more inclusive institutions making a difference in the way manors were governed? To answer this question, we compare economic outcomes of secular and monastic manors in early medieval England. We analyse detailed data on more than 30.000 manors from the Domesday Book, combining fixed-effect, matching and spatial econometrics techniques. Preliminary results show that manors ruled by Benedictine monasteries experienced larger income growth, controlling for a wide set of potential confounding factors at the county and local district level. Finally, the result is robust when the analysis is restricted to the subsample of manors whose lord did not change throughout the observed period.	Federico Trombetta	NA
2019	85821	599	The Diffusion of Taxation, 1750-2015	The literature on fiscal capacity building makes the difficult assumption that tax introductions are mainly driven by domestic conditions. That is, they are independent policy choices by independent units. In this paper we challenge this assumption by asking whether tax introductions happen by policy diffusion. Do countries learn from each other when they seek to strengthen their fiscal capacity? We use a new dataset on tax introductions (Seelkopf et al. 2018, TiD in short) which covers six taxes (the inheritance tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax, VAT, social security contribution and consumption taxes) in 220 countries over the period 1750-2015. Using competing risk models from survival analysis and Bayesian Gaussian process regressions, we explore whether tax introductions can be explained as policy diffusion.	Zbigniew Truchlewski	NA
2019	85653	525	The origin of effective formal institutions: theory and evidence from medieval England.	Despite the recognition that institutions have a great impact on economic and political development, the same formal institutions can vary in effectiveness across different societies. When are formal institutions effective? And when are effective formal institutions put in place? I address these questions in a framework inspired by the institutional changes that took place in England in the 13th century. The framework emphasizes that formal institutions are effective only when they formalize existing custom. These institutions will tend to be chosen by strong kings, who will then have an incentive to keep them in place and slow down the process of institutional development. Consistent with path dependence, the progressive improvement of institutions requires precise timing.	Gabriel Leon	NA
2019	95372	1269	From religious violence to political compromise	This paper analyzes the long-term historical consequences of religious conflict that occurred during the period between the Augsburg Treaty (1555) and the Westphalian Peace (1648). We show that religiously divided communities that experienced the Catholic counter-reform faced relatively stronger demand for legal mechanisms of conflict resolution and developed distinct institutions of inter-religious mediation. We demonstrate that the creation of these institutions and the legalization of the religious conflict has a persistent effect to the present: citizens in localities that experienced counter-reform have a higher level of trust in political and legal institutions today. We also provide evidence that Protestant churches were an important vehicle for the transmission of institutional trust.	Isabela Mares	NA
2019	86442	1024	Risk Dynamics: Economic Trajectories and Political Reactions	Extant research in political economy shows that individuals react not only to their current economic situation but also to individual experiences (such as previous unemployment) and prospects (such as income expectations). In advanced capitalist labor markets, individual benchmarks and prospects are also subject to long-term experiences with latent labor market risks. Individual employment biographies are increasingly characterized by highly heterogeneous sequences of risk exposure. Over and beyond personal experiences in the labor market, latent threats to secure employment vary in intensity, timing, and volatility as a function of individual labor market transitions and macro-economic trends. Focusing on these risk dynamics, we analyze voters’ political reactions to different trajectories of employment security. Using high-quality household panels from three West European countries, we construct a time-sensitive measure of sectoral-occupational risk, analyze fluctuations in risk exposure over the course of individual employment biographies, and establish the magnitude and persistence of effects of changes in risk exposure on issue and party preferences. Our findings yield important implications for the wider debates on voting behavior, political contestation, and social mobility.	Denis Cohen	NA
2019	85300	443	Globalisation and support for social-democracy	In this paper we explain why socialdemocracy is no longer a relevant electoral actor in most industrialised democracies. We argue that globalisation and the spread of IT technologies has pushed these parties and their voters in opposite directions. Socialdemocracy adapted to globalisation by making policy concesions that eroded their credibility as redistribution champions. For voters, globalisation and IT technologies increased the level of socio-economic risk among voters from different social-class origins. The common expectation is that these voters demanded more redistribution and, hence, would support socialdemocratic platforms. We argue, however, that given the policy concesions made by these parties in the past, voters no longer trust traditional socialdemocratic parties and, consequently, no longer support them. We find empirical support for these claims using individual and aggregate data from the UK. Exploiting the BHPS panel survey, we show how preferences for redistribution exist while support for the Labour party declines. We confirm these results by using a novel dataset that combines electoral and census data at the district level for all general elections in the United Kingdom since 1981.	Rubén Ruiz-Rufino	NA
2019	83237	216	Misattributed Blame? Attitudes Towards Globalization in the Age of Automation	Many, especially low-skilled workers, blame globalization for their economic woes. Robots and machines, which rendered many routine jobs obsolete, are often viewed much more forgivingly. Elites and citizens celebrate technological advances as they mostly encounter technology in forms that enhance their lives. Immigrants and workers abroad, on the other hand, unfamiliar to most, make convenient targets for blame in an anti-globalization discourse that is laden with group cues. This paper argues that citizens tend to misattribute blame for economic dislocations toward immigrants and workers abroad, while discounting the effects of technology and automation. Using the 2016 American National Elections Studies (ANES) data, I show that individuals who are exposed to automation feel less secure about their jobs, and are more likely to support restrictions on trade and immigration.

2019	86347	949	Risks, Worries, and Preferences for Social Policy: Evidence from a Survey Experiment	Extant research of redistribution has provided two sources of risks that appear to generate individual preferences on redistribution: globalization and automation. In this paper we provide tests of both models of preference formation using a novel survey experiment of Korean respondents. While both models have limitation in measuring the sole effect of globalization/automation in risk formation, a randomized experiment allow us to separate and gauge the real individual perceptions. The existing arguments posit a link between economic concern derived from upcoming market changes and redistribution preferences. We find instead that there is little effect of labour market threats in shaping risks. We argue that past experience of job loss, rather than future expectations about job insecurity, matter in preference formation. Also this study finds that experience of discontinuous labor market participation lessens the income-based orientation in government spending.	Hyeok Yong Kwon	NA
2019	86325	932	Preferences for Technological Adjustment Policies	What explains individual support for policies to address technological change in the workplace? There remain few studies of preferences over such policies, in contrast to many studies on citizen views regarding other disruptions to the workplace such as trade, immigration, and outsourcing. We hypothesize that individual support for such policies depends on both information about winners and losers of specific policies and actual vulnerability to technological change. We tested these hypotheses with a large survey in an industrialized state where such concerns are salient (Spain). We measure preferences over a wide array of technology and information and communications technology (ICT) policies, such as increasing training, taxes on large tech companies, and support for individuals who lose jobs due to technological change versus other considerations. We randomize information provision of who wins and loses from such policies. We find that technological vulnerability conditions support for such policies and that individuals are no more supportive of compensating losers from technological change than other types of disruptions. The results are relevant for understanding how political coalitions can be constructed to address technological disruption.	Aina Gallego, Alexander Kuo	NA
2019	82225	155	The Financial Lives of Families. How Credit Regimes and Welfare States Shape Household Indebtedness	Debt has become an essential part of many families' daily lives. Yet we know little about the links between household indebtedness, credit markets, and the welfare state. In this paper, I propose a theoretical framework that suggests that credit markets fill the gap between families' financial needs and welfare states' financial support. Individuals increasingly go into debt to 'move onward' and address social risks as well as to 'move upward' and seize social opportunities. As these responsibilities shift from the public sphere onto individuals, credit markets emerge as private alternatives to social policies in cases where permissive credit regimes enable individuals to more easily borrow money. I substantiate this theory with macro level and micro-level panel data and demonstrate considerable cross-national variation in coping mechanism in response to unemployment. I then compare Danish and American households using event studies and difference-in-differences designs to document that how different degrees of risk protection in both countries leads to differential rates of borrowing. These findings have socio-economic and political consequences for wealth inequality, support for the welfare state, and social solidarity.	Andreas Wiedemann	NA
2019	85887	643	The politics of sovereign debt management: A two-level agent-based model	How do the political and economic costs of fiscal policy options shape sovereign debt management? The political economy literature suggests that decisions about sovereign debt management are affected by the anticipated asymmetric consequences of particular fiscal policies on different segments of society. However, work in cognitive psychology shows that individuals significantly depart from expected utility considerations, when acting on probability assessments. Against this background, I adopt a bounded rationality approach and develop an agent-based model that explores which factors determine the policy preferences of distressed countries' incumbents. In particular, I implement a two-level game where debt-related fiscal policies result from repeated interactions between the incumbents of a debtor country and the representatives of official as well as private lenders, as determined by continuous negotiations within the two groups. By accounting for the political, economic, and institutional factors that influence countries' debt sustainability, I show how heterogeneous and interconnected actors adapt to an evolving environment, with a view toward discriminating among competing mechanisms and predicting patterns of behavior in sovereign debt governance.

2019	86493	1065	Constraining creditors: How governments generate demand for their own debt	The literature has highlighted the political constraints posed by financialization: mobile financial assets should be harder to tax, as asset owners may easily reallocate their assets to low-tax investments or jurisdictions. Governments nevertheless require revenue to respond to their constituents and to remain in power. When the costs to raising revenue increase, governments must find ways to generate demand for their own debt. We present data documenting a new set of policies, borrowing privileges, which include mandates that institutional investors and collective investment funds hold their assets in government bonds. Borrowing privileges are unpopular with financial actors, as they may force investors to hold assets with lower returns and prevent portfolio diversification. We show that governments implement borrowing privileges to shore up demand for their debt when their borrowing costs are high. These policies are less common when financial actors are more influential, for example when the banking sector is concentrated. Most generally, the analysis shows that the government retains the ability to regulate even mobile assets, at the nexus between the financial service provider and its predominantly immobile customers.

2019	85147	408	Financial Crisis, Creditor-Debtor Conflict, Political Extremism	This paper studies the impact of debtor distress during a financial crisis on support for the populist far right. We use foreign currency borrowing of households in Hungary, combined with a large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation, as a natural experiment to generate a shock to household debt burdens. Exploiting zip code level variation in the prevalence of foreign currency household loans, we show that a 10 percent unexpected rise in debt-to-income increases the vote share of the far-right party Jobbik by 3.2 percentage points. Foreign currency debt exposure accounts for 20 percent of the overall rise in the far-right vote share. This result is robust to a variety of alternative explanations for increased far-right support and is corroborated by survey data on debtors and far-right supporters. We present evidence that conflict between creditors and debtors over the resolution of the crisis is an important mechanism in the electoral success of the far right.	Gyozo Gyongyosi	NA
2019	83748	237	Electoral Cycles in Bank Lending Explained	Do politicians direct bank credit for their political benefit? We know that public-sector banks often increase lending in election years and that politicians benefit electorally from bank connections. The mechanisms and the conditions that facilitate politically motivated bank lending are, however, not yet explored. We study the case of German savings banks and use original bank-level data, including information on bank loans and politicians’ de facto representation in banks’ governing bodies for 294 savings banks in eight German states between 2006–2016 to estimate a difference-in-difference model. We find evidence that “de facto” political representation in bank governing bodies, not “de jure” public ownership, drive electoral lending cycles: politically motivated lending policies are particularly likely in banks in which politicians act as chairperson, when many board members are active politicians, and when politicians in the bank’s board belong to a single party. The effect is driven by savings banks with county-level chairpersons from the conservative party and robust to various specifications.	Jonas Markgraf	NA
2019	86164	814	Talking the talk: Exploring conflict in European Central Bank Governing Council speeches using speaker-topic networks.	The Governing Council of the European Central Bank sets ECB policy, and communicates policy decisions to other EU institutions, the markets, and the general public. Despite its central role at the heart of European economic governance, we know relatively little about the degree to which its policy decisions are contested. In this paper we shed new light on conflict in the ECB Governing Council by studying the speeches made by Governing Council members. We first unveil the latent topical content of the speeches using a dynamic topic-modelling approach, and then construct a bipartite speaker-topic network to capture evolving issue coalitions over time. Our results demonstrate that the policy focus of the ECB Governing Council and the issue coalitions driving this focus have evolved significantly over time. This variation can be explained by both individual-level speaker characteristics, and the political, economic, and institutional context in which decision-makers interact.	James Cross	NA
2019	86519	1088	Political Independence and Agency Reform	Regulatory agencies derive their legitimacy from their political independence: For example, independent central banks and stock market regulators are insulated from political pressure, as politicians cannot be trusted to value long-term economic goals over short-term electoral goals. Nevertheless, policymakers should exercise oversight and reform these agencies when agencies fail to meet their objectives. This paper presents a principal-agent model to explore these competing incentives. The model shows that even unbiased policymakers refrain from reforming an inefficient agency if citizens cannot directly observe the bias of the policymaker and the outcome of the reform. Unbiased policymakers fear that they will be punished for their reforms, removed from office, and likely replaced by a more biased politician. For this reason, regulatory institutions, even when relatively ineffective, are likely to endure, as citizens do not trust politicians to reform them.	Amy Pond	NA
2019	86609	1165	Motivated Reasoning and Political Accountability	Standard political agency models assume voters form the most accurate beliefs possible about how politicians are performing. However, substantial evidence from political behavior indicates that voters have 'directional motives' beyond accuracy. These results are often taken as evidence that voters will not be able to hold politicians accountable for their actions. We probe this conclusion by formalizing a model of accountability where voters have both directional and accuracy motives in their beliefs. As long as moderate voters lack strong directional motives, not fully caring about accuracy does not seriously undermine accountability. The picture is less rosy if voters in the middle don't have weak directional motives, but have a ``motivation for moderation'', which makes them less responsive to politician behavior. We then consider extensions about how the media environment interacts with directional motives.	Andrew Little	NA
2019	86532	1101	Communication and the Fairness of Majority Voting	We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to investigate how communication affects the fairness of majority decisions. With communication, a minority might to try to persuade the majority to take their interests into account, making fairness considerations more salient. Alternatively, communication may facilitate coordination, thereby enhancing the formation of majority coalitions and increasing inequality. Our participants must choose between a fair allocation and one or more unfair allocations, and in our design we elicit social preferences and manipulate the difficulty majorities face in coordinating on unfair allocations. This allows us to distinguish communication used for coordination from communication used to persuade others to consider fairness. Communication increases fairness in the absence of coordination problems, but promotes majority tyranny when coordination is difficult. We find that discussion affects behavior even though subjects' messages are mostly brief and instrumental, devoid of substantive meaning, and rarely mention fairness. Our results also suggest a behavioral consequence of introducing a coordination problem: voters overreact and choose fair outcomes more often than their underlying social preferences would predict.

2019	86515	1084	On information processing and preference aggregation	We revisit the classical jury decision making problem by reinterpreting the information jury members process before taking their decision. A decision has to be made about a project. Each jury member receives the same signal but may interpret it differently, because of their own idiosyncratic preferences. We analyse the conditions that lead to information aggregation and decisions that maximise social welfare. Our results are applicable to a large variety of group decision making problems.

2019	86263	887	Pride and Shame in Voting: A Social Image Theory of Opinion Forming and Voting	We take social image concerns as point of departure for developing an integrated theory of information acquisition, opinion forming and voter turnout. We deviate from the literature that assumes that citizens collect information and vote with an eye on influencing the election outcome. Instead, we assume that political participation - acquiring information, participating in discussions, voting - is a social activity, driven by social concerns. Each citizen takes four actions. First, he can acquire information about the issues at stake in an upcoming election. This information may increase the probability that a citizen has a correct private opinion about these issues. Second, he decides what information to convey to the persons in his social environment. We model this by allowing citizens to send cheap-talk messages about their private opinions to each other. Third, on the basis of the discussions in his group, each citizen forms an opinion about the issues at stake. Formally, opinion forming is not an action, but just an updating of beliefs. Finally, each citizen decides whether or not to vote. The model generates a variety of predictions.	Otto Swank	NA
2019	86443	1025	Like-Minded Voters: An Endogenous Foundation for Electoral Factions and Groups	Ethical (or group-based) voting models generate behavior that is potentially more precise and realistic than standard pivotal voting models, but raise the question of how the electorally relevant groups form in the first place. We develop a voting model that endogenously generates electoral groups consistent with group-based voting by focusing upon like-minded voters. Like-minded voters are those voters who in equilibrium can agree on a best response given the behavior of all voters not within their faction. Restricting equilibria to those in which no like-minded faction has an incentive to deviate eliminates sincere voting and reduces the types of multi-position equilibria that may exist. If we consider turnout, there exist exclusively Duvergerian equilibria (those in which all voters vote for a very small number of positions), but with potentially bad welfare properties. For example, all positions that receive votes may be unanimously inferior to all positions that could have been chosen instead.	Benjamin Ogden	NA
2019	84792	362	Between Business and Nativism: How mainstream right party strategies affect their electorate in post-industrial societies	In this article, we investigate how the policy strategies of mainstream right parties affect their electoral fortunes. While a large body of research has examined the fate of social democratic parties in post-industrial societies, far less attention has been dedicated to the electoral fortunes of conservative parties. Here, we argue that mainstream right parties face trade-offs that are similar to those of the mainstream left. Taking hardline stances on immigration may allow them to appeal to socially-conservative working class voters. However, such a move will only be successful when coupled with more consumption policies. Yet, this strategy risks alienating the business oriented core electorate of the mainstream right. This is especially true in times of economic downturns and fiscal stress. We empirically investigate these questions at the party level and analyze how and under what conditions these strategies affect mainstream right vote shares. In a second step, using data from the ESS we investigate at the micro-level how different electoral groups respond to these strategies. Our findings underline the strategic trade-offs that mainstream right parties face in post-industrial societies.	Tarik Abou-Chadi	NA
2019	82854	185	The Fiscal Politics of Immigration: Evidence of Mechanisms from Survey Experiments in Japan	Who dislikes immigrants, and why? With novel data from a survey experiment undertaken in Japan, this paper finds that many citizens, in particular the poor and elderly, worry that immigrants will place a strain on the country's welfare system. The 'fiscal crowding' concern appears to dominate other reasons to fear or welcome newcomers, at least in countries such as Japan and the U.S. with a relatively small welfare state. Based on our findings, we discuss its implications and suggest that fiscal concern could also become more pronounced in countries with growing populations of aging citizens.	Seiki Tanaka	NA
2019	86270	893	Winning Hearts and Minds: The Role of Cultural, Economic and Security Considerations on the Successful Integration of Syrian Refugees in Turkey	How do economic, cultural and security concerns affect host society’s attitudes towards the economic, social and political integration of Syrian refugees in Turkey? Is (ethnic or religious) identity proximity between locals and refugee a more important determinant of successful integration than effort and desire (from the part of refugees) to integrate? These questions bare significant policy relevance as Turkey --a Muslim-majority country hosting more than 3.5 million refugees-- is considered by the EU as the ideal place to host most of the Syrian refugees. We conduct an online conjoint survey experiment (with a sample of 2,400 respondents) in which we present respondents with pairs of Syrian refugee profiles. We then ask our respondents which of the two profiles of refugees they would prefer to move next to their house (social integration), to give a work or business permit (economic integration) and to be given citizenship (ethnic integration). Our findings help to shed light to the channels that condition natives’ attitudes and animus towards refugees and thus inform public policies that aim at facilitating their integration in their host communities.

2019	129534	1279	Can Local Governments Increase Naturalization Rates? Evidence from a Large-Scale Informational Campaign	Recent research has shown that acquisition of host-country citizenship improves the economic, political, and social integration of immigrants. Despite these benefits for immigrants and host communities, naturalization application rates are frequently low. A common explanation for this is that many immigrants are unaware of eligibility requirements. We evaluate the impact of an intervention that addressed this hurdle. In 2017, the City of Zurich sent letters to over 30,000 immigrants informing them that they met residency requirements for Swiss citizenship. Using individual-level administrative data, we show that the informational letters doubled the application rate. To uncover the substantial heterogeneity in the effect of the letter, we leverage recent techniques in machine learning to identify the characteristics of immigrants who reacted most strongly to the letter. We find that immigrants who most recently passed the residency threshold for citizenship eligibility experience the largest effects, supporting the argument that the letters’ effect were due to the information they provided. This policy provides a useful blue-print for local governments around the world to facilitate naturalization and integration.	Dominik Hangartner	NA
2019	82282	160	Buying Words: How Campaign Donations Influence the Congressional Economic Agenda	An enduring puzzle in studies of economic and political power is what donors get from billions of dollars in campaign contributions each election. This paper advances a theory of money in politics in which contributions shape the content of the congressional agenda. We analyze the relationships between campaign donations and legislators' attention to eight economic issues in the nearly 500-million words spoken in Congress from 1995 to 2016. We find consistent evidence that organizations exert influence over the economic issues attended to by U.S. legislators. Contributions from labor unions increase legislators' attention to issues prioritized by the middle and lower classes and decrease attention to upper-class issues. Contributions from firms, industry, and professional associations increase attention to upper-class priorities and decrease attention to lower- and middle-class concerns. We find limited evidence that donors strategically increase contributions to already-favorable legislators and no evidence that donors effectively reward/punish legislators for past behavior.	Nathan Kelly	NA
2019	91444	1265	Kickbacks and Limits on Campaign Donations	How do campaign contribution limits alter the influence of donors over elected officials? We propose a model to explore this question and test its implications using data from Colombian municipalities. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits institutional rules determining contribution limits based on population thresholds, we find that looser campaign limits reduce the number of donors per candidate and increase the average donations received by the winner of the election. Moreover, we document that donors who contributed to the winner of the election are more likely to receive contracts from the supported candidate upon taking office. These patterns suggest that looser campaign limits increase the influence of fewer individuals in campaigns. A higher influence of donors over elected officials is reflected by the fact that looser limits are associated with more kickbacks for each donor, which are awarded in a more discretionary way.

2019	85953	676	Kompromat	Political actors often find it difficult to establish trust with one another. This hinders their ability to collaborate, potentially lowering the quality of policymaking and reducing social welfare more generally. We study a particular institution that is common in political settings: kompromat. Using a formal model, we demonstrate how the provision of kompromat can potentially improve policymaking. Counterintuitively, we show that kompromat works because it benefits the actor who is the subject of damaging information. We extend the analysis to show how kompromat reduces inefficiencies in a variety of contexts where political actors collaborate with one another, demonstrating the broad applicability of our findings.

2019	85744	556	Are Goodwill Ambassadors Good for Business? The Impact of Celebrities on IO Fundraising	Many international organizations that rely on voluntary funding collaborate with celebrity Goodwill Ambassadors to bring greater attention to their causes. This is an attractive advertising strategy for IOs: first, the increased attention can pressure governments to maintain funding to agencies. Second, celebrity endorsement may increase public donations, which come with fewer strings than government donations. Although individually small, public donations comprise a significant portion of agencies’ total revenues. Despite the significance of public donations to IO funding and, subsequently, their independence, there is limited research into the public appeal strategies of IOs and their effectiveness. We start to fill this gap by investigating the impact of celebrity endorsement on IO fundraising. Through a survey experiment, we address, first, whether a celebrity Ambassador appeal increases individuals’ likelihood to donate compared to expert appeals and, second, whether the effectiveness of a celebrity appeal is constrained by the political salience of the issue being propagated. Combined, these analyses advance our understanding of the fundraising mechanisms of IOs and also shed light on strategies available to IOs to enhance their independence vis-a-vis member states.

2019	85257	431	No Need for Democracy: inter-elite conflict and independence in the Andes	This papers asks why changes in political institutions do not necessarily lead to changes on economic institutions. In particular, this paper addresses why the rupture with colonial power did not bring more inclusive economic institutions to new republics. To address this question, this paper focuses on the independence from colonial power of the Andean countries, using a game-theoretic approach. This paper shows how, in a society composed by two elites and a non-elite, the conflict between elites leads to: 1) confrontation, and 2) limited voting rights and persistence of extractive economic institutions. Two elements prevent the accommodation between the elites: their similar strength, and the incapacity of the political elite to coalesce with the non-elite. The ability of the economic elite to attract the non-elite to the independence militia provided a credible mechanism to redistribute wealth and political power; with this mechanism, an extension of the franchise - democracy - was not needed. These results contribute to the literature on the persistence of economic institutions, the conditions for the extension of voting rights, and on the independence of the Andean region.	Raul Aldaz	NA
2019	86356	956	Overvaluing Deterrence in Counterterrorism	Many governments have made the deterrence of terrorist activities one of their top priorities. While preventing the occurrence of terrorist attacks is an important objective, defeating terrorist groups once for all should remain the ultimate goal of governments involved in the fight against terror. Using a game-theoretic model of the interaction between a government and a terrorist group, I assess the strategic consequences that deterring terrorism has on the long-term success against violent groups. Successful deterrence would imply a complete lack of action on the side of the terrorists. While this would guarantee perfect security in the short-run, it would prevent security agencies from capturing operatives and accessing useful information to accelerate the demise of the terrorist organization. Such a 'shut-out' strategy could be successful only if the terrorist organization is weak enough, in that it relies on terrorist acts to attract support and financing, while it would be suboptimal when facing a more resilient group. After identifying this trade-off, I assess how various political institutions interact with it and how this interaction affects the dynamics of terrorism prevention.	Livio Di Lonardo	NA
2019	81410	127	Information Disclosure in Elections with Sequential Costly Participation	Should we disclose less or more information on the actions of early voters to voters acting late during election days? Using a pivotal costly voting model of elections where sequentially acting voters have privately observed preferences over two candidates, I study how different information regimes (no disclosure, turnout disclosure, votes disclosure) affect voters' decisions to cast votes and what impact they have on voters' and candidates’ welfare depending on candidates' ex-ante support. First, I find that votes disclosure dominates the other regimes in terms of voters' welfare. Second, the ex-ante majority candidate has the highest chance to win under votes disclosure, the minority candidate with relatively substantial support benefits the most from turnout disclosure, while the minority candidate with low support is more likely to win under no disclosure. The last result implies that a particular choice of information regime by an agenda setting candidate may signal his support expectations.	Dmitriy Vorobyev	NA
2019	85359	464	Ballots instead of rocks? The impact of the Voting Rights Act on political violence	Does enfranchisement temper political violence ? This paper investigates the question theoretically and empirically in the context of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1960s US. I introduce a model featuring two groups competing over the control of public policies in two substitute contests: voting and rioting. Disenfranchisement occurs if the cost of voting is unequal among the two groups. This crowds out the discriminated group from the voting contest whereas the non-discriminated group wins the voting contest with a minimal investment (discouragement effect). Enfranchisement levels the playing fields. Both groups consequently increase voting while decreasing rioting. The VRA has forbidden discrimination in voting. Its coverage formula generated both geographic and temporal discontinuities in its application. The empirical strategy takes advantage of these features by comparing the evolution of political violence in geographically close covered and non-covered counties. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that VRA coverage reduced the incidence and the onset of political violence. I interpret these results as evidence that enfranchisement decreases political violence. Robustness checks lend credence to a causal interpretation of these results. Extensions validate the theoretical setting.	Jean Lacroix	NA
2019	86024	706	Democratizing from Within: British Elites and the Expansion of the Franchise	Why did the political class in Britain willingly extend the franchise to the masses in the nineteenth century rather than seeking to preserve the status quo? We revisit this question by studying how elite preferences over the franchise changed over this period. We apply ideal point estimation techniques to roll call votes on franchise reform in the House of Commons between 1826 and 1918 to estimate the preferences of MPs on this issue. Our preliminary results imply three main conclusions. First, the process of democratization in Britain was partisan rather than consensual: although the median MP generally came to support a more generous franchise with time, conservative MPs were almost united throughout in opposing almost any suffrage extension. Second, the pace of electoral reform was governed by two factors: the gradual leftward drift of Liberal MPs, which only accelerated from the mid-19th century onwards, and the conservatism of early Liberal leaders. Our initial analyses suggest that the process of social and economic modernization in Britain may explain much of the variation in legislator preferences we observe.	Chitralekha Basu	NA
2019	85915	659	Extension of the franchise and government expenditure on public goods: evidence from nineteenth century England	This paper develops a model predicting that the extent of the franchise has an inverted-U-relationship with government expenditure on public goods. Extending the right to vote from the rich to the middle class leads to increased spending, but further extensions lead to declines in expenditure. This prediction is tested by constructing a dataset of town council expenditure in Britain between 1867 and 1910. The effect of franchise extension is identified by exploiting regional and temporal variation in the right to vote. The results show strong support for the theoretical prediction, with government spending highest when around 50% of the adult male population was enfranchised.	Jonathan Chapman	NA
2019	85527	502	Democracy As You Like It? - Disentangling the Effect of Preferences from Institutional Impact	Theory suggests that both preferences and institutions shape political outcomes. However, endogeneity makes it difficult to estimate their independent impact empirically. To do this, I exploit the unique institutional context at the time when Switzerland introduced local female suffrage. Female enfranchisement was introduced conditional on a majority of men voting in favour in a local referendum, some of which had very narrow outcomes. With difference-in-differences, I compare election outcomes and government spending at the municipality level between cantons where women received the right to vote at different points in time between 1959 and 1990. First, I find an overall conservative shift caused by female suffrage. Second, comparing the causal effect of the institution “women’s suffrage' in Yes- and No-voting municipalities, I find significant electoral and spending differences, which show that ex-ante preferences influence the size but not the sign of the enfranchisement's impact. Third, I find that both preference-types of municipalities show a significant change of male support for a national franchise extension upon being exposed to female suffrage locally. I provide evidence unpacking the causal mechanism of this finding.	Selina Hofstetter	NA
2019	86395	987	Right or Left: the Political Legacy of Female Suffrage	What is the effect of female enfranchisement on electoral politics and public policies? While the idea that women were to vote more for conservative parties when they got the right to vote rapidly emerged as conventional wisdom, others contradict this proconservative stance by showing that social expenditure grew after women won the political rights. I contribute to this literature by exploring the effect of women’s enfranchisement in the context of the Spanish Second Republic (1931-1939). This emerges as an ideal setting due to strong stereotypes held against women, the influence of religion, and existing levels of political polarization. Using newly-collected data and an Instrumental Variable approach based on higher mortality rates among men caused by war and illnesses, this paper analyzes the effect of female suffrage on vote choice and abstention. This project deepens our understanding of crucial historical events and its implications for the gender bias.	Toni Rodon	NA
2019	86438	1021	Leaders, Factions and Party Unity	We develop a formal model of the internal game between the leader and the fac- tions of a party, to study the eect of party leadership on electoral success. Factions are of interest or of principle. The probability of winning an election is increasing in the leader's charisma, but also in party unity and the factions' total contributions to party work and electoral eorts. To push factions to contribute, the leader oers both types of factions their favorite rewards in exchange for their contributions. We show that party unity and factions' total contributions are not necessarily in- creasing in the leader's charisma and ideological proximity to the factions. Further, we show that factions of interest constraint the party's electoral strategy less than factions of principle. In particular, factions of interest always contribute more than factions of principle, are less of an obstacle towards achieving party unity, and oer the party more freedom in its choice of the ideological location and charisma of the party leader.

2019	85181	413	The Effects of Communication on the Occurrence of the Tyranny of the Majority under Voting by Veto	The tyranny of the majority is one of the most frequently discussed problems of democracy in political theory. It arises when winning majorities are permanent, and there are no checks on the majority’s ability to dominate the minority. We investigate the effects of communication on the occurrence of majority domination. Theoretically, communication cuts both ways. On the one hand, forming and maintaining a coalition requires coordination between individuals, which is barely accomplishable without opportunities to communicate. On the other hand, communication strengthens pro-social orientations in groups and should thus prevent the exclusion of minorities. We argue that the pro-social effects of communication dominate when communication is public whereas exclusive majorities form under private communication. We test our claim in a series of laboratory experiments where five-member committees make distributional decisions using the voting mechanism ‘voting by veto’. Compared to a baseline treatment without communication, groups distribute benefits more equally when they have the opportunity to communicate in a public chat. When communication is private, however, we see the formation of majority coalitions that exclude a minority of group members.	Jan Sauermann	NA
2019	85302	444	Knowledge vs. Numbers - Electoral Competition with Differently Informed Voters	Using a theoretical model we explore the biases inherent in electoral competition favouring a better informed minority at the cost of a worse-informed majority. The model is rich in the sense that it captures a variety of aspects. It describes two well-known functions of elections, aggregating preferences and aggregating information. It encompasses two kinds of policies, distributive policies and common value policies. Moreover, it allows political parties to learn the consequences of policies in two ways, through obtaining signals about the states of the world, and through learning voters' preferences. Furthermore, it describes campaigning by allowing political parties to send cheap-talk messages about the information they possess to voters. Finally, our model allows for the possibility that voting through a referendum does not lead to a socially optimal outcome. Our model allows to explore the phenomenon of the left-behind voter and the rise of populism in the sense of a party arising that caters to what voters (potentially wrongly) believe is in their interest instead of investigating and addressing the actual needs of a certain voter group.

2019	85451	489	Optimal Checks and Balances under Policy Uncertainty	Political checks and balances are certainly among the most debated desiderata in the construction or for the evaluation of a democratic system. This paper suggests a conceptual framework that could be useful to inform this debate. We propose a model where the pros and cons of a strengthening of checks and balances are respectively the reduction of type-I errors and the increase of potential type-II errors in policy decision-making. Checks and balances are less desirable for intermediate levels of competence of the political class and more desirable when the bureaucracy is slower or less reliable in the implementation of political decisions, when the political system involves frequent turnover, and in policy areas where the welfare effects of a reform are harder to evaluate. We also show that political leaders may fail to adjust flexible constitutions to changes in the environment.	Massimo Morelli	NA
2019	82930	192	Exporting Protection: Geographical Indications in EU Trade Agreements	Starting with the 2009 Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea, the EU has achieved increased external protection for some of its Geographical Indications (GIs), such as Prosciutto di Parma. This is achieved by specifying a level of protection above WTO Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) for FTA-specific lists of GIs. Statistical analysis of newly coded data for 11 FTAs shows that GIs with higher sales values are more likely to be protected. In contrast, the data do not support the hypothesis of lobbying by large and GI-rich countries. At first sight, these findings suggests a cost-benefit approach at protecting GIs outside of the EU. Yet one could question the overall benefit, since only about €1 billion of EU GI foodstuffs is exported outside of the EU. Identity aspects and the need to obtain public support for free trade seem to trump pure economic concerns in this area.	Martijn Huysmans	NA
2019	86380	977	Backward-Engineering Trade Protection: EstimatingWorldwide Industry-Level Trade Barriers	Protectionist trade policies affect many aspects of economic activity including production patterns, investment and innovation decisions, or the socio-economic status of citizens and workers. Unfortunately, reliable information on trade barriers has so far been unavailable, in particular, for non-tariff-barriers to trade (NTBs). Although NTBs make up the bulk of applied trade protection, few mandatory international reporting standards exist for these measures. In this paper, I present a method to statistically infer countries’ industry-level NTBs. Instead of relying on official data sources that are susceptible to biased reporting, I use observed trade frictions and information on trade elasticities to identify the size of unobserved trade barriers. Because of this indirect estimation method, my data are not affected by the self-selection and coverage problems prevalent in existing data sources. My protection data cover 160 countries and more than 200 industries. Expressed in terms of ad-valorem tariff-equivalents, these data provide a comprehensive picture of the pattern of trade protection around the world. I show that my NTB data strongly outperform other trade protection data in predicting depressed trade flows.	Marco Martini	NA
2019	83934	251	Trade Policy in a “GVC World”: Multinational Corporations and Trade Liberalization	The globalization of production is changing the political economy of trade policy-making: Traditional supporters of free trade are joined by new actors (e.g., import-dependent groups) in their lobbying efforts for trade liberalization. Multinational corporations (MNCs), which are among the strongest supporters of free trade, play a crucial role in these new alliances due to their substantive resources and corporate connections with each other. Based on this argument, we expect variation in trade policy preferences across industries depending on their degree of integration in a global network of multinational corporations. Moreover, an industry’s position in the global value chain should matter for trade policy outcomes. We test these expectations using a disaggregated dataset on the level of tariffs and speed of tariff cuts in preferential trade agreements and firm-level data of international mergers and acquisitions. The paper sheds light on the processes and outcomes of trade policy-making in a globalized economy by further developing an existing argument on GVCs and trade policy outcomes as well as expanding on it by adding data on international corporate connections.

2019	84068	266	Worth fighting for? The selection of Foreign Trade Barriers for WTO litigation	In order to curb the incentive to install WTO-inconsistent trade measures, the WTO agreements provide member states with the possibility to challenge other members’ trade policies. Over the last decades, WTO disputes have revolved around all kinds of foreign trade barriers (FTBs). However, a quick look at the list of WTO disputes indicates that certain FTBs are more prone to litigation than others. This paper studies why certain FTBs are often selected for WTO litigation whereas others are only seldom challenged. We present a game-theoretic approach and argue that the pre-litigation game that plays out in anticipation of a WTO dispute has a strong impact on the selection of FTBs for WTO litigation. The government-industry interaction that takes place before a WTO complaint is filed, determines the number of complaints, and which party provides the financial support for preparing a complaint. The veto power of governments in filing a WTO complaint explains why certain trade barriers, such as export barriers, are more prone to litigation than import-lowering FTBs.	Sven Van Kerckhoven	NA
2019	86793	1215	Social preferences for margins of trade	Existing IPE work analyzes why do individuals prefer more or less openness, this is, the intensive margin of trade. While different trade models (i.e., factors, sectors, or heterogeneous firms) help to derive predictions for openness vs. autarky, they are also uninformative about demands for different forms of integration to the trade network. Here, I argue that social preferences for trade policy depend on different combinations of trade exposure and diversification (in both exports and imports). This is the first systematic analysis of social preferences on the intensive and extensive margins of trade. I conduct conjoint survey experiments in 15 Latin American countries. The evidence shows that preferences for a wide range of alternative trade profiles vary across skills, economic sectors, type of firms in which individuals are employed, and the so-called 'love for variety'. Second, some trade profile attributes significantly affect perceptions of risk and demands for protection and compensation. This research has important implications for the literature on trade policy, preferences, and compensation.	Santiago López-Cariboni	NA
2019	84256	279	Political Determinants of Economic Backwardness: An Empirical Investigation	Economic backwardness, i.e., slow rates of technological progress in certain states, constitutes one of the central topics in political economy of development. Yet, researchers have not reached a shared consensus regarding causes of technological stagnation. We argue that firms can use two strategies to gain edge in competition: innovating themselves or blocking innovations developed by competitors. At the firm level, state-owned firms tend to invest in blocking rather than innovate because marginal returns to blocking, especially via political connections, exceed those of investments in R&D. At the country level, democratic institutions incentivize firms’ investment in innovations because politicians in democracies are more limited in their abilities to block technologies. A firm’s decision to innovate is, therefore, largely mediated by political institutions: while democratic settings incentivize firms to invest in innovations, authoritarian settings incentivize firms to block innovations. We employ Bayesian multi-level model that allows us to test both firm-level and country-level hypotheses within a unified framework and thereby provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of political determinants of economic backwardness. The empirical results corroborate our hypotheses.	Dina Rosenberg	NA
2019	86622	1175	When State Building Backfires: Elite Divisions and Collective Action in Rebellion	We examine the complementary roles of state weakness, elite divisions, and peasant grievances on rebellion. We argue that state-building efforts increase division among local and national elites, which undermines local peacekeeping efforts and allows for uprisings to occur. As a result, for a given level of grievance, peasant revolts are more likely to be attempted and more likely to spread in areas where the elite is divided. We assess these ideas using subnational data on rebellion, tax centralization, and drought from the late 18th-century to the Mexican War of Independence. We show that droughts led to peasant uprisings during the late colonial period, and that their impact was magnified after a major elite split in 1808. During the war, insurgent mobilization was more likely in areas that experienced severe drought just before the onset of conflict, but also in areas of higher exposure to the Bourbon centralization of tax collection, which reduced the rents available to the local elite and thus elite loyalty to the government.

2019	86623	1176	Population Pressures: Migration, Repression, and Agrarian Reform in Latin America	Emigration is often portrayed as a “safety valve” that reduces population pressure and social unrest. I develop a model to illustrate that the ameliorating effect of outmigration on land conflict can have an ambiguous effect on redistribution. Outmigration can reduce pressure on elites to redistribute land, but it may also lower the political and economic costs of reform. This can open up opportunities for increased mobilization and change. Conversely, a shock to the availability of exit options can lead to increased social mobilization for change, but it can also encourage elite repression. I present empirical support for the model using subnational evidence on migration opportunities, agrarian mobilization, and agrarian change in Mexico, El Salvador, and the Philippines. I conclude by discussing implications for migration and redistributive politics more generally.	Emily Sellars	NA
2019	84523	327	Democracy and Developmental State in Latin America: between the industrializing rush and the distributive need	In the Twentieth century, several countries pursued developmentalist policies to achieve industrialization and economic development. This forged a political economy literature about the conditions that allowed developing countries to build Developmental States. However, most of the cases covered by this literature were characterized by non-democratic regimes. In face of this gap, this article discusses how the democratic regime affects the economic performance and the social consequences of Developmental States (DS), comparing the path of two Latin American countries: Chile Democratic DS under Radical Party, and Mexico Authoritarian DS under Institutional Revolutionary Party period. These cases are similar in several aspects, but different in their political regime during the period. Considering the opposite outcomes of these two countries, this article uses process-tracing to disentangle the mechanisms that tie democracy to slower industrialization and better income distribution. The findings show that the presence of left-wing parties in the parliament, the existence of competitive opposition and the organized and free labor unions contribute to slow down the industrialization, while favor the increase of wage share and the extension of social policies.

2019	84127	271	Labour market deregulation and anti-immigrant attitudes	What are the effects of labour market deregulation and increased immigration inflows on immigration attitudes and radical right voting? Despite increased levels of dualism and free movement of labour in European countries over the last two decades, the effects of these policy developments are still unclear in the literature. This study argues that high concentrations of migrant workers in non-standard forms of employment decrease economic redistribution towards, and labour competition with, immigrants. Consequently, the politicisation of immigrant-native conflicts is paradoxically lower when immigration and labour market dualism cluster together at the occupational level. These claims are validated cross nationally, and in a difference-in-differences setting analysing the impact of the 2005 German Immigration Act.	Sergi Pardos-Prado	NA
2019	84863	371	Affording Independence? Economic Crises and Support for Regionalism in Europe	European regions are seeing significant levels of support for autonomy and independence. My argument is that widening economic inequality between regions and states in the wake of economic crises is exacerbated by governments' inability to respond to the resulting differentiated preferences. This relation is not only reflected in changes in vote choice following economic downturns, but also in the language parties use to communicate their regionalist agenda. On the voter level, I assess electoral support in a European sample of regions represented by regionalist parties in regional elections between 1950 and 2010. On the party level, I investigate how economic downturns are reflected in parties’ framing of decentralization demands in Spain using data from the Regional Manifestos Project for regional elections surrounding the 2009 crisis. I establish that economic crises are associated with increases in regionalist vote share, and find that positive changes decentralization demands by regionalist parties in Spain are accompanied by references to economic conditions. The findings shed new light on how economic downturns affect party systems, vote choice, and the performance and agendas of regionalist parties.	Friederike Luise Kelle	NA
2019	86074	744	Losing support in times of crisis: Cross-pressured voters and government approval	Economic crises and austerity measures pose fundamental threats to the support and survival of governments. Previous findings have emphasized how voters punish incumbents in line with aggregate economic conditions during crisis. However, an economic crisis increases the pool of voters whose perceptions of the national economy diverge substantially from their subjective welfare. We conceptualize these voters as cross-pressured and argue they decouple their incumbent approval from the evaluation of the national economy. This is a vital mitigation mechanism that helps to understand the dynamics of government support during crisis. Our empirical analysis focuses on Latvia, which was hit hart by the economic crisis that started in 2008. We analyze monthly data on government support from 2006-2011. Relying on item response theory we create consistent egotropic and sociotropic indicators from a number of survey questions and measure how much people are cross-pressured during the crisis. We find that overall trends of approval followed aggregate economic conditions, however, cross-pressured voters decouple their approval from their perceptions of the economy. This points to a conditioning role of diverging perceptions on sociotropic government support.	Thomas Willi	NA
2019	86492	1064	The Impact of Structural Reforms on Electoral Outcomes: Using a New Database of Regulatory Stances and Major Policy Changes	We explore the linkage between enacting structural economic reforms and subsequent electoral outcomes. Structural reforms produce economic dislocations and adjustment costs in the early stages of reforms. We present a unique new database of regulation and reforms in these policy areas: (i) domestic finance; (ii) external finance; (iii) trade (tariffs and payments liberalizations); (iv) product markets; and (v) labor markets. The dataset includes data for 90 advanced and developing economies from 1973 to 2014. Examining nearly 500 elections in 65 countries, we find that reforms of the external, but not domestic, sector immediately prior to elections are costly to incumbents.	Dennis Quinn	NA
2019	86383	979	Misremembering Weimar: Experimental Evidence on the Roots of German Stability Culture	A familiar argument in the debate about economic policy during the Euro crisis is that Germany is characterized by a particular stability culture. Scholars assume that this stability culture derives from the collective memory of hyperinflation. We study this theoretical mechanism directly; i.e., the effect of the hyperinflation narrative on German voters’ monetary policy preferences. Moreover, the hyperinflation frame may be so powerful that voters conceptualize hyperinflation and the Great Depression as being the same event, conflating hyperinflation in 1923 and deflation in 1932. We thus argue that informing Germans that the Great Depression was a deflation crisis induces more support for expansionary monetary policy. After all, this would lead them to revise their implicit understanding of the economic crisis most proximate to the collapse of the Weimar Republic. We run a survey experiment among 2500 German voters and focus on two outcome measures: preferences for ECB policy and the inflation-unemployment trade-off. We run the same experiment among Dutch voters, where we expect no effect of the hyperinflation narrative, as the Netherlands did not have to face a hyperinflation crisis.	Nils Redeker	NA
2019	86323	931	Fairness and Redistribution via Taxation: A Conjoint Experiment	If given the opportunity, would citizens in highly unequal countries choose to soak the rich through redistributive taxes? While it is widely assumed that inequality would trigger a desire to soak the rich, recent evidence suggests that such redistributive preferences are not so straightforward in the world’s most unequal regions. In this paper, we explain this puzzle by drawing and testing a new conceptualization of redistributive preferences. In some political contexts - even where inequality is very high – individuals will not perceive a necessary trade-off where citizens must pay taxes in order for the poor to benefit from social spending. We test this expectation through the analysis of a conjoint experiment embedded into an original survey conducted in Mexico City and Bogota. We find that citizens of all income levels in both cities have strong preferences against taxing the poor, but only citizens in Bogota would choose to tax the rich. Their counterparts in Mexico City express little desire to tax any income bracket, despite their eagerness to help the poor.	Nestor Castaneda, David Doyle, Cassilde Schwartz	NA
2019	86372	969	Group identification and redistribution in democracies: an experiment	We test in the laboratory four mechanisms through which group identification might affect redistribution in representative democracies. From the voters’ side, group identification can give rise to a preference for own group payoffs, for electing an own group candidate, and could be used to assess more accurately a candidate’s character. From the candidates’ perspective, identity might affect the optimal campaign platforms. There is evidence to support all four channels. Consistent, with Klor and Shayo (2009), we find the own group payoff motivation works against redistribution when the majority group is richer than the minority one. The other mechanisms, however, combine to make redistribution depend on a hitherto unrecognized factor: the political representation of the minority group. Indeed, we find that the post-redistribution economic inequality is decreasing in the number of minority candidates. Importantly, this is not a mere consequence of minority candidates favoring redistribution; voters also vote more for redistribution when it is proposed by minority candidates compared with when proposed by a majority one.

2019	81481	130	Bank Credit and Preferences for Redistribution: Experimental Evidence from the UK	Do voters see credit supply as an acceptable substitute for welfare? The ‘demand side’ of credit expansions in advanced democracies has raised academic interest and come under increased scrutiny. And while previous scholarship has provided important insights from observational data showing that better access to financial markets is associated with lower levels of redistributive demands, those studies face two important caveats: (1) they cannot rule out concerns about endogeneity and (2) they rarely distinguish between the ‘insurance’ and ‘redistribution’ role of the welfare state. We add to this literature by using a survey-experimental design that warrants a cleaner identification strategy to verify the existence of a causal credit access effect on preferences for redistribution. We conduct a conjoint analysis in the United Kingdom that allows to trace who is willing to accept facilitated access to bank credit as a substitute for the welfare state; it moreover enables us analyze whether voters see bank credit is as a substitute for redistributive policies or for social insurance aspects of the welfare state.

2019	85536	503	Self-interest or system justification? An experimental assessment of the effect of income inequality on political attitudes	Standard behavioral models predict that income inequality would lead to an increase in concern with inequality and support for redistribution. Yet, evidence for this expectation is mixed. On one hand, some scholars show that low income individuals or those living in more unequal neighbourhoods or localities are more concerned with inequality than those who are not. On the other hand, there is evidence that income differences are generally perceived as being legitimate by the public. Drawing on system justification theory, which suggests that most individuals are motivated to believe to perceive the social system as fair, some showed that individuals habituate to rise in income inequality by adjusting their expectations of fairness, which leads them to be even more accepting of inequalities. These studies use different data, methods, and different dependent variables that prevent us from arriving at conclusions about the effects of income inequality on individual attitudes. Using online survey experiments from nationally representative samples from the United States and the United Kingdom and direct measures of concern with income inequality, I test both propositions simultaneously.

2019	86268	891	Social status, inequality perceptions and support for redistributive policies among politicians	Economic inequality constitutes a defining challenge of our time and it remains puzzling to scholars why rising levels of inequality have not lead to more redistributive policies. However, a neglected aspect of this puzzle is to focus on politicians and their understanding of inequality. By studying political elites and thus in essence those that take the decisions about redistribution or not, we get leverage at the question whether political elites also hold misperceptions about inequality and which variables are key in explaining their evaluation of inequality. In this paper, we study the effect of social status on redistributive preferences among politicians. Taking federalized Switzerland as a case, we focus on cantonal MPs as the cantons have far-reaching power over the allocation of welfare and are thus the ideal case to study. In a survey experiment, we manipulate politicians’ perceptions of the socioeconomic hierarchy and their place in it to study the effects of social position on a range of redistributive policy preferences.

2019	85659	528	Do Economic Crises Fuel Income Inequality?	This paper investigates the impact of economic crises on income inequality. Important evidence has emerged that in the aftermath of crises politics becomes polarized and economists have linked this to greater differences in income due to crises (Atif, Sufi and Trebbi 2013). The evidence however on whether crises can be linked to divergent incomes is weak and plagued by the possibility of a reverse effect going from great disparity in incomes to major economic crises. We use the available data on crises and types of crises (Laeven and Velencia 2013; Reinhart and Rogoff 2011), income inequality (Solt 2009) and capital shares (Houle 2009), as well as General Method of Moments models to more credibly tackle the complex theoretical and empirical relationship between crises and inequality. We find strong evidence that currency, banking, inflation and debt crises increase inequality.	Christian Houle	NA
2019	87291	1245	Political consumption as a tool for social justice. Differentiating between the political consumption of goods and services.	The rise of political consumption as a form of political participation has gained increasing attention within public opinion research. Via political consumption, citizens can indicate that they want certain market or political practices to be changed. In this paper, we argue that the current literature on political consumerism has overlooked an important way in which citizens can politically consume, i.e., via the political consumption of services. On the basis of an original Belgian sample, we demonstrate that citizens make a distinction between the consumption of goods for political, ethical or environmental reasons and the consumption of services. A distinction that holds when differentiating between the buycotting or boycotting of services or goods. Moreover, we find evidence that citizens differentiate between the use of traditional services and sharing economy services when buycotting or boycotting these. Overall, we show that a social justice frame is strongly prevalent for the consumption of traditional services, whereas ecological concerns are more important for the consumption of goods. Finally, citizens do not seem to take political considerations into account when consuming sharing economy services.	Silke Goubin	NA
2019	85947	672	The Dynamic of Policy Response to Public Opinion: Institutions, Taxation and Inequality	The idea of democracy assumes policy respond to some degree to public opinion – public opinion affects who is in government, and this affects policy. Responsiveness to public opinion is difficult to assess, however, as it is difficult to measure changes of public opinion over time. We use an item response theory algorithm (McGann 2014) to create a measure of policy mood that is comparable over time from the myriad of survey questions asked over the last 40 years. We test whether policy (measured by the level of government spending and the degree of redistribution) responds to public mood on government spending/taxation and on inequality. We test these relationships using over time in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. These countries allow us to explore policy responsiveness under different political institutions. The UK and USA have winner-take-all elections, while the Netherlands and Germany have proportional elections and coalition governments. The UK and the Netherlands have simple majority rule legislatures, while Germany and the USA have division of power and multiple veto gates.	Anthony McGann	NA
2019	86572	1136	Fiscal Redistribution and Economic Voting: Evidence from Errors in the German Census	We provide new evidence on the relationship between sub-national fiscal transfers and economic voting. Using a panel of 12,000 German municipalities over 8 years, we show that decreased local spending led to increased vote shares for right-wing parties in the national elections but did not affect vote shares of incumbent district candidates. To obtain causal estimates, we exploit errors in the 2011 German census. The census population estimates determine how federal taxes are redistributed to municipalities. For a number of municipalities below a pre-specified population threshold, the 2011 census underestimated population changes by more than 50%. This allows us to obtain quasi-random variation in per-capita transfers and spending. The results suggest that local government spending can have repercussion for voting at the national level, but that voters do not punish their local incumbents.	Hanno Hilbig	NA
2019	84223	276	Circles of Solidarity: Redistribution and the National Contexts of Diversity in Developed Democracies	The relationship between welfare policy and racial, ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity gained notable scholarly attention in the past few years. Despite mixed findings, research in political economy has cemented the notion that diverse democracies are less cohesive and thus maintain smaller welfare states. However, a separate literature on individual-level preferences finds that intergroup solidarity varies by its contextual environment, particularly intergroup inequality and geographic contact. Bridging this theoretical and empirical gap, I argue that diversity dampens redistributive outcomes only and insofar as it is reinforced by either intergroup inequality or regional segregation. These two mediating factors, however, have different redistributive implications. Diversity with higher intergroup inequality fractures solidarity along class lines, thus furthering regressive policies that underprioritize the poor. Diversity with higher regional segregation, meanwhile, fractures solidarity along geographical lines, thus advancing decentralized redistribution at the expense of a robust national system. I find empirical support in these hypotheses using cross-sectional time-series data from 22 democracies over 31 years. Hence, I show that the negative relationship between diversity and redistribution depends on complex cleavage structures with different redistributive implications.	Alon Yakter	NA
2019	84401	301	Insuring Altruism: Labor Market Risks and the Social Insurance Design	Social insurance models prominently argue that selfish demand for future benefits explains support for redistribution among the rich. In this article, I posit that social insurance defines the scope of other-regarding preferences. The welfare state provides benefits to insure against individual exposure to labor market risks. Some welfare states provide social safety nets and benefits are provided in equal amounts to everyone, while in others, benefits are related to previous earnings and stabilize individual incomes over the life-cycle. These structural differences define the relative impact of labor market risks on individual income, and consequently, the stability of one's living status over time. I employ simulated unemployment replacement rates to construct a measure for the governing principle of social insurance and show that average support for redistribution is higher in earnings-related systems. Labor market risk has a stronger impact on redistribution preferences in flat-rate systems. Experimental evidence shows that risky endowments influence transfer shares negatively. Previous social insurance approaches have not taken into account the other-regarding perspective.	Verena Fetscher	NA
2019	85682	536	Striking a biased balance: mobilization, autonomy and change in the design of labor provisions in preferential trade agreements	This paper presents an original explanation to change in the design of labor provisions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) over time. Its main questions are: how do labor provisions in PTAs change? How much change should we expect to see every time a new PTA is negotiated? Because the promotion of labor protection in PTAs is usually seen as a tug-of-war between opposed domestic interests, one could think of strong labor protection in trade deals as a sign of weakness of exporters and strength of import-competing interests. However, I argue that the strength of labor clauses can be causally linked to the strength of exporters’ mobilization. I theorize that the more successful exporters are in their push for ambitious trade deals the greater the counter-mobilization of fair trade groups. That will lead to stronger labor protection in PTAs depending on the autonomy of the negotiator and on its bargaining power. I test that argument on the EU-Chile, EU-Colombia, US-Chile and US-Colombia cases using the method of process-tracing. This paper contributes to the literature on trade-labor linkage, lobbying and delegation.	Rodrigo Cezar	NA
2019	85962	683	How Do Capital and Labor Split Economic Gains? Globalization, Organized Labor, and Wage-Bargaining Institutions	One of the enduring questions in political economy is how capital and labor divide economic gains. Recent debates about the 1% vs. 99% and income inequality suggest an increasingly unfavorable economic split for labor. Yet, how capital and labor split economic gains in an increasingly global economy, and whether organized labor and wage-bargaining institutions play a role, is less well understood. Using private-sector data from 17 industrial democracies over 30 years, we demonstrate several important patterns. First, while labor compensation and corporate profits both increase in absolute terms, the ratio of compensation to profits decreases sharply, indicating a decline of the gains for labor relative to capital over the last three decades. Second, the decline of the compensation-profit ratio is associated with a rise in economic openness and a decline in union density. Third, there is a clear cross-national convergence in these patterns across corporatist and non-corporatist countries. We argue that these stylized facts point to the movement of advanced industrial democracies of all types – corporatist or not – toward a new equilibrium of global capitalism.	Erica Owen	NA
2019	85965	684	Firms versus Workers? The Politics of Openness in the Era of Global Production and Automation	As the examples of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump remind us, openness to the international economy is a choice. Democratic governments in open economies must confront a long-standing dilemma. On the one hand, when citizens hurt by globalization demand protection, governments must respond. On the other hand, governments have to guard the benefits of globalization from protectionist rhetoric and policies. Yet the increasing ability of firms to split up the production across countries or automate has altered the nature of this dilemma. Fundamentally, in a world of fragmented production and automation, workers’ welfare is delinked from the firms and industries in which they are employed. As such, policies that benefit firms may not benefit workers in those firms. How do different governments address the potential trade-off between democratic accountability and economic efficiency in the new global economy? To answer this question, I (1) examine how global production shapes interests and influence of workers relative to firms, and the consequences for the politics of openness and (2) consider empirical strategies for evaluating the influence of workers versus firms.

2019	83434	226	Ethno-Religious Diversity, Authoritarian Rule, and Public Goods Provision: Evidence from Ottoman Istanbul	This paper uses water provision data from Ottoman Istanbul to examine how political geography and ethno-religious identity impact the provision of local public goods in authoritarian regimes. Exploiting the fact that water fountains, built and maintained by the political elite as private endowments, were the only means of providing drinking water to most in Ottoman Istanbul, I demonstrate that the ruling class is more likely to contribute to public goods when the system is designed to deliver exceptional benefits to the benefactors’ co-ethnic group. Using an original dataset from 1580-1800, on the spatial distribution of fountains in Istanbul and ethno-religiously segregated neighborhoods, I find a systematic relationship between the choice of fountain site and the benefactor’s own ethnic community. The finding provides a novel answer for why political elites are more willing to fund social services certain groups in authoritarian settings. This finding may be generalized to a broad range of similar cases.	Asli Cansunar	NA
2019	86221	857	The Conditional Economic Roots of Authoritarianism: The Role of Social Organizations	In this paper we investigate further the economic roots of nationalist and radical-right voting. Specifically, we illustrate a key moderating role played by social organizations such as trade unions and other left organizations. We exploit an integrated ESS file with individual-level data. We exploit the import shock measures at the regional level, but we match the imports’ exposure data with regional data on historical density of left organizations. We also employ historical regional data on mining areas to endogenize the density of social organizations. The results show that exposure to import shocks is actually not associated with more nationalist and radical-right voting in regions where (i) left-organizations has been historically present and (ii) austerity measure after the 2008 economic crisis has been less severe. Instead, greater exposure to import shocks is associated to radical-right voting where austerity measures were severe and when left-organizations have not been present. The results point to a nuanced picture in which the rise of nationalist and radical-right voting has economic roots, but such roots are actually moderated by the presence of social organizations.

2019	86456	1035	Political Outsiders and Democratic Backsliding	What explains the rise of political outsiders to high office? And what are the implications of such leaders for the continuation of democratic rule? In this paper, we argue that, under democratic rule, outsiders are most likely to rise to high office when political parties rely on electoral strategies emphasizing candidate charisma, rather than emphasizing coherent party brands. Parties adopt charisma focused strategies when short-term electoral considerations are prioritized over long-term success -- a situation most likely to arise in contexts characterized either by ideological polarization or electoral volatility. This reliance on the charismatic appeal of individual politicians renders political parties more dependent on their leaders, and so less able to check authoritarian backsliding, than when campaigns center on party-centric appeals. Outsiders are thus associated with backsliding and even autocratic reversion. In what follows, we formalize these intuitions. We then test (1) whether polarization and volatility are associated with outsider chief executives in democratic states; and (2) whether outsider leaders are associated with democratic backsliding, where political outsiders are defined as chief executives without prior experience in elected office.

Why did the capitalists play a significant role in some of the early democratization movements of mainly Western European countries, while they are conspicuously absent in almost all of the Third Wave countries' democratization movements? This paper argues that these two questions are closely related. As the industries in the country face increasingly more competition from potential foreign entrants (higher level of potential FDI), workers are more likely to support democratization due to the larger wage benefits from free flow of FDI under democracy, while capitalists are less likely to support democratization due to their increasing need for protection from the authoritarian regime in the form of FDI restriction. However, the effect of higher level of potential FDI on democratization prospects is ambiguous, as it does not only increase workers' incentive to revolt, but also increase the dictator's resistance to democratization due to the larger share of rents they can extract from capitalists in exchange for protection.

2019	86677	1197	Election Monitoring and Government Performance: Theory and Experiment	We study the effects of election monitoring on government performance in semi-democracies where governments may engage in corruption and also rig election results. We do so by varying the capacity of such monitoring technology: (1) there is no monitor; (2) there is a monitor who may simply detect fraud with some probability; (3) and there is a monitor who detects fraud with some probability but may also erroneously call an election fraudulent when in fact not. Our formal model and experimental analysis demonstrate that the different qualities of monitors affect an incumbent’s incentive to rig elections and, thus, her performance in office. We discuss various policy implications of our study to improve the effects of election monitoring on public welfare.	Kazuto Ohtsuki	NA
2019	82878	188	Rules of Aid:A survey experiment on the logic of aid allocation in post-conflict countries	International aid donors have increasingly focused their resources on fragile and conflict-affected countries to help them break out of the cycle of violence and underdevelopment. Scholarship on international aid, however, argues that donors are not motivated by the needs of the recipient country but by their own strategic interest. Relying on an original survey-embedded experiment administered to over 1,100 experts working for donor and implementing organizations, this paper argues that aid allocation behavior is not determined by strategic interest alone. Instead, it is based in heuristic, as opposed to holistic, foreign policy decision-making that leads donors to allocate aid in predictable ways in response to signals from the conflict-affected country that conflict dynamics are increasing or decreasing. The responses from the first global survey experiment of donor and implementer country-level staff, shows that these results hold regardless of the recipient country or donor organization	Gabriele Spilker	NA
2019	85961	682	Foreign determinants of the Shadow Economy: The effect of Loans and Foreign Aid.	Does foreign aid strengthen or weaken economic development in recipient countries? Specifically, how does it shape the incentives of individuals to operate in the formal versus informal economy? We examine the effect of foreign aid on the size of the 'shadow economy' in developing countries. We hypothesize that aid provided in the form of bilateral loans reduces the size of the shadow economy, while aid in the form of grants increases it. We base our argument on the distinction that loans must be repaid while grants do not. As a result, grants lower the government's dependence on tax revenue. In addition, receiving resources without the expectation of repayment is likely to allow for higher levels of improper consumption and discretionary spending. In contrast, when an expectation for repayment exists, governments are more likely to trace the use of these resources and ensure that they are used in a productive manner. We test our hypothesis with data for 90 developing countries between 2000 and 2015. Utilizing exogenous variation to aid and loan flows, we find strong support for our hypotheses.	Jonas Bunte	NA
2019	85957	678	Foreign aid and domestic taxation systems	Does foreign aid strengthen or weaken domestic institutions in recipient countries? We examine the effect of foreign aid on tax systems in developing countries. Our theory makes use of the variation in the financial terms of aid (grants versus loans) and the identity of the donor (China versus the United States). We hypothesize that aid provided in the form of bilateral loans improves revenue collection, while aid in the form of grants undermines the performance of tax systems as loans must be repaid while grants do not. In addition, we hypothesize that donor identity matters for the types of taxes used. Western governments often emphasize reducing barriers to trade, which removes the ability to tax trade. To compensate, these recipients increase taxes on domestic income, profits, and capital gains. In contrast, assistance from emerging creditors such as China frequently requires recipients to purchase goods and services from the creditor country, prompting an increase in taxes on trade flows. Utilizing exogenous variation to aid and loan flows, we find strong support for our hypotheses.	Jonas Bunte	NA
2019	86466	1042	Politics and the Marketplace of Ideas: When Does Aid Fragmentation Help or Hinder the Achievement of Development Goals?	Aid fragmentation is widely condemned as a threat to aid effectiveness. However, empirical scholars have recently begun assessing whether fragmentation is as harmful as has been widely assumed. Though studies have shown that having more donors is negatively associated with bureaucratic quality and economic growth, more recent work suggests it can have beneficial effects when it comes to promoting child survival or democracy, and can reduce the risk for political destabilization. This paper attempts to reconcile some of these seemingly contradictory effects by investigating the relationship between aid fragmentation and progress towards achieving a variety of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using cross-national data on most developing countries from 1995 to 2013 and subnational data for selected countries, we show that aid fragmentation is beneficial for the achievement of SDG targets for which policy solutions are relatively uncontroversial (such as immunization). However, fragmentation’s benefits disappear when it comes to goals whose solutions tend to be politicized (e.g., HIV/AIDS).	Sebastian Ziaja	NA
2019	86513	1082	Does Foreign Aid Volatility Hinder Institutional Development in Recipient Countries?	Scholars and practitioners agree that effective political institutions play an important role in development, and large amounts of foreign aid are given with the goal of establishing and strengthening such institutions in recipient countries. However, the volatility of aid flows can hurt the very same institutional development they are meant to promote. Both unpredictability and variability in aid flows are harmful to institutions because they hinder long-term planning, bring about undesirable dynamics such as within-institution boom-and-bust cycles, and undermine the creation, survival, and development of stable, future-oriented institutions. I analyze aid unpredictability and variability in terms of fluctuations in total dollar amounts; difference between committed and disbursed amounts; but also in terms of source, sector, and type. Through a time-series approach I show that, over the course of decades, foreign aid volatility has increased; and that uncertainty and variability in aid flows is followed by stagnation or worsening of quality of governance and institutions in recipient countries.

2019	86209	849	Expert vs. Popular Perceptions of the Rule of Law and Corruption	For more than a decade, significant attention has been paid to problems with perception-based measures of the rule of law generally and corruption specifically, with many finding them wanting on both theoretical and empirical grounds. And while a handful of scholars have compared survey results of the public to the results of cross-national indices such as Transparency International, to date no research has examined expert and popular responses to the same surveys. In this paper we offer the first such comparison, examining in-country expert and popular perceptions and experiences with corruption in approximately 95 countries. We combine these cross-national results with a case study of corruption in China to derive preliminary hypotheses about the political and economic factors leading to divergence or convergence between expert and popular assessments, as well as offer suggestions for how to better ascertain when perception-based measures of corruption are likely to mislead.

2019	85955	677	The Persistence of Mafias	Mafia-type organizations dominate black market activities using violence and intimidation, exposing the inability of the state both to retain the monopoly of violence and to maximize social welfare. While such state failures might be unsurprising in low state capacity contexts, their persistence is puzzling in highly industrialized societies with democratic institutions. Two prominent examples are the Italian mafias and the yakuza in Japan. Why do mafias persist? We present a model of crime, corruption, and political transitions, which provides a unified framework for studying the impact of economic and political factors on the persistence of mafias. A key finding is that societies can sometimes be caught in 'crime traps' where law enforcement paradoxically increases crime. We embed this illegal sector equilibrium into a two-period model of policy-making with stochastic political transitions. According to the model, societies in crime traps that have dominant parties are more likely to have stronger mafias because dominant-party incumbents have an incentive to collude with the criminal sector and use law enforcement to consolidate that sector into a small number of powerful criminal organizations.

2019	86815	1218	Prohibition, Theft, and Violence	Why are black markets more prone to violence than their licit counterparts? Sellers in black markets face two problems largely absent from licit markets. First, they have no legal recourse if their product is forcibly stolen from them. Second, attempts at exchange may be punished by the authorities. In a simple model of monopolistic pricing, we show these forces interact to produce increased theft as prohibition enforcement increases. More broadly, we build a typology of exchange under anarchy, generalizing the standard model of monopoly under incomplete information (Maskin and Riley 1984) to settings featuring prohibition and theft.

2019	86569	1133	The Business Model of Mexican Cartels	How does a criminal organisation react to a sudden loss in expected revenues? Is their dominant strategy to offset the loss by diversifying their portfolio or will they try to conquer others’ businesses with the risk of causing a conflict? This paper aims to tackle this question by studying the effect of the US legalisation of Marijuana on the business model of Mexican Cartels. Specifically, we exploit a unique dataset on the presence of each Mexican Cartel in each US State and we combine it with precise information about the Cartels’ presence, type and level of violence in Mexican Municipalities. Our estimates exploit the staggered nature of pot legalisation in different US States. We employ a Difference in Differences strategy to retrieve the causal effect of this “business shock” on the level of violence and electoral results in Mexican municipalities.	Nicola Mastrorocco	NA
2019	86352	953	The Political Economy of Collusion: How Organized Crime Captures Political Institutions	The presence of organized crime has profound consequences on the economic and political life of a society. In particular, criminal organizations seek to cultivate a close connection to the political world to distort public policies to their advantage and bend rules and regulations restricting their ability to make profits in the legal economy. Despite these clear economic benefits, there is substantial variation in patterns of criminal infiltration of local governments in areas where criminal organizations are present. We seek to explain the determinants of infiltration in the context of Italian municipalities and we argue that it is driven by the variation across municipalities in economic benefits that criminal organizations can expect to extract following infiltration. We test our theoretical model using a difference-in-differences design that exploits exogenous shocks in economic opportunities due to post-earthquake relief, we show that criminal organizations are more likely to attempt and succeed in infiltrating municipalities that offer better economic opportunities. Moreover, as the potential economic benefit increases, criminal organizations use less and less what is commonly thought to be their main tool, violence against politicians.	Livio Di Lonardo	NA
2019	79931	90	Dynamic Responsiveness in Political Rhetoric	According the Thermostatic model of representation, the government updates its policies in response to the public, and in return, the public updates its preferences in response to government policy. We seek to expand the applicability of this model with new hypotheses, new data and new measures. First, we propose to analyze rhetorical responsiveness in order to analyze more issues, such as immigration and climate. Second, in addition to position, we also analyze attention as a means of responsiveness. Third, we develop a perceptual measure of public opinion using weekly opinion polls that report the public's party preferences. Fourth, we use large corpora of speeches by MPs and PMs from 8 countries to evaluate the thermostatic dynamics of representation. Combined with Eurobarometer data on public preferences, we analyze the responsiveness of elites to the public, and vice versa. In sum, the goal is to further evaluate the relevance of the Thermostatic Model as a theory of democracy and responsiveness.	Martijn Schoonvelde, Denise Traber	NA
2019	85745	557	Multidimensional Representational (In)Congruence in Europe	Ideological congruence is a key issue in studies of representation. However, established measures of congruence are often limited to a unidimensional political space, while recent theoretical contributions stress the importance of multidimensionality in congruence. I extend the typology of Golder \& Stramski (2010) to the multidimensional case and introduce a novel approach to estimating the many to many congruence under these conditions. Drawing on an online survey prior to the European Parliamentary elections of 2014, I jointly scale voters and parties and assess the level of multidimensional congruence across 27 European states. This approach is of interest to those studying representational congruence, while the application highlights the variance in congruence across EU states.	Garret Binding	NA
2019	85224	422	Controlling the Share? Party Control and the Gap between Representative Ambition and Distributional Outcomes in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland	Political parties have various political and representational ambitions. However, reality often reveals a gap between (representative) ambition (e.g. gender parity) and (electoral) outcome. Using gender quotas as example for an explicitly formulated ambition, we break new ground for the disentangled analysis of selection and election processes to show how key factors explain the size of this gap. We argue that the extent to which representative ambitions can be translated into electoral outcomes depends inter alia on the control of party elites over the selection as well as the election process. Using new detailed individual level data from all (N= ~40.000) candidates and elected MPs in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland (1982 - 2017) we first explain how gender quotas translate into selected candidates. Then we illustrate that the electoral system is a key factor explaining the difference between the candidates selected and the electoral outcomes.	Elena Frech, Tomas Turner Zwinkels	NA
2019	84969	392	Establishing Responsive Linkages between Politicians and Voters in Pakistan	This study assesses whether improved political communication can move politicians towards programmatic politics and away from clientelism. We report findings from a 2018 study conducted in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. We set up repeated communications between 14,400 voters and 20 randomly selected members of the provincial assembly (MPAs) using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology. Politicians scripted and recorded questions they deemed important to send out to a random sample of voters. We disseminated the recordings to voters' cell phones and aggregated responses. Politicians were then allowed to engage with voters with another phone call. Following the June 2018 election, we collected endline data. Our design allows us to study whether IVR calls changed polling station level outcomes (vote shares and turnout,) as well as whether politicians changed their efforts in targeted areas. It also allows us to disentangle effects on voters of getting a call from the incumbent from effects of asking for input into policy decisions. We compare outcomes in the constituencies of the 20 treated politicians with those for 20 control politicians.	Miriam Golden	NA
2019	86414	1001	Never Mind, I’ll Find Someone Like Me: The Relationship between Perceived Representation and Populist Attitudes	The rise of populism is often linked to representation gaps. Due to endogeneity between populism and perceptions of representation, this has been hard to test. We use an experiment manipulating voters’ perceptions of representation in order to identify their causal effect on populist sentiment on representative samples from 12 European countries (n = 24000). Respondents are first asked to state their preference on two EU policy issues. Next, they read a vignette about how major parties have sorted themselves on it during the European elections, which can indicate either that at least one party has taken the respondent’s position on that issue, or that no party has done so. We also vary whether parties have all taken the same position, or if they assumed different views from each other, and follow with questions on populist attitudes. These treatments affect representation in two ways: a) parties hold diverse positions, and b) at least one party advocates a position close to the respondent's. Results are the first causal test of whether the cartelisation of European parties contributed to recent populist successes.	Bruno Castanho Silva	NA
2019	82777	182	Motivated Reasoning or Motivated Guessing? Exploring the Partisan Factual Bias Under Uncertainty	Recent work has argued that respondents often guess the answer to political knowledge questions using partisan priors. Providing monetary incentives can decrease this partisan gap, presumably because it induces more even-handed guessing. We carry out two online experiments on adults in the US and the UK, whereby respondents are exposed to difficult partisan information, in order to test such partisan guessing. The first experiment randomizes whether respondents are offered a “Don’t Know” (DK) option, and whether it is encouraged, in order to separate “guessers” and “knowers”, as well as “timid” and “confident” guessers. The results show that the partisan gap only disappears when DKs are encouraged. The second experiment demonstrates that people are not necessarily aware that such guessing is biased. Using a different topic and sample, we show that only in the presence of both monetary incentives for a correct answer and awareness of the do respondents no longer guess in a partisan fashion. These results imply that the partisan factual bias might be largely driven by unstable “best guesses”, instead of expressive reporting or partisan motivated reasoning.	Vittorio Merola	NA
2019	86405	994	The broken link? Examining young people’s partisan socialisation within the home.	The past three decades have seen a dramatic decline in the proportion of people with a party identity. This decline primarily results from new cohorts who have lower levels of party identity than their predecessors. Once a cohort enters the electorate, levels of identification remain stable. These findings point to the importance of early experiences in shaping voters’ partisanship. This paper examines young people’s weakening attachments to parties, asking whether changes in socialisation can explain partisan dealignment. We use data on 11-15 year olds in the British Household Panel Study/Understanding Society (a household panel study spanning 26 years) to test demand-side explanations of dealignment among young people. Has increased female education and employment changed the socialisation of young people, due to different socialisation pressures in both workplaces? Did increased enrolment in higher education over that time period affect the expectations young people had for their future? Does declining sibship size also reduce political socialisation within the home? And is there a ratchet effect, where less partisan previous generations further fail to indoctrinate their children into a party identity?	Nicole Martin	NA
2019	85412	481	Don't Forget the Independents: Modeling Macropartisanship as a Compositional Time Series	Previous analyses of the dynamics of aggregate partisanship in the US -- Macropartisanship -- ignore the fact that partisanship is a multicategory variable that includes Independents. Instead, all previous analyses rely on measures that only include percenta ges of Democrats and Republicans. This is both theoretically unsatisfying and methodologically perilous. We rectify this oversight in this paper, modeling the dynamics in a way that is consistent with the true nature of the data structure. Extant analyses must assume that aggregate movements in partisanship consist of shifts from Republican identification to Democrats, or vice versa. Of course, this ignores that, oftentimes, a plurality of Americans consider themselves to be Independents. Ignoring this important reality makes existing analyses methodologically suspect and theoretically deficient.	Matthew Lebo	NA
2019	86463	1040	Issue opinion and the stability of political choices in mass publics	Prominent conceptions of democracy involve citizens choosing representatives based on their issue positions. However, past research casts doubt on citizens’ capacity to form ‘real’ attitudes toward policy issues and therefore suggests that stable political choices emerge more because of partisan or social identities. We use a new three-wave survey of the UK public to examine the extent to which citizens (a) hold real opinions – measured in terms of response stability – on each of 34 policy issues and (b) make stable multidimensional choices between candidates based on issue positions in conjoint experiments. We find that the stability of issue-specific opinion varies widely across issues, but that a number of issues exhibit high levels of stability that are comparable to canonical benchmarks such as party identification in the United States. We also find that citizens tend to put more weight on higher-stability issues when choosing between candidates and that their conjoint responses exhibit high stability over time. Together, our findings illustrate how citizens can make stable political choices based on issues opinions even when many citizens lack real attitudes about most issues.	Nick Vivyan	NA
2019	86514	1083	Party Principles: Commitment to Group-Specific Policy Proposals	The Democratic Party is often described as a coalition of interests that share a common commitment to use government to ameliorate societal inequities. In contrast, the Republican Party is characterized primarily by fealty to conservative ideological symbolism. Research shows that Democrats’ programmatic policy appeals engender greater attitudinal consistency among party elites and mass public identifiers, whereas Republicans often disconnect conservative ideological attachments from more liberal issue attitudes. In this paper, we propose and test a theory linking political sophistication to attitudes toward group-specific policy proposals designed to benefit particular social groups, namely African Americans, homosexuals and the poor. We expect that political sophistication increases Democrats’ support for group-specific policies, as greater awareness should foster non-group members’ willingness to help the party’s constituent groups and further the core value of equality. We expect that political sophistication will play no demonstrable moderating role in this relationship among Republicans because GOP principles do not demand accommodating group-based interests. Results from the 2008-2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) support our key hypotheses and illuminate divisions within and across the major American political parties.	Robert Lupton	NA
2019	86819	1219	Drain the Swamp? Constrained Political Choice in Brazil	We use municipal level data on votes and characteristics of candidates running for office in Brazil's chamber of deputies, to estimate the value voters give to the political alternatives they can actually choose from. The demand model allows for unobserved endogenous attributes that can be correlated with observable variables chosen by the politicians, such as position-taking. We recover the value that voters give to ideological proximity and observable characteristics of the candidates such as education and experience. We also provide an estimate of the surplus lost due to the constraints in political alternatives.	Matias Iaryczower	NA
2019	85951	674	Assessing Issue-Oriented Voting When Voters Have Nonseparable Preferences	Candidates in an election may benefit from introducing issues over which votershave nonseparable preferences. When some voters have nonseparable preferences, a candidate may move from a losing position to a winning position by moving further from the majority of voters in the policy space. Empirical studies of issue voting in elections will mispredict voter behavior when voter preferences are nonseparable. Data from 2004, 2012, and 2016 panel studies during US presidential elections show that a substantial percentage of voters have nonseparable preferences for many issues in the elections. A vote choice model that includes measures of nonseparable preferences and generalized Euclidean issue distances better explains the vote than a model with simple Euclidean issue distances.	Dean Lacy	NA
2019	84363	293	Expressive Political Choice	Why do so many voters choose parties that have very little chance of being elected to office and implementing the policies that they prefer? Most standard accounts of the voting behavior assume that people vote instrumentally, that is, they are motivated by the political consequences of election outcomes. Yet, theories of expressive voting suggest that voters can also derive intrinsic value from the very act of expressing support for a party that they identify with. Despite the burgeoning scholarly attention to the contrast between instrumental and expressive voting, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize and operationalize expressive voting. In this paper, we contribute to this literature by conceptualizing and measuring expressive voting explicitly as social identity-based. We argue that social identities shape vote choice even when voters are given information and incentives to vote instrumentally. We test this argument in a laboratory setting, using a version of the minimal group paradigm to unpack how group-identities shape voting. Our findings show that while individuals do vote instrumentally, even very weakly induced identities have a very powerful impact on vote choices.	Toni Rodon	NA
2019	87059	1232	Strategic voting in instant-runoff elections	The instant-runoff voting system (IRV, also known as AV, RCV, preferential voting, and single-winner STV) is used to elect legislators throughout Australia, mayors in London, San Francisco, and several other major cities, and (recently) members of Congress from the U.S. state of Maine. Advocates argue that IRV reduces voters' incentive to vote strategically compared to plurality, but that claim has never been rigorously assessed. Using new methods for calculating the probability of pivotal events in IRV elections and preference data from 160 election surveys, we show that (i) the proportion of voters with a positive incentive to vote insincerely is higher in IRV than in plurality but (ii) fewer voters have a substantial incentive to vote insincerely. We also show that IRV is more likely than plurality to choose the Condorcet Winner not just when voters vote sincerely (as is well known) but also when as many as half of them cast a myopic strategic vote.

2019	86533	1102	Vote Choice as a Two-Staged Process	A growing body of literature understands vote choice as a sequential political decision making process. However, empirical evidence mainly stems from single case studies and we have comparatively little evidence of the usability of such models across contexts. I use copulas and the concept of choice sets to develop a sequential, two-staged choice model in order to gain insight into the political decision making of voters. Voters only take information on vote choices into account if multiple alternatives remain. The model allows for both optimizing behavior and decisions that are only marginally rational. I formalize the model and apply it to data from the European Election Survey (EES) 2014. Thereby, we will gain detailed insight into the political decision making process of voters.	Thomas Willi	NA
2019	86580	1144	UnfAirbnb! The effect of short-term letting on electoral behaviour	Over the last few years, short-term lets or home sharing have radically changed the dynamics of mass tourism. In addition, the short-term holiday letting industry has also had profound consequences, positive or negative, in many urban spaces. Thus, short-term lets have been lucrative for some, but they have also changed many city's urban spaces and transformed the character of different areas, leading to evictions or displacing neighbours to the suburbs. While previous works have focused on the economic effect of short-term letting, much less is known about the electoral effects of the “Airbnb” phenomenon. Does it lead to a higher propensity to vote for certain parties, especially for those that own the issue? Does it lead voters to punish the incumbent? Or does it increase abstention? Using detailed geographic data on Airbnb locations in several Spanish cities and a difference-in-differences design, this article examines the effect of short-term letting on electoral behaviour. This study has important implications for our understanding of the interplay between urban management, social cohesion and vote choice.	Toni Rodon	NA
2019	86416	1003	National Sporting Success and Regime Stability: Evidence from participation in the FIFA world cup	It sometimes claimed that surges in national patriotism, brought about by national-team success in prominent international sports tournaments, should lead to internal political stability. Yet, the impact of such participation has not been adequately considered in current large-n research on regime survival. This paper explores how successful FIFA world cup performance, which is arguably a quasi-exogenous shocks in national patriotism, affects regime stability. We combine weekly data on all countries’ participation in the FIFA world cup since its inception, with dated regime-breakdown data. We find that the risk of regime breakdown drops significantly in periods where the given country participates in the FIFA world cup, and that this is amplified when a country performs successfully.

2019	86611	1167	Vote Switching and Racial Identity Change	Although research has begun to document and explain over time change in individual level racial identification, little attention has been paid to how this phenomenon---involving a variable widely assumed as temporally stable---relates to political factors. Using panel data with individuals' vote choices and racial identities recorded around the last two US presidential election periods, this paper demonstrates a strong relationship between vote switching patterns and racial identification change. Specifically, across several models and robust to various controls, switching into a 2016 Republican vote (i.e., non-Romney to Trump vote) significantly predicts nonwhite to white race change. For example, among original nonwhites who didn't vote Republican in 2012, switching to a Republican vote in 2016 doubles the probability of switching to a white racial identity. This systematic relationship cannot be ascribed to measurement error and makes theoretical sense in light of 2016 election candidate rhetoric and broader trends in political-social identity alignment.

2019	80092	93	When and how do governments manipulate their economic statistics?	A flurry of recent articles has reported statistical evidence suggesting that governments manipulate their official economic statistics. Emphasizing the identification of systematic biases in statistical outputs, these studies have succeeded in showing that the political manipulation of economic statistics does occur, but they have neglected the question of how it happens. To better understand the processes through which politicians interfere with the production of economic statistics, this article thus pursues an in-depth qualitative examination of three recent high-profile cases: Greece’s entry into the EMU, controversies about Argentina’s inflation statistics in the late 2000s, and the Brazilian “fiscal pedaling” scandal of 2014-15. We make two main contributions: First, we suggest drawing a distinction among four different types of manipulation - outright manipulation, politically motivated guesstimating, the opportunistic use of methodology space, and the strategic management of financial flows. Second, our case studies indicate that the political manipulation of economic statistics generally represents a strategy, which is high-risk, hard to implement and questionably successful. Overall, this leads us to somewhat more optimistic conclusions with regard to the integrity of official statistics.	Roberto Barbosa de Andrade Aragão, Lukas Linsi	NA
2019	85906	653	Direct democracy in representative systems: understanding breakdowns in responsiveness through ballot initiative success.	Why are ballot initiatives, a form of direct democracy, ever necessary in representative systems? While previous research focuses on the (causal) impact of various factors on initiative success, this paper addresses why such policymaking openings should ever exist in the first place. To answer this puzzle, we must shift our attention away from the differences between successful and unsuccessful initiatives and consider why legislators fail to respond to 'the people's' will. Using contributor-level ideological scores, this paper demonstrates that ideological support for successful initiatives tends to be more extreme than support for successful legislative candidates, while substantive correlations between party and initiative vote choice remain. Moreover, computing legislators' ideal behaviour using constituency-level vote breakdowns suggests that divergences between legislative and electoral preferences are not the result of mis-aggregation across districts. Legislators simply do not always act on the preferences of their district median voter. This paper contributes to a growing debate about representation and responsiveness in advanced democracies, and the use of direct democratic policymaking more broadly.	Thomas Robinson	NA
2019	85880	638	Cosmopolitan backlash: nationalism, insecurity and reactant response to foreign endorsements	Can foreign endorsements induce backlash reactions? The few existing studies on the effects of foreign interventions on public opinion and voting focus on democracy promotion and arrive at mixed conclusions. Others study national media endorsements specifically and find positive effects. This paper investigates whether different nationalities of the intervening authorities increase or decrease the probability of a negative (reactant) reaction. We conduct a survey experiment using a political endorsement. The treatment consists of manipulating the nationality of the endorsing authority. We test three competing hypotheses: (1) the reactant reactions to endorsements coming from historical ‘ally’ nationalities are weaker than those to the ‘enemy’ nationalities; (2) the backlash is similarly strong to all foreign advice – which would mean that it is aimed at all cosmopolitan elites; (3) the backlash is similarly strong to all advice, including national advice – i.e. it is aimed at all elites. Additionally, we explore whether different nationalities trigger mechanisms such as insecurity or nationalism, and whether the reactant reaction is moderated by the exogenous factor of living close to the country’s border.

We show that religiously divided communi- ties that experienced the Catholic counter-reform faced relatively stronger demand for legal mechanisms of conflict resolution and developed distinct in- stitutions of inter-religious mediation. We demonstrate that the creation of these institutions and the legalization of the religious conflict has a persistent effect to the present: citizens in localities that experienced counter-reform have a higher level of trust in political and legal institutions today. We also provide evidence that Protestant churches were an important vehicle for the transmission of institutional trust.

2019	86551	1118	Bullets and ballots: Exposure to terrorism and support for the incumbent	The effects of terrorism on support for the incumbent are still unclear. Building on models of retrospective voting, one should expect the incumbent to be harmed by voters’ exposure to terrorist violence. However, previous studies have identified “rallies around the flag” that are common in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. This mechanism might counterbalance retrospective voting by diluting clarity of responsibility and therefore terrorism constitutes a hard case for accountability. Empirically, we rely on time series cross-sectional data on ETA deadly attacks and election results of the national incumbent in Spanish municipalities during the period 1977-2011. Using municipality- and year- fixed effects models to control for various sources of heterogeneity, we find that the electoral losses of the incumbent substantially increase with proximity to terror attacks, although the effect is non-linear: the negative impact for the incumbent vanishes for medium levels of distance. The effect is stronger for attacks with a large deathtoll and weaker, if not absent, when victims are not civilians. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the functioning of democracies subject to terrorist violence.	Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Jordi Muñoz	NA
2019	87352	1248	The legacy of violence on political behavior: the case of the Spanish civil war in the Basque Country	The literature on violence has focused on explaining the causes, but we do not much about the consequences of such in democratic regimes. Political polarization and the rising nationalism are shaping western-European political systems. This paper analyses the consequences of different typologies of violence displayed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) on voting behavior during the democratic period (1981-) in the Basque Country. The empirical strategy is two-fold. First, unpublished geographically located data on aerial bombings and civilian deaths executed during the civil war at the municipal-level is employed to analyze voting behavior in municipal elections in Biscay during the democratic period. Second, this research uses survey data to uncover the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of the legacy of violence. Preliminary results show that these municipalities bombed by the Francoist army (1937) present a consistent margin in favor of Basque nationalist parties in local elections. Placebo tests using the Second Republic (1931-1936) elections results do not find this trend. Alternatively, survey data proposes respondent's permanence at antecedents' birthplace as the clearest mechanism of intergenerational transmission of the legacy of violence.	Sergi Martínez	NA
2019	84101	269	Public Opinion Following Terrorist Attacks	Do terrorist attacks change public attitude towards civil liberties? Or do politicians and political elites drive citizens’ responses to terrorism? To answer these questions, we use the occurrence of the London bombing (7/7/2005) during the fieldwork period of the British Social Attitudes Survey. We find that in the first week following the London bombings, British citizens did not change their attitudes on core civil liberties. Support for security enhancing policies that reduce, respectively, human rights, freedom of speech and privacy occurred with delay, in the following weeks, and then stabilize. We provide a number of explanations for these findings.	Mariaelisa Epifanio	NA
2019	86355	955	Do Terrorist Attacks Feed Populist Eurosceptics? Evidence from Two Comparative Quasi-Experiments	Over the recent years, Europe has experienced a series of Islamic terrorist attacks. We derive conflicting theoretical expectations on whether such attacks increase populist Euroscepticism in the form of anti-immigration, anti-refugee and anti-EU sentiment. Empirically, we exploit plausible exogenous variation in the exposure to the 2016 Berlin attack in two nationally representative surveys covering multiple European countries. We find no evidence for a populist response to the terrorist attack in any of the surveyed countries. On the contrary, people in Germany became more positive towards the EU in the wake of the Berlin attack. Moreover, we find little evidence that ideology shaped the response to the attack. Our findings suggest that terrorist attacks in the short term are not met by a public populist response.	Erik Gahner Larsen	NA
2019	86260	884	Becoming a Democratic Citizen. Quasi-Experimental Evidence on the Effects of Coming of Voting Age	The so-called 'impressionable years' are a crucial period of political socialization, a process by which basic political orientations are set which remain relatively constant over the life course. We add to the literature on political socialization, which has predominantly focused on context by investigating the role of a key event in adolescence and early adulthood. Using an innovative panel study of 3900 German adolescents, we study the role of first-ever eligibility in political socialization. Knowing our respondents' exact birth date, we estimate the causal effect of electoral eligibility on what are considered typical outcomes of political socialization in a regression discontinuity design. While we find no effect of eligibility on political interest, party identification or the acceptance of a duty to vote we do find a positive effect on political conversations and the usage of a voting advice application. Thus, our results suggest that as far as attitudinal outcomes are concerned political socialization seems mostly completed by the time citizens reach the age of eligibility. However, first-time eligibility serves as a trigger to act on these learned attitudes toward politics.	Arndt Leininger	NA
2019	95803	1270	Veterans and political change	What are the effects of war on individuals’ and groups’ participation in subsequent political transformations and conflicts? In our joint project, we examine this issue through cases as diverse as French soldiers in the American War of Independence, British veterans and the Great Reform Act, and Indian veterans after World War II. We address two important questions. First, there is a large and growing literature on democratization (Boix, 2003, Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000, Przeworski et al 2007, Ferejohn and Rosenbluth 2016) that focuses on the capacity of ‘the poor’ to affect change. But what explains the different capacities of disenfranchised groups to effect change, and how might individuals’ experience in wars explain variation in their participation in post-war reform and revolution? Second, in the many studies of variation in patterns of violence/ethnic cleansing during partitions and state transitions (e.g. Sambanis & Schulhofer-Wohl 2009, Chapman & Roeder 2007, Humphreys, Posner & Weinstein 2008, Kaufmann 1998) what effect might individuals’ previous experiences in war have in explaining variation in the observed patterns of violence?

2019	85248	429	Who continues to vote for the left? The effect of intra- and intergenerational social mobility on support for social-democratic parties in the UK, Germany, and Switzerland	This paper investigates how intra- and intergenerational social mobility affect support for social-democratic parties, focussing on the traditional and new strongholds of the left: production and service workers, and socio-cultural professionals. We expect the intergenerational transmission of class identity and party identification to play an important role in promoting social-democratic party support; and that changes and instability in the own occupational status over the life course can lead to volatility and demobilisation of (former) social-democratic voters. We investigate these hypotheses with longitudinal models, using household panel data from three countries (UK, Germany, Switzerland). The findings indicate that while father’s social-democratic party identity is an important predictor, intergenerational class mobility does not affect social-democratic party support, as class of destination is more important than class of origin. Moreover, in terms of intragenerational changes, workers who have experienced downward social mobility over the life course are more likely to support social-democratic parties than their immobile peers. These findings indicate that individual life-course changes are more influential than the class of origin in explaining these classes’ social-democratic party support.	Mathilde van Ditmars	NA
2019	84456	317	Self-interest or socialization? A panel study of the mechanisms connecting class and support for redistribution.	The connection between class and political preferences is among the most well-established in the social sciences. This association has often been taken as prima facie evidence of an economic self-interest mechanism. Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because they have different (economic) interests. However, class differences do not only reflect material interests, but also the residues of much earlier socialization as well as workplace characteristics. In this article we use mass survey panel data on thousands of respondents over a 16 year period to tease out the importance of these different mechanisms. We find evidence of some updating of economic ideology following intra-generational class mobility.	Peter Egge Langsæther	NA
2019	85839	608	Electorates’ Mind is for the Male Candidate; Negative Perception Towards Women Leadership Hindering the Performance of women Parliamentary Candidates in Malawi.	The paper discusses the nature of the electorates’ perceptions towards women leadership and the effects of the perceptions on performance of women parliamentary candidates in Malawi. The paper also uncovers the roots of the perceptions that are held towards female leaders. The paper draws from empirical evidence generated through qualitative design. The paper uses Zomba district as a case-study and focuses on two constituencies namely: Changalume and Zomba Central Constituency. The paper establishes that Malawians hold negative perceptions towards women leaders and these perceptions influence their choice of candidate when voting resulting into preference of a male candidate. Due to the negative perceptions that the electorates hold towards women leaders, the electorates would rather vote for male candidates than female candidates. The paper established four main perceptions that electorates have towards women leaders which are: women have low thinking capacity and poor decision-making skills, women are conforming and dependent,women are emotional and lastly women are more concerned with personal lives and are supposed to be home makers. The paper reveals culture and religion as the sources of these perceptions.	Samantha Soyiyo	NA
2019	75694	23	Gender and Political Suitability in the Irish Dáil. - A Goldberg Paradigm Experiment on the Perception of Legislators’ Suitability for Office	Historically, politics is an area of male dominance. Female representation has increased over the last decades, but women in politics, especially in high-profile political positions, are still underrepresented. In many countries, the increase of women in high-profile political positions is slower than expected. The literature exploring the relationship between perceptions of suitability for politics and women underrepresentation is few and vague. Are cultural barriers still present? How they interfere with perceptions of suitability for politics? By way of Goldberg Paradigm, I tested differences in attitudes towards male and female legislators in Ireland and I showed that men are perceived as more suitable legislators than women while there is a lack of trust in actual career chances for women. Comparing this result with a vignette experiment triggering gender issue, I found that when the interest for gender is revealed, suitability scores are affected and women show support for women politicians. On the contrary, they support men when the interest for gender is hidden. The result shows that cultural barriers still prevent women access to politics, especially in high-profile positions.

2019	82802	184	How Gender Matters: Voters' Attitudes about Men and Women in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Primary	What is the influence of gender attitudes on preferences for political candidates? Specifically, how did gender factor into the 2016 United State presidential election? Popular and scholarly accounts of the 2016 election have focused mainly other considerations to explain support for the U.S. presidential candidates. We argue, and find, that gender attitudes matter a great deal, but that their effects turn less on candidate sex than on a variety of specific gender-relevant characteristics of the candidates, including inhabiting or rejecting traditional gender roles, embracing or dismissing sexism as a problem in society, and exhibiting positive or negative affect toward women as a group. During the 2016 election primary, we asked a sample of U.S. citizens how they felt about all of the leading remaining candidates. We also measured three different types of gender attitudes among survey respondents. In our analyses, we probe the sources of citizens’ preferences in real election match-ups, contrasting those with hypothetical match-ups. This design gives us a fuller understanding of how citizens linked their attitudes about gender to candidates with varying sexes and gender-relevant characteristics.	Meri Long	NA
2019	83200	215	Does Gender Stereotyping Affect Women at the Ballot Box? Evidence from Local Elections in California, 1995-2016	Research demonstrates that many voters use gender stereotypes to evaluate candidates, but does that stereotyping affect women’s electoral success? In this paper, we try to make headway in answering that question by combining a novel empirical strategy with subnational election data from California. Our empirical strategy relies on two existing findings: first, that individuals are more likely to rely on stereotypes when they have less information about the candidates, and second, that the average voter in elections held concurrently with national elections has less information about local candidates than the average voter in off-cycle elections. We propose that we can therefore estimate the electoral effect of increased gender stereotyping by examining the difference in women’s win rates in higher-information (off-cycle) and lower-information (on-cycle) elections—and how that difference varies by constituency and the office sought. Our results show evidence of stereotype-consistent behaviors during on-cycle (low-information) races. We conclude that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how gender stereotyping affects female candidates, but rather that the direction and magnitude of the effect varies across institutional contexts.

2019	81185	118	Do Gender Quotas Enhance Countries' International Reputations?	The global spread of electoral gender quotas has been characterized as one of the most significant political developments of the last 30 years. The adoption of quotas has presented a puzzle to researchers given that many of the countries that have adopted these laws are (semi-)authoritarian countries that have otherwise-stark gender inequalities. Many scholars argue that such countries adopt gender quotas as a strategy for improving their international reputations. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored whether countries’ reputations actually do improve after quota adoption. This paper answers that question with evidence from large-scale survey experiments in both Sweden and the United States. The evidence suggests that respondents are more likely to support giving authoritarian countries foreign aid and perceive such countries as democratic when women’s descriptive representation is stronger. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of quotas, this paper also contributes to broader literatures on human rights and attitudes about foreign aid.	Sarah Bush	NA
2019	85391	477	On the Perils of Presidential Autonomy for the Institutionalization of European Party Systems (1848-2014)	The debate about whether presidential regimes or parliamentary regimes are better suited to democracy has elicited a substantial scholarly literature. Yet very few studies address the impact of presidential autonomy on the prospects for party system institutionalization—an essential condition for the consolidation of democracy (“presidential autonomy” refers to the two dimensions of (semi-)presidentialism—direct election and constitutional powers). Seeking to fill the gap, this paper aims to establish whether presidential autonomy is as perilous for party system institutionalization as the scholarly consensus would suggest. In particular, the paper tests some of the most important arguments advanced by scholars in the presidentialism/parliamentarism debate in light of the relationships between regime type and the development and institutionalization of party systems in new democracies. The paper starts with a quantitative analysis of presidential autonomy on the process of institutionalization in 72 European party systems since 1848. Qualitative cases are used to take a closer look at the mechanisms at work.	Till Weber	NA
2019	78661	78	Potent Executives: The Electoral Strength of Prime Ministers in Central Eastern Europe.	Prime ministers in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) are commonly perceived to be weaker than their Western European colleagues. This assessment relies on their comparatively shorter survival in office. However, the post-communist legacy of CEE provides a more favourable context for prime ministers to personally influence voting behaviour in parliamentary elections. I argue that the party system as well as the comparatively higher influence of elites over the media provide prime ministers in CEE with greater electoral potential than their West European counterparts. I study the leader effect of prime ministers across European countries to test this hypothesis using CSES data. I find that prime ministers in CEE have a stronger influence on vote choice than West European prime ministers. This presents a puzzle since prime ministers in CEE seem unable to use their comparatively higher electoral strength to secure their position in office. I discuss the implications of this finding for the presidentialization thesis and the survival of prime ministers.	Jan Berz	NA
2019	84712	356	Indirect presidential elections: A new classification and global summary, 1945-2018	The rules governing direct presidential elections and their consequences have been studied extensively. In contrast, indirect presidential elections – the selection of a republication head of state without immediate public involvement – have been almost systematically neglected by the literature. Most prominently, the literature on electoral systems identifies up to five different categories of direct presidential elections, whereas indirect presidential elections are compressed into just one (if they are discussed at all). The aim of this paper is to provide a first comprehensive comparative examination of the rules governing indirect presidential elections in democracies around the world. Therefore, it proposes a new classification of indirect presidential elections based on (1) selectorate composition, (2) majority requirements and (3) finality of the vote. A systematic assessment of original data on electoral rules since 1945 demonstrates that formulae for indirect presidential elections are far more complex than suggested by the existing literature and more varied than those governing popular contests. The results call for a re-examination of the current scholarship on presidential elections and the adoption of indirect elections into the canon of electoral studies.	Philipp Köker	NA
2019	84497	324	Political Corruption and Economic Growth	There is a scholarly consensus that political corruption distorts allocative and investment decisions, thereby reducing a government’s capacity and will to promote economic growth. Capacity and will, however, are double-edged swords. The power to push a society’s economy forward also is the power to crush alternative, economic bases of political power and, ultimately, to expropriate private capital. Political corruption can lower the risk of expropriation by giving government officials a personal financial stake in an expanding private sector. In this way, systemic corruption can serve as a second-best substitute for genuine property rights and aid economic growth. In this paper, we undertake a cross-country empirical analysis of this hypothesis. The key consideration is the extent to which a political-economic system combines high levels of corruption, weak formal property rights, and otherwise growth oriented policies allowing substantial private investor participation in the economy. Based on a micro-founded political-economic model of economic growth, we assess empirically the conditions under which authoritarian government, systemic corruption, and growth coexist.

2019	86052	727	Efficient but Crooked? Dilemmas and the Punishment of Corrupt Politicians	The coexistence of a harsh disapproval of corruption and the limited electoral consequences of malfeasant behavior is still a conundrum in social sciences. One of the potential explanations for this paradox is that citizens might value competence over honesty. Voters may forgive corrupt candidates when they are capable of “delivering the goods”. However, previous studies have not analyzed the effect of public decisions that involve a direct trade-off between honesty and efficiency. We put this hypothesis to a direct test through an experimental moral dilemma that clearly reflects this trade-off. In this experiment—included in a representative survey of the Spanish population—we examine participants’ evaluations and likelihood of voting for a politician that faces a moral dilemma in a public bidding process in which being corrupt leads to the most efficient outcome. In this dilemma the politician can either adopt a decision that does not follow the established legal procedure but leads to the optimal and welfare enhancing outcome, or she can adopt a decision that, even if it leads to a suboptimal outcome, follows the appropriate legal procedure.

2019	85677	532	Political Dynasties and Bicameralism: Aristocracy Creation and Democratization	Senates in bicameral legislatures have historically housed aristocrats. Can the institution also create a new aristocracy, enabling their survival under democratisation? This paper studies the evolution of dynastic links in the early years of the Dutch bicameral parliament. The peculiar circumstances of the creation of a bicameral legislature in 1815 allow us to assess the role of a senate in the evolution of dynasties in politics. After a long period of republican government, a national aristocracy was created and representatives were appointed to the senate by the king. These senators received the honour of being appointed to an upper chamber, in a legislature firmly controlled by the king with few actual powers for either chamber. Otherwise comparable political elites, whose representatives were indirectly elected to the House instead, form the control group. A difference-in-difference analysis confirms that the junior relatives of pre-democracy appointed senators were more likely to start or continue the dynasty than the relatives of the indirectly elected legislators. Senates can encourage democratic capture: The recently created aristocracy survived democratization in the elected lower chamber for some time.	Brenda Van Coppenolle	NA
2019	86292	907	SURE I VOTED FOR HIS FATHER: DYNASTICAL ADVANTAGE IN ELECTIONS - EVIDENCE FROM IRELAND	The effect of political dynasties on electoral outcomes has been widely discussed in the literature. However, the number of quantitative studies is very limited. Furthermore, existing studies have treated political dynasty as a binary variable and has ignored the variations in the relationship between relatives. We challenge this dichotomous operationalization and suggest the closer the relative, the bigger the impact. We also argue that relatives that hold different official positions (e.g., the prime minister, minister or Member of Parliament) have a varying effect on electoral success. In this study, analyzing the variation in political dynasties through different operationalizations, we examine general elections in Ireland. Ireland is an ideal case to study as it has a rich variation in the explanatory variable (around 20% of candidates has a familial relationship). In order to test our expectations, we analyze 24 general elections with more than 5,000 candidates from 1949 to 2016. To overcome model dependence and overfitting, we employ matching methods. Both in-sample analysis and out-of-sample cross-validation corroborate our expectations.	Kelsi Power-Spirlet, Oguzhan Turkoglu	NA
2019	84935	384	Partisanship and the Effectiveness of Personal Vote-Seeking	What are the consequences of partisan dealignment for legislative politics? Some scholars have suggested that dealignment should produce greater incentives for personal vote-seeking, by weakening party cues and making citizens more attentive to the qualities of individual legislators. However, existing empirical tests of this claim reach mixed conclusions. This paper thus provides a new test of this argument, asking whether the relationship between MPs’ parliamentary activity and their popularity is conditional on voters’ partisanship. I present the results of two complementary analyses. The first is a survey experiment, which manipulates respondents’ perception of an MP’s activity. The second is a quasi-experiment, exploiting the use of a random ballot in granting New Zealand MPs the right to introduce legislation. Both analyses suggest that more active MPs are more popular with voters. However, as expected, this relationship is moderated by voters’ partisanship. MPs’ parliamentary behaviour chiefly affects the evaluations of voters with the weakest partisanship. This supports the argument that partisan dealignment heightens politicians’ incentives for personal vote-seeking,	Thomas Fleming	NA
2019	85176	411	The construction of a Personal Vote and Political Particularism. Highlights from the Italian Chamber of Deputies.	Candidate-centered electoral systems incentivize politicians to cultivate a Personal Vote. Conventional wisdom on electoral systems and elected representatives’ behaviour tells us that the construction of a Personal Vote incentivizes Political Particularism. However, studies showing a direct connection between the construction of a Personal Vote and Political Particularism, using data on votes by candidates and candidates’ personal attributes, are still quite rare. In this analysis, I concentrate on Post-war Italy, whereby a candidate-centered open-list PR system was used to elect representatives to the Chamber of Deputies. In this context, 1) I produce an extensive data-set on Italian proposed legislation, Deputies’ personal characteristics and preference votes; 2) I build and validate four new dictionaries of Italian Political Particularism, that I use to code the newly-collected bill proposals; 3)I employ data on the preference votes gained by each Deputy to unpack the causal mechanism linking the construction of a Personal Vote to the promotion of particularistic policy-making. Results show that, irrespective of personal characteristics, party affiliation and ideology, legislators who constructed a large Personal Vote are more willing to propose particularistic legislation.

2019	86035	716	Not Competent, not Warm or just not Citizen Enough? Explaining Voter Discrimination against Immigrant-Origin Candidates	An emerging body of research suggests that discrimination against candidates with a migration background is prevalent across Europe, in particular among voters of right-wing parties. Why do some voters discriminate against candidates with a migration background? As an explanation, I consider voters who attribute negative stereotypes to immigrant-origin candidates, whereby I differentiate between trait stereotypes and stereotypes that depict said candidates as 'non-citizens.' While trait stereotypes, particularly beliefs about competence and warmth, have been influential to explain voter discrimination against other disadvantaged groups such as women or racial minorities, the second stereotype targets candidates with a migration background more specifically. In this latter explanation, voters reject immigrant-origin candidates as democratic co-citizens and attribute to them that they do not live up the nation's civic culture. To test these stereotypes, I rely on an original moderation-of-process survey experiment fielded in France and Italy, two countries that differ regarding attitudes towards immigrants and the perception of civic citizenship in the population.

Using large-N survey data, I employ an in-group versus out-group framework and a more well-rounded indicator which incorporates data on racial resentment, feeling thermometer, and racial stereotypes in two models to assess attitudes toward whites, blacks, and Hispanics in the first, and the addition of Asian-Americans in the second. I posit that the segments of the electorate who exhibited salient and negative racial attitudes would not have voted for the Democratic candidate, so their effect on the election was minimal at best.

2019	84384	298	Do Threats Galvanize Authoritarians or Mobilize Non-Authoritarians? Experimental Tests from 19 European Societies	Authoritarian predispositions and contextual threats are both thought to produce intolerance and prejudice towards immigrants and other minorities. Yet there is considerable dispute as to how authoritarianism and threats interact to produce an 'authoritarian dynamic.' Some scholars argue that threats increase intolerance by 'galvanizing' authoritarians. Others claim that authoritarians are always intolerant toward outgroups, with threat instead 'mobilizing' non-authoritarians. Using experimental manipulations of immigrant cultural threat embedded in nationally-representative samples from 19 European societies, this study offers a dispositive test of these competing hypotheses. While we find some evidence for the 'galvanizing' hypothesis, we find no evidence for the 'mobilizing' hypothesis. The effects vary considerably across national samples however, with immigrants from Muslim societies being particularly likely to activate authoritarian predispositions. These findings show how the migration of culturally distinctive groups has the potential to activate authoritarian dispositions, thereby pushing the issue of immigration to the center of political debates.

2019	85959	680	Effect of Dual Citizenship on Electoral Viability	Does the citizenship status of political candidates influence their electoral viability? Although some countries expressly prohibit dual citizens from holding public office, many do not. In countries without explicit bans on the practice, implicit biases among the electorate toward candidates with dual citizenship may still function as electoral barriers, particularly during periods of heightened nationalism. I examine this question using a conjoint survey experiment in which respondents choose between hypothetical pairs of candidates who vary randomly across personal attributes, including citizenship status. I find that political candidates who hold dual citizenship are not only less likely to be selected than their single citizenship counterparts, but that some dual citizenship candidates experience a larger electoral penalty than others. While these results shed light on the relationship between citizenship and electoral performance, they also speak to broader trends in Islamophobia and Antisemitism across the United States and Europe.

2019	85855	619	The role of candidates' personality in elections: evidence from a varying conjoint experiment	Scholars of personalization of politics claim that candidates’ and leaders’ evaluations are nowadays an essential part of voters’ electoral decisions. One of the alleged implications is that these decisions might be increasingly driven by the personal appeal of politicians at the expense of rational political reasoning. However, other strand of research suggests that voters might use personality traits as a shortcut to infer political information, essential to vote. This study tackles this issue by assessing whether candidates’ personality traits have an effect on voter’ decision making, and if so, whether this effect is cancelled out when political information is also available. Moreover, the study explores which candidates’ personality traits matter for voters, both when political cues are available and when they are not. The research design relies on a varying-conjoint experiment embedded in an original survey with 1,200 Spanish citizens. Results suggest that, in personalized contexts, voters’ decisions may not only be political, but that elections are at least partly a personality contest. This implies that traditional models of voting behavior should incorporate personality in the context of personalized politics.	Alberto López Ortega	NA
2019	85303	445	Does Issue Ownership Theory Apply to Individuals with Depressive Symptoms? Evidence from Self-Reported Depression and Political Perceptions in Spain	Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and among the most common mental health issues. Research on cognition and depression demonstrates that depressed individuals filter information and respond to stimuli in a negative way that is consistent with their idiosyncratic beliefs and assumptions. On the other hand, research on depression and political attitudes shows that depressed persons are on average more likely to identify with left parties, but leaves the question on what kind of party image would prevail (i.e. the affective-emotional or the policy-rational) open. This introduces a tension between how depressed persons perceive policy problems and how they structure their party choice. By using data from a new survey on political attitudes in Spain, we assess whether individuals with depressive symptoms have different perceptions on policy problems and whether issue ownership theory works as a mechanism of party choice. Our paper improves our understanding of how mental health shapes political perceptions.	Luca Bernardi	NA
2019	86799	1216	Neural nonpartisans	While affective conflict between partisans is driving much of modern politics, it is also driving increasing numbers to eschew partisan labels. A dominant theory is that these self-proclaimed independents are merely covert partisans. In the largest functional brain imaging study of neuropolitics to date, we find differences between partisans and nonpartisans in the posterior medial cortices, a portion of the brain’s Default Mode Network implicated in both our sense of self as well social cognition. These results suggest that rather than being mere covert partisans, nonpartisans process the world in a way that is distinct from their partisan counterparts.	Darren Schreiber	NA
2019	82434	166	Individuating versus Group-Related Components of the Self Concept: Implications for Party Polarization	We consider the psychological underpinnings of identity politics by examining how much party affiliation contributes to an individual's sense of self. We conceptualize the self as a 'tank'' filled with different inputs. One type of input is purely individuating characteristics, e.g., 'I am punctual.' Another derives from group affiliations, e.g., 'I'm a Democrat.' We theorize that these components of the self operate as a hydraulic system; when traits are made salient, group affiliations become less relevant. We test this expectation by experimentally manipulating the salience of traits. We supplement the experiment with a panel survey that captures naturally occurring variation in the salience of individuals' partisanship. Wave 1 occurred during the week of the 2018 mid-terms, and Wave 2 was fielded over the Christmas break. We anticipate that partisanship contributes more to the self than traits at Wave 1. We assess the impact of the experimental manipulation and naturally occurring changes in the political context on two sets of measures. First, we consider participants' ratings of their ideological and partisan identity. Second, we consider their evaluations of major party leaders.	Shanto Iyengar	NA
2019	86375	972	What Matters to the Public? Most Important Issues and Most Important Problems	'Most Important Problem' (MIP) survey questions have been criticized as measures of public salience, since 'problems' are not necessarily policy issues and what the public mentions may be driven by the topic's prominence rather than by its intrinsic importance (Wlezien 2005). Here we make use of a new version of the MIP question, which instead asks 'what is the most important issue on which you would like to see a change in what the national government is doing?” Responses from random samples of 1,000+ adults in four countries (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the US) are compared to responses to the standard MIP question from the same timeframe, as well as to mentions of the issues in the news media.

2019	86618	1173	Issue Emphasis and the slow process of policy formation in the context of U.K. Major Legislation	What explains the intra-party process for pushing issues onto a party’s agenda? At present, much of what we understand about policy formation focuses on issue emphasis, issue salience, and political parties responding to external issue preferences. Fundamental explanations of legislator and party behavior do little to explain exactly what motivates intra-party issue adoption and what factors result in raising an issue’s salience to prominence. This work fills a gap in the party politics literature by analyzing a moment far earlier in the agenda setting process – first, what motivates individual politicians to take up new issues, then push those issues onto their party’s agenda, and lobby for legislation. Using a major legislation case in the UK (the National Minimum Wage Act of 1998), I scrape issue mentions from parliamentary institutions (written PQs and floor speeches) combined with public opinion data to study the effect of emphasis on issue raising and policy-making. Following a detailed analysis of the legislation's formation, I find that successful issue adoption stems from a combination of intra-party lobbying as well as public pressure.	Christine Sylvester	NA
2019	82885	189	Government Agendas, Party Agendas and Niche Party Success	In this paper, we argue that government agendas will affect the fortunes of niche parties differently from party agendas because they can be related to different types of niche party appeals. When other political parties emphasize the core issues of niche parties (such as immigration for the radical right) this will increase the salience of these issues and should strengthen the niche party. Government agendas, however, play an additional role: they signal the responsiveness of governments. When niche parties can successfully argue that governments are ignoring their issues (especially when these issues are potentially salient among the public) then their anti-establishment appeal will be more credible and help them attract voters. Hence, ceteris paribus party agendas and government agendas should affect niche party fortunes in opposite ways. We empirically test these expectations combining data on both government agendas and party agendas from the Comparative Agendas Project with individual level data from the European Social Survey. We cover seven countries (UK, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark) from 2000 to 2016.	Christoffer Green-Pedersen	NA
2019	85703	544	Party Rhetoric and Issue Ownership	How does party rhetoric affect voters’ perceptions of party issue ownership? As party identification has weakened across advanced democracies, attention has turned toward understanding how parties discuss certain issues to reinforce their ownership of those issues, or to steal away issues from other parties. Yet, despite this growing literature, we currently lack a thorough comparative understanding of how parties’ rhetoric can affect public’s perceptions of their ownership on various issues, how party rhetoric on the issues they (or other parties) own affect voters’ evaluations of political parties and their leaders, and their eventual vote choice. Using the new Comparative Campaign Dynamics dataset, which codes party campaign issue and valence discussions in 10 European democracies during the one-month election campaign periods in two recent elections, as well as post-election survey data, we examine these effects of party rhetoric on voter perceptions and behavior. These results have important implications for our understanding of party strategies, and the linkages between parties and voters.	Laron Williams	NA
2019	86294	909	The relationship between issue saliency, public satisfaction and (health) policy reforms	The relationship between public opinion and public policies lies at the centre of representative democracy. Policy and public responsiveness scholars have showed that on the one hand public support for government spending affects the generosity of social programs and on the other hand citizens thermostatically adapt their demands to (de)increasing social spending. Similarly, I expect governments to reform the health system when health care is a highly salient issue and when public satisfaction is substantively low. Likewise, reforms are expected to reduce individuals’ concerns and increase their satisfaction. Employing a newly collected innovative dataset of health reforms in 32 European countries since 1990, bi-annual Eurobarometer data on health care saliency, and 7 waves of ESS data on satisfaction with health services, I test empirically the recursive relationship between policy reforms and public opinion. Preliminary analysis indicates a bidirectional relationship between reforms and both satisfaction with and saliency of health care. This study has important implications for the literature on public responsiveness and representative democracy and makes a substantive empirical contribution to recent debates on the politicization of health care.

2019	86483	1056	The Incumbency Advantage vs. the Winner Advantage: Examining the behavior of the runners-up	A large literature has focused on the estimation of the effect of being the incumbent (vs. being the runner-up) on winning subsequent elections. How do the estimates and the interpretation of these effects change once we allow politicians to move horizontally (i.e to run for the same office in other locations) or vertically (i.e. to run for other offices)? We formally define the concept of an overall winner advantage, which allows for such movements. We illustrate both types of potential career movement with electoral data for the UK Parliament and for Brazilian state legislatures. For the UK, we find that runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected in a different parliamentary constituency in the following electoral cycle. Among Brazilian state legislators, runners-up are more likely than winners to be elected for other posts (local councillor and mayor). Ignoring this phenomenon would lead to an overestimate of the overall advantage of being the winner.	Salomo Hirvonen	NA
2019	85775	571	Incumbency Advantage in Open versus Closed list: Evidence from Colombia	Differences in electoral systems are a first order hypothesis on what explains differences in incumbency advantage across countries. However, any comparisons drawn from cross-country estimates of incumbency advantage are always vulnerable to the following critique. Differences in incumbency advantage across countries may be due to differences in country specific covariates, some of which may be unobservable. The main contribution of this paper is to discuss the case of Colombia, a country in which we can produce estimates of incumbency advantage for different electoral systems within the same country at the same time. In every local election in Colombia each party chooses between two electoral systems: an open list or a closed list. We use regression discontinuity design to estimate and compare the personal incumbency advantage in both systems and find no difference between list types. However re-running effect is higher in open lists. This is consistent with a model where only open list candidates learn their type from individual votes. Robustness checks are employed in order show that our result are likely driven by the list type.	Salomo Hirvonen	NA
2019	85785	576	Competent Candidates in Opposing Party Strongholds: Effect of Past Party Performance for RDD Estimates of Incumbency Advantage	I show that Regression Discontinuity Design estimates of incumbency advantage are negatively correlated with past party performance in an election district. In 11 out of 14 offices from 10 different countries the RDD estimate of party incumbency advantage is higher in samples restricted to constituencies where a party had a negative winning margin in previous election compared to the whole sample or constituencies where the party has been winning. In order to show that this is not driven by period specific shocks, different measures of past party performance are used. This result holds at the candidate level for US Mayor and Gubernatorial elections. Thus, it is consistent with a model where a candidate running in an opposing party stronghold must have a valency advantage in order to get into a close election sample and valency is positively correlated with incumbency advantage. As typically election districts are not distributed symmetrically in terms of party vote shares, it contributes to the magnitude of incumbency estimates. Moreover this 'sample selection' serves as a test for the relationship between valency advantage and incumbency advantage.	Salomo Hirvonen	NA
2019	86462	1039	Challenger Quality as a Moderator of the Incumbency Advantage in Personalized PR Systems	How does the quality of list competitors affect the incumbency advantage? We argue that incumbents are less likely to benefit from holding office when list competitors are well-known and of high quality. To test this mechanism, we exploit the special 'dual mandate' characteristic of Irish local elections. Until 1999, members of the national parliament (TDs) were allowed to be represented in local and national parliaments simultaneously. By applying the regression discontinuity design to local elections between 1942 and 2014, we demonstrate that marginally elected politicians perform significantly worse when a TD competes for votes on the same list. Moreover, the incumbency advantage has become larger after the dual mandate was abolished. Our results highlight the moderating impact of high-quality competitors on the incumbency bonus.

2019	86193	837	Do Mayors Hurt Their Party? Local Incumbency and Performance in General Elections	We would expect political parties to benefit electorally from their control over local governments in general elections unless their performance in the local government is perceived as markedly negative by voters. One way to empirically analyze the impact of local incumbency on general elections is to employ RDD (regression discontinuity). However, the fact that boundaries of electoral districts in local elections differ most of the time from general elections’ complicates the analysis, especially if electoral mobilization can be targeted to competitive districts. By using data from Turkey where four different general elections with three different aggregation rules took place following the 2014 local elections, I try to disentangle the effect of electoral competitiveness at different levels on parties’ mobilization strategies and, in turn, on general election results. As expected, I find that local incumbency’s effect depends on the competitiveness of the general elections at the level in which votes are aggregated and turned into seats.	Ozge Kemahlioglu	NA
2019	85342	459	If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands: measuring the coalition mood using nonverbal communication in the legislature	The mood among coalition partners in multiparty governments may vary over time. The enthusiasm and unity after a government formation process may turn into frustration and anger, when the collaboration in government is not working well. Yet, these systematic and time-varying differences between multiparty governments have hardly been taken into account to assess the success and stability of multiparty governments. In this paper, we analyse how the coalition mood, defined as the atmosphere between government parties, affects government stability. We use applause for coalition partners in plenary debates of the legislature as a time-varying and party-specific measure of the coalition mood based on the nonverbal behaviour in the legislature. Based on an automated analysis of over 200,000 plenary debates in Germany (1991-2013) and Austria (2003-2018), we show that 1) the initial level of support for the new coalition government varies significantly across cabinets and that 2) a declining coalition mood indicates higher risk of early government termination.

2019	87032	1231	Facing the Electorate: Computational Approaches to the Study of Nonverbal Communication and Voter Impression Formation	Politicians have strong incentives to use their communication to positively impress and persuade voters (McGraw, 2003; Landtsheer et al., 2008). One important question that persists within the fields of political science, communication, and psychology, however, is whether appearance or substance matters more during political campaigns. To a large extent, this appearance vs. substance question remains open and, crucially, the notion that appearance can in fact effectively sway voter perceptions is consequential for the health of democracy. This study leverages state-of-the-art advances from the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and computational linguistics to expand our knowledge on how visual, tonal, and nonverbal elements of political speech-making influence how voters construct and maintain impressions of political actors. We rely on video and transcripts from the 4th Republican Party presidential debate held on 10 November 2016, as well as continuous response approval data from a live focus group (n=311; 62,229 reactions), to determine how emotional and stress displays of political candidates influence voter impression formation.

2019	83096	202	Beyond text as data: Computer vision in political research	Automated text analyses have become a cornerstone of political research. Following the interest in the ideological leaning and substantive focus of political texts, scholars have since made commendable efforts to tease out ever more subtle information from texts, such as patterns of political conflict. Despite their undeniable value, these analyses often engage with data that is unnecessarily remote from the concept of interest. One example is the study of legislative speech, where crucial information is lost in the transcription. We argue that automated video analyses constitute an important way forward, as video data can pick up more relevant cues. To trace this claim, we analyze video footage from the US Senate in two case studies. The studies take on the issue of dramatization in legislative speech, specifically the dramatization in high- vs. low-stakes debates and interpersonal differences in oratory quality. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning approaches which incorporate a variety of cues, such as body pose, facial expression and vocal pitch. We evaluate the proposed architecture with manually annotated video footage and assess how textual measures compare to our estimates.	Dominic Nyhuis	NA
2019	85406	480	The Economic Consequences of Populists in Power	What are the economic consequences of populists as government leaders? While some populist leaders focus on economic issues, others focus largely on cultural issues. Yet despite their substantive differences, populists share a personalistic style and attempt to subordinate institutions to their wills. To retain personal legitimacy, we argue that populists will take extra measures to ensure that economic performance remains strong while they are in office. Consequently, they will be more willing than other democratically-elected leaders to attack institutions like independent central banks which may restrain growth and will increase the debt burden on the country to fuel growth. But while these policies have a positive short-run impact on growth, they have a negative long-run impact. Therefore we expect that economic growth under populist leadership will be more volatile than under non-populist leadership. Limiting our focus to democracies and drawing on a new database of 46 populist leaders from around the world from 1990-2016, we find that populist leaders are associated with greater reductions in central bank independence, higher debt growth, and more volatile economic growth than non-populist democratically-elected leaders.

2019	78985	79	Direct Democracy and Government Spending	There is a long list of contributions arguing that direct democratic institutions go together with lower government spending. While this finding is hardly contested for the late 20th and early 21st century, it might not have always been like this. Most notably, Matsusaka has shown that before WWII, cities in the US with direct democratic elements tended to have higher spending. We examine this 'Matsusaka paradox' by differentiating between the effects of direct democratic institutions allowing to block legislation and institutions enabling actors outside the legislative and executive to propose new laws. In addition, we analyse how the representative system, in which direct democracy is embedded, shapes these instruments' effect on state spending. Based on almost 200 years of fiscal and political data from Swiss cantons, we exploit the different moments of introduction as well as the varying degree to which these institutions existed to examine the effect of direct democracy on government spending. We show that the distinction between blocking and enabling institutions in interaction with the representative systems helps to account for the Matsusaka paradox.	André Walter	NA
2019	87217	1243	Designing Policy Responses to Financial Crises: The Mass Politics of Austerity	In the aftermath of the Financial Crisis, governments in many advanced economies responded by adopting tough austerity measures in any attempt to reignite growth. Such spending cuts and tax hikes often proved highly contentious, and in some countries the backlash led governments to change course. We study voter preferences over government responses to crises, and in particular the desired composition of economic reforms. Using experimental data from Greece, Italy, France, Spain, and the UK, we document considerable heterogeneity across both left and right in voters' sensitivities to different types of spending cuts and tax increases. Based on these results, we develop an analytical tool that allows policymakers to gauge the popularity costs of austerity measures relative to their expected budgetary impact. Our methods helps identify which combination of reforms promises to be both fiscally effective and more politically acceptable, while taking account of the specific sensitivities of each electoral base.

2019	85981	692	Global Financial Crisis, Inequality, and Politics of Taxation in OECD countries	The average top personal income tax rate in OECD members started to rise after the global financial crisis of 2008. The tax increase is a new phenomena compared to the continued corporate and personal income tax cut since 1980s as a result of the race-to-the-bottom tax competition among advanced industrial democracies. Taxing the rich becomes an important political agenda in many countries with rising inequality. This study investigates the political factors affecting the tax policies of OECD members after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Previous literature on tax competition shows that the change of tax policy is conditioned by political environments such as partisanship, veto players, consensus democracy, etc. Different from the neoliberal convergence hypothesis predicting the demise of partisan politics, we found that the government partisanship is a critical factor explaining the political logic of taxing the rich. A left-wing government is more likely to increase the personal and corporate income tax rate. However, the effect of partisan politics is significantly weaker among the high-income OECD members than among the mid-income countries.	Hyeon Seok Park	NA
2019	83917	246	Political preferences in social interactions	Political-preference research is increasingly criticized for individualist explanations and the omission of social contexts. At the same time, traditional survey instruments to measure preferences are met with skepticism. Concerns are, inter alia, the risk to mistake non-attitudes for real preferences or to distort preferences through arbitrary wording choices. Also interest in the multi-dimensionality of policies has demonstrated the limitations of traditional survey items. Based on these concerns, we will study support for redistributive policies in group discussions. Such discussions are the setting in which people typically experience politics in everyday life. The design allows studying how people reason outside the constraints of pre-defined survey items, how they weight different aspects of redistributive policies and how they justify preferences. Going beyond the content of conversations, we are interested in their emotional quality. By non-obtrusively measuring the affective resonance of talking about preferences (through tools from conversation analysis and psychology of emotions), we hope to gain deeper insights into the strength of support as well as into how social contexts facilitate or constrain the expression of preferences.

2019	85867	629	Higher benefits, but at what cost? Introducing different trade-offs in the measurement of social policy preferences	Most comparative surveys provide data on citizens’ positions regarding social policies and redistribution, yet these questions do not take into account that, in today’s context of constrained public budgets, it is frequently not possible to implement all desirable social policies at the same time. Expanding benefits for some groups will frequently come at the expense of lower social benefits for others. Thus, we need to develop better measures that assess which social policy aims voters value higher. In this paper, we implement and compare three kinds of measures that capture social policy priorities: conjoint experiments, rating questions, and explicit trade-off questions. These novel items are part of a survey fielded in 8 European countries, and allow us to measure how much voters value a welfare benefit, dislike a cost (or opportunity cost) and how they decide when the two are pitted against each other. Moreover, by comparing them to conventional measures we are able to unveil inconsistencies, asymmetries, and ambivalence masked in these common measures. We further study heterogeneity in how these novel items perform among different socio-economic groups.	Macarena Ares	NA
2019	86178	826	Is international solidarity a question of economic or cultural left-right ideology? A conjoint experiment on public support for European unemployment insurance in 13 EU member states	In the aftermath of the euro crisis, policy makers and researchers have become increasingly interested in the establishment of European unemployment insurance schemes to enhance the stability of the European Monetary. We contribute to the scholarly debate on whether public support for European unemployment insurance is mainly a question of economic or cultural ideology by emphasizing the multidimensional nature of European social policy. Existing policy proposals reflect differing conceptions of European solidarity and vary with regard to the level of administration of the scheme, the extent to which it precludes permanent redistribution across participating countries, and the conditions attached to receiving support. We expect economic ideology to interact predominantly with attitudes towards domestic redistribution and with their conditionality; we expect cultural ideology to interact predominantly with cross-country redistribution and administration of the scheme. We use a conjoint analysis fielded in 2018 in thirteen European member states to test our hypotheses.	Francesco Nicoli	NA
2019	85794	581	(Unequal) responses to inequality: The structure and origins of redistributive preferences across advanced democracies	An important aspect of politics is “who gets what”. That is, redistributive politics and economic (in)equality play an important role in advanced democracies. While scholars pay ample attention to the relationship between inequality and redistribution, we know relatively little about how this relates to citizens. This study begins to fill this empirical gap by engaging in a twofold analysis of the structure and origins of redistributive preferences across advanced democracies. First, we examine if, when and how the redistributive preferences differ across income groups. A time-series cross-sectional analysis of data on aggregate redistributive preferences from seven advanced democracies (1980s-2017) rejects the common notion of parallel movement between issue publics and establishes a more heterogeneous change pattern between these groups. We subsequently scrutinise the origins of the redistributive preferences of different income groups by relating them to inequality. Here, we focus on how middle- and higher-income strata respond to inequality, and what the ramifications are in terms of democratic representation. What role does inequality play in explaining redistributive preferences and the preference gap between income groups?	Steven Van Hauwaert, Xavier Romero	NA
2019	82513	168	Who’s to blame? How financial crises and technocrats change (or not) the welfare state in Europe	Since the 2008 financial crises the appointments of technocrats in parliamentary cabinets has more than doubled. At the same time most European governments adopted fiscal austerity with important consequences for their welfare states. How much of this effect is due to the financial crisis and how much is it due to the specific ministerial appointments? Using data from 13 European countries since 1980 and two-stage least square models, we test the effects of financial crises and of technocratic appointments on a battery of social welfare indicators. Initial results indicate that technocrats appointed in the finance portfolio have real effects on social welfare policy, controlling for financial crises. However, these effects are not unconditional. While technocrats appointed by right of center parties are associated with large cuts in welfare and pension generosity, technocrats appointed by left parties are not. Perhaps surprisingly, experienced ministers of right of center parties with a background in economics are associated with larger cuts in government expenditure than technocrats.	Despina Alexiadou	NA
2019	83926	250	Does Austerity Cause Polarization?	Most party systems have seen a significant rise in polarization during the past decades. This paper shows that austerity policies significantly contributed to this development. Our analysis of 180 elections since 1980 finds that austerity and polarization are strongly related, especially if a left government implemented austerity policies. Survey experiments with a total of 8'000 respondents in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Portugal show why this is the case. If a right-wing government implements austerity, then dissatisfied voters mostly turn to the main left opposition party. If, however, a left-wing government implements austerity, then dissatisfied voters turn towards small, non-mainstream parties or abstain from voting because the right opposition does not provide a credible anti-austerity alternative. Our results disconfirm the common conjecture that left governments are punished more strongly for austerity. Government partisanship matters nonetheless because voters resort to different alternative parties under left and right governments. Austerity, thus, is not only is politically costly for governments in the short term, but it can also have profound and lasting effects on party systems through its impact on polarization.	Evelyne Hübscher	NA
2019	85268	433	Popular Austerity	We contend that it is possible to design an austerity programme such that (a) its costs are relatively focused on an electoral minority of the population – indeed one that potentially was not likely to vote for the governing party, anyway – and (b) there are large and widespread perceived benefits of the programme in terms of reducing government budget deficits and levels of debt. As such, it is possible to construct a coalition in support of austerity in something akin to a mirror image of the Olsonian logic of concentrated costs and distributed benefits being a political loser. We argue that this distributional pattern can be politically very effective when the costs are concentrated on the politically impotent and the benefits are felt by the politically important. We use evidence from the UK to empirically demonstrate our argument.	Timothy Hicks, Lucy Barnes	NA
2019	85382	476	We’d rather pay than changeThe politics of German non-adjustment in the Eurocrisis	Germany’s large current account surplus has been widely criticized, especially against the backdrop of the Eurozone crisis. We argue that Germany’s resistance to reduce its massive current account surplus is rooted in distributive struggles about the design of possible adjustment policies. In contrast, interstate financing is much less controversial, turning it into a politically more expedient choice. Using evidence from original survey data from 􏰉􏰊􏰋 German economic interest groups, qualitative interviews with interest group representatives and policymakers, and data from public opinion surveys, we show that while there is general support for internal adjustment among German interest groups, they disagree heavily about how to achieve this goal. Together with a broad public and elite-based consensus to avoid a break-up of the Eurozone, this polarization turns financing into the politically most a􏰌ractive strategy. Rather than being rooted only in German ordoliberal ideas or Germany’s export-oriented structure, distributive conflicts contribute significantly to Germany’s resistance to reduce its large current-account surplus. This phenomenon can also be observed in other surplus countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands shows.	Stefanie Walter	NA
2019	86529	1098	What Do Citizens Think About Fiscal Austerity? A Cross-Country Analysis	To prevent fiscal problems or even a sovereign default, there is a simple 'medicine': cutting public expenditures and/or increasing taxes. Apart from the issue that this fiscal medicine may have adverse effects on the economy (e.g. on economic growth), there may also be adverse effects for those policymakers which have decided to implement austerity measures. The conventional wisdom says that a policy of fiscal austerity will most likely be 'punished' by citizen-voters at the ballot box. Using cross-national public opinion data, this paper investigates what citizens in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world think about this policy issue. Is fiscal austerity really so unpopular? It turns out that fiscal austerity currently is generally supported by majorities of respondents in a number of highly indebted countries. However, public support decreases significantly when citizens are asked regarding spending cuts in specific budget areas which may decrease their current standard of living. This leaves policymakers under fiscal pressure with the crucial issue of how to cope with this striking paradox of 'Austerity yes, but not in my backyard'.	Karsten Mause	NA
2019	86267	890	Conflict or Crime? How victimization shapes preferences for public goods provision in Liberia	Citizens who have experienced civil conflict are often victims of both conflict related violence as well as crime. Yet, the literature often treats victimization homogeneously. The war victimization literature demonstrates that victimization leads to pro-social behavior, whereas the crime victimization literature is mixed on its effects on public goods preferences. Disaggregating victimization into separate categories, we argue that both types of victimization increase individuals’ demands for public goods, due to increased needs. Yet, while conflict victimization is linked to a collective experience, crime victimization is individual, and when it comes to the trade-off between social versus security policy preferences, we expect crime victims to place greater emphasis on law and order instruments. We analyze public goods preferences with original survey data from rural Liberia. Comparing the types of victimization in a multinomial regression, we find support for our argument that conflict victims are more supportive of social policies and basic public goods than crime victims who foremost value investment into security measures. Our results show the importance of a disaggregated approach to understanding the effects of violence.	Sarah Berens	NA
2019	86297	912	Unemployment and Social Policy: Preferences for Investment Versus Consumption	While extant studies of redistribution politics provide explanations of “who” supports redistribution, little is known about “what” is supported. This omission is unfortunate since government spending has different functions and impacts and the differences are undistinguished in the existing research. By capturing individual preferences regarding a specific types of government policy under the condition of unemployment, we assess how economic insecurity produces varying demands for government action. Building on the analytic distinction between social consumption and social investment (Beramendi et al., 2015), this paper examines the role of unemployment in social policy preferences. First, unemployment experience drives individual demand for social consumption and reduces support for investment. Second, the effect of income on social consumption is negative yet appears positive on social investment. Third, the effect of income is conditional on the experience of job loss, which is pronounced among lower income groups. The analysis of European Social Survey Wave 8 (2016) finds empirical evidence supporting arguments about the impacts of economic insecurity on individual preferences for a particular type of social expenditure.

2019	86563	1127	The Effects of Tax-Embedded Policies on Public Views of the Welfare State	The increasing use of the tax code to achieve social-policy goals in the U.S. and other countries may have important consequences for the politics of public policy. For instance, Mettler (2010) argues that receiving benefits through the tax code rather than more visible direct subsidies makes individuals less supportive of redistributive policies and less likely to view the tax system as fair. In this paper, we test how and why tax embedding government programs affects public opinion using two survey experiments on a renpresentative sample of the U.S. population. In the first experiment, we explore whether priming individuals about the government programs they received, either tax-embedded or direct-spending, affects their views on redistributive policy and the mechanisms by which any effects occur. In the second experiment, we manipulate the details of a vignette to explore how the form in which benefits are received affects the respondent’s views of the beneficiaries of government social programs. Our results expand our understanding of how the design of government social programs affects political views and the mechanisms by which these affects occur.	Alexander Tahk, Susannah Tahk	NA
2019	86344	947	The role of income-group preferences and inequality on redistributive policies	The extent to which governments respond to public opinion has been at the heart of a vivid scholarly debate over the past decade. While some research suggests that governments respond to changes in mass preferences, an increasing number of scholars claim that governments either disregard public opinion in general or are only influenced by the opinion of the wealthiest segments of the population. Given the central role of redistribution in European politics, this paper examines whether governmental redistributive policies respond to public opinion demands using a time-series cross-sectional analysis of data on aggregate redistributive preferences from seven advanced democracies (1980s-2017). We rely on a large dataset of survey data to estimate country-year measures of support for redistribution among different income groups to measure different levels of support for redistribution between the wealthy and the poor as well as between their influence on government action. The results shed light on the influence of group preferences and inequality on policy and allow for a critical evaluation governmental responsiveness to public demands.	Xavier Romero-Vidal	NA
2019	83345	217	Measuring Populism across Latin America using Expert Surveys	Using the 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey wave, in a recent publication Polak et al. (2017) find that the salience of anti-elite rhetoric is a function of party ideology. Although the authors are careful to not equate anti-elite salience with populism, they nevertheless underscore that anti-establishment rhetoric is a core element of populist parties. We contrast their measure with a more full-fledged measure of populism based on the ideational approach (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser 2018) and report findings for an expert survey of 158 political parties and 18 presidents in 18 Latin American countries. The results for this region of the world echo those reported for European countries insofar as anti-elite rhetoric appears to be a function of party ideology. The ideational approach, however, emerges as orthogonal to the general left-right dimension. Thus, relying on anti-elite rhetoric as a proxy for populism runs the risk of confusing ideology with populism. Finally, we contrast levels of populism with a measure of charismatic leadership and characteristics of party organization.	Saskia Ruth-Lovell	NA
2019	83758	239	Honourable people and evil elites? The use of moralizing language in populist discourse in the European Parliament, 1999 – 2014	This paper aims to enhance our understanding of populism by showing the importance of moralization in populist discourse. I argue that established theoretical assumptions, i.e. the construction of the people as morally superior and of the elite as evil, should be considered more thoroughly when measuring populism. The moral distinction between these two antagonist groups is a valuable means to identify populist discourse and to prevent conﬂating populism with empirically related concepts, e.g. radical right-wing ideology. To test the role of moralization in populist discourse, I propose a two-stage dictionary-approach, which allows to detect all references to the people and the elite and subsequently tests whether the two groups are framed in a moralizing manner. I evaluate my empirical strategy against other approaches using a text corpus of all speeches given in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014. Taking the moralizing notion of populism more seriously does not only contribute to our theoretical understanding of populist discourse and its impact on the political sphere, but also enables us to empirically distinguish populism and radical right ideology more clearly.

2019	84141	272	Measuring Populist Discourse: The Populist Discourse Dataset for Leaders	This research note introduces the Populist Discourse Dataset, which measures the level of populism in the discourse of 160 chief executives (Presidents and Prime Ministers) from 71 countries across all continents, covering 250 terms and more than 1,000 speeches. We describe the data and the data generation process, and move to give the broadest description to date of the level of populism by leaders of government in the world. We give a few examples of how the dataset can be applied, and use it to correlate the level of populism across countries with factors often considered as explanations for it, such as corruption and economic crises; and its theorized consequences, such as economic collapse, increased corruption, political participation, and erosion of basic democratic freedoms. Taken together, it presents a comprehensive picture of where populism is more (or less) salient today, as well as its main correlates.	Bruno Castanho Silva	NA
2019	84362	292	Measuring Populism with Expert Surveys: The Political Parties and Populism Expert Survey (POPPA)	While the study of populist parties has matured in terms of our theoretical understanding of populism, one area where supply-side populism research lags behind is reliable data collection. This is in part due to the fact that measurements of party-populism has not kept pace with the theoretical understanding of populism. With this contribution we introduce the Political Parties and Populism Expert Survey (POPPA) dataset. Fielded in the spring of 2018, the survey contains over 250 parties from over 30 European countries based on the assessments of over 300 experts. Experts were asked to judge all relevant parties in the these countries’ party systems on various dimensions of populism, on party organization, and on attaching ideological dimensions. With this paper we, first, examine whether it is possible to measure populism using expert surveys. To ensure external validity, we cross-validate the POPPA estimates with other supply-side measures of party positions and populism. To ensure internal validity and reliability, we examine expert coherence and agreement. Second, we explore the extent that this dataset can bring new insights into the study of supply-side populism.

2019	86367	964	A democratic deficit in world politics? Novel conceptualizations and global survey experiments	Is there a global democratic deficit? This is considered a “key” concern (Nye 2001:2) in our age of globalization. Yet, there is little systematic conceptualization and empirical investigation in this respect. My project aims to do both. Following Norris’s (2011) approach of defining democratic deficits from the perspective of citizens, I conceptualize the global democratic deficit in absolute terms, i.e. based on an ideal of democracy (cf. Norris 2011), and in relative terms, i.e. benchmarking against existing political systems (cf. Moravcsik 2004). In a representative pilot survey of British citizens via YouGov two principal findings emerge: First, my (re-)conceptualizations of the global democratic deficit appear to be valid. Second, from the perspective of UK citizens, there seems to be a global democratic deficit in absolute and relative terms, albeit – perhaps surprisingly – not a major one. In the next project phase, I conduct representative surveys in Argentina, China, India, Russia, Spain, and the United States to further confirm the validity of my concepts and to assess the degree of democratic deficiency in global governance as perceived by people worldwide.

2019	86157	808	The dynamics of policy congruence and satisfaction with democracy	Alongside other scholars, we have shown in previous research that proximity to a party in terms of ideological preferences (Brandenburg and Johns 2014) or policy priorities (Reher 2016) is positively associated with democratic satisfaction – even if that party is not in government. In Britain, both the polarisation of the early 1980s and the convergence of the New Labour era stretched the mean distance between voters and their nearest major party. Moreover, Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader constituted an “exogenous” shock to Labour’s ideological position. We analyse the consequences of these shifts by exploiting the rich 13-wave internet panel data collected as part of the British Election Study between 2014 and 2017. This simultaneously allows us to test the inherently dynamic nature of the core proposition for the first time, which usually remains implicit in previous cross-national research: do voters become more (less) satisfied with democracy as a party moves towards (away from) them? The findings suggest that government status rather than party affiliation conditions the role of ideological distance, challenging prior conclusions based on cross-sectional analysis.

2019	86217	854	Diffused Polarization: The Impact of Issue Diversity on Collective Will Formation and Satisfaction with Democracy	Does the impact of party system and electoral polarization on democratic outcomes depend on the range of issues voters care about? Recent debates on polarization have focused on the negative effect of polarized systems on a number of democratic outcomes. We argue that polarization has a negative effect on an important measure of the quality of democratic systems, satisfaction with democracy, at the individual level. However, we demonstrate that at high levels of issue diversity, defined as societal contestation taking place over a wide range of issues, the negative effect of polarization is minimized. Drawing on the deliberative democracy literature, we argue that at low levels of issue diversity, polarization makes compromise in society less likely and the political discourse more antagonistic. However, at higher levels of issue diversity, contestation and conflict can be diffused over a large range of issues, providing more favourable conditions for collective will formation and, ultimately, higher levels of satisfaction with democracy. We test our argument empirically combining observational data from the Eurobarometer with a survey experiment and evidence from online focus groups.	Sara B. Hobolt	NA
2019	77543	59	Process or Outcome? Popular Conceptualisations of Democracy in the Arab World	How do people in the Arab world conceive of democracy? Many studies have used survey data to explore the factors which lead individuals in the Arab world to support or reject democracy, but there has been little research into how survey respondents understand democracy. In this paper, I use data from Arab Barometer to investigate how Arabs interpret democracy and the influences on and effects of these conceptualisations. I find a significant divide between those who see democracy primarily as a process, involving elections, political equality and freedom to criticise the government, and those who view democracy mainly as an outcome, involving economic equality and provision of public welfare goods. Those with higher incomes, a greater level of education and who are more religious hold more process-oriented conceptualisations of democracy. More outcome-oriented conceptions of democracy are associated with greater support for democracy as a political system. These findings contribute to debates about the nature of public support for democracy in the Arab world, the compatibility between Islam and democracy and the difficulties of cross-national survey research on essentially-contested concepts.

2019	84685	347	Democracy strained: The effect of financial bailouts on political representation.	This paper analyses the effect of financial bailouts on individual perceptions about the way democracy works. A common understanding of democracy is that it serves as a mechanism to moderate conflict over preferences by periodically giving citizens a chance to vote on those preferences. Alternation in power is, thus, associated with a possible change of a policy paradigm. This paper argues that this idea may be challenged in hyper-globalised contexts that are exposed to severe economic crisis. In this context, a trade-off between levels of globalisation and levels of procedural democracy can be defined. I use the euro-crisis that started in 2009 to develop my theoretical framework and exploit the use of financial bailouts as Bayesian mechanisms that resulted in a fundamental change about the way democracy works within EMU countries. Using data from the Eurobarometers between 2001 and 2017, and using a diff-in-diff analysis, I show how levels of satisfaction with democracy, trust in national parties and trust in national governments experienced a significant decline in bailout countries compared to non-bailout countries in the period under study.

2019	86233	866	Formal models and empirical analysis of electoral rules. The case of Romanian parliamentary elections in 2008 and 2012.	We propose to analyze the formal properties and the real consequences of a special Romanian electoral rule, hereby denoted by ρ, used in two parliamentary general election (in 2008 and 2012), and eventually replaced by a simpler plurality one. This rule was a mixed one, a hybrid between plurality and proportional rule. We first produce a formal model of this rule and analyze its consequences. Particularly, we emphasize the puzzling behavior of the ρ rule, especially the violation of desirable properties like monotonicity and independence by appealing to both hypothetical, as well as to particular outcomes of 2008 and 2012 Romanian general elections. We develooed a model of logistic regression to predict the odds of obtaining mandates when this electoral rule was applied. We argue that the success of a candidate does not only depend on the number of votes s/he received, but also on the votes of the party's other candidates in the same constituency, the rank of the party's candidate in the constituency, as well as the interaction between the rank and the size of the district.

2019	86509	1079	Anocracy in Ankara: Co-party Bias in the Turkish Housing Development Administration (TOKI), 2002 - 2016	Core Vote and Swing Vote are two different hypotheses explaining the distribution of government resources. In this paper, we test the Core Vote (Cox and McCubbins) versus Swing Vote (Lindbeck and Weibull, Dixit and Londregan) hypotheses and develop our theory of which strategy a government would adopt as the country moves from democracy toward autocracy. We develop a model to show the relationship between changes in democracy and its impact on which voting block receives a higher distribution of public resources. Using the data of public housing between 2002 and 2016 and four general election results in Turkey, our OLS regression results show that our estimates of co-party bias using the public housing data follow the Polity IV trend closely: the less democratic Turkey becomes, the more co-party bias there is. We expand on this discovery through the use of fixed effects regression with instrumental variable estimation as our identification strategy. Our results illustrate that the change of the incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP)’s vote share will positively impact the quantity of public housing built in a province.

2019	85073	403	Should One Depend on the Partisan Vote or Gather Floating Votes? — Variation in Voting Behaviors on District Magnitude	In this paper, we argue that a difference in district magnitude, the number of seats per district, causes variation in voting behavior. We assume that a Multi-Member District (MMD) election creates more partisan (party)-oriented votes whereas A Single-Member District (SMD) election creates more personal (floating) votes. Using data from the Japanese Local Assembly Election, we showed how a candidate's smile, one of the most personal aspects, is effective in gathering floating votes under SMD while it does not increase the vote share under MMD.

2019	84960	390	Nobody likes to support a loser, do they? Examining the social-group bases of third-party voting in recent British elections	While single-member district plurality electoral systems create incentives for voters to avoid supporting a party that will place third or worse in their district, recent research suggests non-trivial shares of voters do. To help understand why so many voters support third-placed parties, this paper examines an argument rooted in social cleavage theory holding that voters belonging to social groups represented by a particular party will be more likely to vote for that party in districts where it places third than other groups - even if they recognise that “their” party is out of the running in their district. Using data from the 2005-2010 British Election Panel Study, the analysis shows that, even after controlling for several alternative explanations of third-placed voting behavior, voters belonging to groups affiliated with particular political parties are significantly more likely to vote for their party in districts where the party places third or worse than voters belonging to other social groups.

2019	86558	1124	The Impact of Electoral Systems on Party-centred Voting	In a nutshell, our argument is that left-right ideology is more important to explain voting behaviour in systems where leaders present a fixed list and voters can only cast a single vote for a party without disturbing the provided rank of candidates. In these systems, voters tend to become more party-centred there because votes for one candidate of a given party are pooled across the whole party. Moreover, following Carey and Shugart (1995), we argue that district magnitude moderates these effects. As district magnitude increases, the explanatory value of party-centred variables also rises when the electoral system does not foster personal vote-seeking, but it falls when the electoral rules foster personal vote-seeking. To test our expectations, we turn to the three first waves of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). This dataset selection helps us to maximize variation in electoral rules and, hence, allows us to leverage cross-system variation.	Pedro Riera	NA
2019	86173	822	The Economic Crisis News Cycle	We examine the dynamics of economic attitudes and the mediated economy over the course of the 2008 Great Recession in the UK. The UK media was quick to respond to the global shock with a large jump in the volume and negative tone of newspaper stories. But volume and negative tone persists in spite of improvements in economic output. At the outset of the economic crisis the public behaves similarly -- they register a particularly dramatic negative subjective evaluation of the economy. But subjective evaluations recover quickly as economic output improves. Over the course of the economic crisis economic attitudes more closely track the real economy than is the case of media economic coverage. The public disengages from economic news over the crisis cycle -- in the latter years they pay less attention to economic. news and media economic coverage is more weakly correlated with subjective economic evaluations.

2019	84406	303	I can’t be wrong since everyone I follow thinks like me: disentangling the relationship between cognitive styles, media preferences, and attitudinal polarization	Social media are frequently called into question for spreading fake and extreme news into bubbles of like-minded users. However, little is known about the cognitive profile of the voters that are willing to enter, and to remain, within an echo chamber for gathering political information. The goal of this paper is to shed new light on the determinants of media preferences, as well as on their consequences for public opinion formation. We investigate a set of hypotheses linking the individual cognitive mindset—specifically the need for cognition and for cognitive closure—to the variety of news sources that are accessed and, in turn, to the likelihood of attitude reinforcement or transformation. To this end, we design and administer a smartphone application to gather individual behavioural data on media consumption on a daily basis. Items tapping the voters’ cognitive profile, as well as a survey experiment assigning pro- or counter-attitudinal information, are also included to clarify the causal role of voters’ cognitive mindset, media consumption patterns, and changes in political attitudes.

2019	86409	997	US Congressional Candidates’ Twitter Campaign Strategies	This article examines US congressional candidates’ messaging strategies during the 2018 midterm campaign. Using every candidates’ tweets, in conjunction with an original dataset of 280 million tweets matching a dictionary of election related keywords in the fifty days leading up to the election, we uncover variation in how potential legislators publicly presented themselves and how the electorate responded. Using an affinity model approach of text analysis, we show how candidates’ electoral circumstances, partisanship, and descriptive traits dictated their messaging strategies, such as their willingness to discuss polarizing issues or comment on the partisan issue of the day. In doing so, we assess conventional claims about the importance of Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, health care, and immigration in Democrats’ and Republicans’ respective campaigns. Additionally, we compare these messaging approaches with the political conversations occurring simultaneously in the districts of candidates using geocoded tweets. Our results highlight the importance of electoral conditions in how campaign appeals are developed and their relationship with election returns.	Constanza Sanhueza Petrarca	NA
2019	86564	1128	Media bias, social networks, and correlation neglect	A newspaper tries to convince voters to support the government by sending a potentially informative message about the government’s quality. Voters first observe the newspaper’s message and an independent source of information and then take to a social network to deliberate. While doing so, they interpret the information provided by their peers as independent observations and hence neglect the underlying correlation. We derive the newspaper’s optimal editorial policy which defines the expected quality of its message. The newspaper’s optimal editorial policy is biased in favor of the government. Moreover, we uncover a social network effect: as social networks grow larger and voters become more and more connected, the newspaper’s bias increases and the information content of its message decreases. Elections may therefore aggregate information less reliably as social networks grow larger.	Philipp Denter	NA
2019	83845	243	Unemployment Experiences and Policy Preferences: Evidence from a Survey of Mayors	A growing literature has documented that the individual characteristics of political elites, such as their previous occupation, education or gender, affect the policies they implement in office. But why are background characteristics relevant? This paper argues that politicians from different socio-economic backgrounds have different personal experiences, specifically with unemployment, and that these experiences in turn shape their preferences for social policy. To study this question, we conducted a large survey to 900 Spanish mayors in Autumn 2018, as well as a survey to the general population. The surveys contained a priming experiment, where we randomly varied the order of questions about mayors’ unemployment experiences and their preferences towards social policies. We first show that exposure to unemployment (experienced personally or vicariously through family members and close friends) is much less frequent among mayors than in the general population. Next, we demonstrate that personal experiences have a causal role on shaping social policy preferences. Our paper contributes to the literature about political selection by highlighting a specific mechanism through which the personal background of elites affect their decisions on social policy.

2019	86220	856	Economic Shocks, Party Competition and Turnout	In this paper we investigate how the 2008 economic crisis has affected the relationship between economic inequality and political inequality. Drawing on recent literature by Pontusson and Rueda (2010) and Anderson and Beramendi (2012) we formulate a set of hypotheses to explain the relationship between economic inequality, party competition and turnout. Specifically, we expect that in countries in which political parties compete and mobilize low-income voters through programmatic competition along the economic dimension should be the ones in which electoral participation has increased the most, especially turnout among low-income voters and where economic inequality has risen. As such, we expect a less pronounced negative relationship between economic inequality and political inequality with more programmatic competition. We exploit an integrated file with CSES individual-level data on turnout. We estimate two-stages weighted regression models employing a difference-in-difference approach, before and after the economic crisis. The results show that the differences in income-turnout slopes between low-income and high-income voters have become less important in countries with more programmatic competition. This paper has important implications for our understanding of the determinants of political inequality.	Francesc Amat	NA
2019	86332	938	Retrospective Voting in Central And Eastern Europe: Hyper-Accountability, Corruption Or Social Inequality?	We investigate voting patterns in the Central Eastern European region since the beginning of transition using panel regressions. We find that the phenomenon of “hyper-accountability” identified by earlier scholarship is still prevalent in the region – incumbents on average lose substantially, and this phenomenon is even increasing with time. Secondly, economic conditions – specifically unemployment – exerts a powerful influence on incumbents’ re-election chances. Third, contrary to expectations expressed in earlier scholarship, the influence of unemployment does not strengthen over time, as its influence has weakened substantially in the last decade. Fourth, corruption also has an influence on re-election, although, interestingly, this effect manifests itself only within-countries (but not across countries): better scores in corruption in countries over time translate into higher share of votes (lower losses) for the incumbents. Fifth, inequality has no relationship with incumbents’ re-election chances. Sixth, we identify a rather robust interaction effect between unemployment and corruption. To be concrete, unemployment is an important factor in influencing election results in more corrupt countries, but not in “cleaner” ones. We discuss the implications of these findings.

2019	86223	859	Choosing Challengers: Economic Performance, the Cost of Ruling, and Retrospective Voting	How do voters decide? With respect to economic performance, research on retrospective voting provides a clear expectation: a poorly performing economy means that voters are less likely to support the incumbent. But if economic decline turns them away from the incumbent, where do the voters go? How do voters choose among challengers? To address this question, we advance a general theory of retrospective voting and apply it to the choice between three governing party types: sitting incumbents, established alternatives, and inexperienced alternatives. We argue that voters choose in two stages. The first stage is a referendum on the incumbent party, which they evaluate in terms of its record as manager of the economy. In the second stage voters choose among challengers based on policy alternatives. When the cost of ruling is high, voters are more likely to revert to an established party option, even in the face of economic decline. We test the argument with an analysis of individual data from 60 post-election surveys and an examination of vote shares from 223 elections in 18 advanced democracies	Timothy Hellwig	NA
2019	84779	361	Does EMU affect clarity of responsibility in domestic economic voting? An experimental analysis	This paper focuses on the Europeanisation of national electoral politics. It investigates whether, and under which conditions, the transfer of economic responsibilities to the EU level generated by EMU, and politicized by the Eurozone crisis, has affected economic voting. It addresses an apparent inconsistency in voting behaviour literature. On the one hand, in fact, there is some evidence that EMU and the politicization of the EU have made citizens more aware of supranational constraints, and consequently reduced economic voting. On the other, however, recent research has also shown that economic voting was stronger during the Great Recession than before. We use experimental data generated by the ERC MAPLE project in six EU countries (Belgium, Ireland, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Spain) in January 2019 to overcome the multiple endogeneity problems that lie in the analysis of the relations between responsibility attribution, economic perceptions and the vote. Our experimental design allows us to look at the (relative) weight of economic considerations on the vote calculus in different contexts of clarity of responsibility, and to explore the relevance of multiple moderator factors.

2019	81367	122	They are all the same: Populism and perception of mainstream parties	Research on populism often relies on the assumption that populist voters view the society as divided into two homogeneous and juxtaposed groups: the 'good' people and the 'evil' elites. This view is tantamount to a case of group categorization where political elites are the out-group and the people, as well as populist parties, are the in-group. However, although crucial, whether and to what extent this categorical thinking is reflected in the way citizens perceive political parties has not been tested. Building on literature on social categorization, we argue that populist voters perceive mainstream parties as more homogeneous than people who support traditional mainstream parties. We test this proposition using cross-sectional survey data from European democracies. We isolate partisan perceptual bias from populist supporter specific categorization and use expert assessments as additional baseline. Second, we zoom in using a multi-wave Italian representative panel to evaluate whether perceptual homogeneity is a consequence of populist support, or rather, populist party success is partly due to already existing perceptual homogeneity among the electorate.

2019	81522	134	Like Voters, Like Politicians: Descriptive Representation and the Rise of Polulist Parties in Europe	The recent rise of populist parties has shaken all European democracies. Data on politicians shows that populist candidates have an advantage in descriptive representation: populist politicians are more similar to their voters in terms of educational attainment, occupational profile and government experience. Could this explain their increasing popularity? Do voters prefer politicians who look like them for instrumental reasons or for psychological (makes you feel good about yourself) reasons? We implement a voting experiment in the Italian context to test i) if voters prefer candidates who “look like them”, and ii) if there are psychological reasons for this preference. We conduct an online experiment on a representative sample of voters and, following psychology work on self-affirmation, induce an increase in treated respondents’ self-integrity. Respondents are asked to rate a series of political candidates, both populist and traditional, with a feeling thermometer. This allows us to show whether support for populist parties is partly based on a psychological motivation. Intuitively, the boost to one’s self-integrity that can be obtained by voting for a similar candidate is already supplied by the treatment.	Emily West	NA
2019	86185	832	Voters of Populist Parties and Basic Human Values. Reflections on the Consequences of Demand-Side Populism in Europe.	The proliferation of populist parties has contributed to the pertinence of the academic debate on the consequences of populism. Overall, most of the scholars’ attention has been directed towards supply-side populism, examining under what circumstances populist parties can be a threat to democracy. However, populism is far from being an exclusively elite-driven political phenomenon, which also invites to reflect about the consequences of populist preferences among citizens. Whit this goal in mind, I will utilize data from the last European Social Survey (ESS 2016) to examine what is the structure of basic human values shared by voters of populist parties. Given that human values have been found to orient political attitudes and political behavior, I suggest that relevant insights can be extracted from this analysis. In particular, I expect that populist voters will differ from the rest of the population with regards benevolence, universalism, and self-direction, although this can be mediated by the host ideology to what populism attaches in the electoral competition. The implications of these differences in the structure of values will be examined in detail.	Hugo Marcos-Marne	NA
2019	86333	939	'Popular wisdom' or flimsy excuse? The impact of representation gaps on populist party success	Populist rhetoric everywhere depicts political representatives as corrupt and unresponsive. Is populist party success a reaction to real failures of ideological representation? Most studies explain populism via cultural-psychological and socio-economic predictors, focusing on individual-level (demand-side) explanations (Mudde, 2004, Inglehart and Norris, 2016, Rovira Kaltwasser et al., 2017). They appear to assume that the elite has indeed been unresponsive. Moreover, most studies use right-wing populist party support as the dependent variable, and results might be only relevant to this particular type of populism. This paper tests a supply-side explanation of populist success - elite ideological incongruence - and whether it mediates the impact of economic and cultural anxiety (both of the left and of the right). We test our hypothesis by employing modules 1-4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. We adopt Bayesian scaling to measure ideological congruence (sociotropic and egotropic) as well as a conjoint experiment to probe the causal mechanism. The paper weighs in on the debate over the potential ‘corrective influence’ of populism. It contributes to the literature on political representation, by investigating the consequences of representation gaps.	Miriam Sorace	NA
2019	86248	876	Puzzling populist surge? How populist attitudes and sense of crisis condition political participation.	Populist parties campaign successfully on the idea of “the people” linked to a shared group identity in times of crisis that must stand up against evil political elites to reclaim political sovereignty. Although undistorted implementation of people's will through more (direct) participation is a core demand in populist communication, empirical findings on the attitudes of populist citizens and the effects on their actual political engagement are mixed. Corresponding to social identity theory, a combination of strong in-group identification and an outside attack on the collective “us” actually promotes collective action. I argue that populist attitudes – creating a strong group identity through the antagonism of “the people” and the elites – only have a mobilizing effect, when they are combined with a perceived outside threat. Accordingly, this paper supplements populist attitudes with a new element (sense of crisis) and tests the relation with participation. Based on a representative survey conducted in Germany I show that only a combination of populist attitudes and sense of crisis leads to increased political engagement. Thus, this paper sheds light on the socio-psychological mechanisms behind populist mobilization.	Benjamin Schürmann	NA
2019	84968	391	Potential Electoral Support for the Radical Right in Ireland	In recent years, the rise of support for populist radical right (PRR) parties has transformed electoral politics in Western Europe. The Republic of Ireland is one of the few remaining West Europeans that does not (yet) have a successful PRR party, which raises the question of whether Irish history or culture makes it uniquely immune to the radical right or whether such a party could be successful. To examine this question, I field a unique survey experiment in which Irish respondents read about a hypothetical new party and subsequently assess their willingness to support that party. While the control condition describes a mainstream party, the treatment condition presents respondents with a hypothetical new radical right party. Analysis of the results indicate that there is substantial potential support for the radical right, particularly among those scoring high in authoritarianism, anti-immigration attitudes, and among younger respondents and supporters of independent candidates. These findings are consistent from those countries with PRR parties, suggesting that potential support for the radical right exists in Ireland as well.	Erik Tillman	NA
2019	85771	568	The Performance of Populist Right Parties in Open and Closed Lists. Evidence from a survey experiment	The 2015 European migrant crisis led to significant electoral gains of populist right parties in most recent elections in Europe, albeit to different extents. We analyse whether electoral system type mediates populist right party success. More specifically, we investigate whether open lists give centrist parties the opportunity to attract electoral votes by offering individual candidates with positions that are more extreme than the party mean. Transferring and extending arguments introduced by Blumenau et al. (2017) in the context of Brexit politics in the UK, we assess how ballot types (closed and open list PR) and information on candidates’ immigration-related positions affect individuals’ vote choice. We argue that individuals who vote for radical right parties under closed list PR may switch their vote to immigration-sceptic candidates of centrist parties under open-list PR. To test this expectation and examine its individual-level moderators, we rely on a survey embedded experiment with 6000 German voters.	Lukas Rudolph	NA
2019	86518	1087	Voter Preferences for Candidates with Different Social Backgrounds and Programmatic Commitments	Party systems in many advanced democracies have undergone three broad changes. First, social democratic parties have adapted their policy platforms and rhetoric to better reflect the preferences of the expanding middle class. Second, parties of all types have come to increasingly recruit their political personnel from the well-educated middle class. Third, populist radical right parties have emerged and established themselves in many advanced democracies. Although populist radical right parties draw support from all social classes, they are particularly successful among less educated and working-class citizens, who traditionally voted for social democratic parties. The goal of our study is to explore the extent to which changes in the policy platforms, rhetoric, and personnel of established parties have contributed to the realignment of less educated and working-class voters with populist radical right parties. We conduct a survey-based candidate choice experiment in Britain and the US to study this question. Respondents in the experiment are presented with profiles of parliamentary candidates that vary in terms of occupational background, positions on economic policy and immigrants’ access to social benefits, and framing of societal conflict.

2019	85783	575	Offensive or defensive coalitions? Coalition formation and voting systems in pre- and post-Arab Spring Morocco	How do electoral coalitions form under weak party systems? We compare the Moroccan municipal elections before and after Morocco’s failed revolution – the Arab Spring. We leverage a discontinuity in the electoral rule; namely, that municipalities below 35,000 inhabitants use majority rule, while municipalities above 35,000 inhabitants use proportional representation (PR) to show that electoral dynamics have not been altered by the Arab Spring. In both elections, PR depresses turnout, benefits smaller, historical, programmatic parties at the expense of clientelistic parties, because mobilizing voters under PR draws more heavily on party’s organizational capacity, held by historical parties. Yet, coalition formation dynamics have changed after the Arab Spring, shifting from coalitions opposing programmatic to clientelistic parties to coalitions that include both types. We argue that this change owes to heightened uncertainty about voters’ behavior in the post-Arab Spring context, leading parties to form coalitions designed to minimize potential losses in an uncertain context instead of coalitions that maximize gains in a context where voters’ behavior is well-known.

2019	86135	792	The electoral connection in parliamentary debates: how legislative speeches and direct communication to the public interact.	An ever-growing literature has focused on parliamentary debates as an important setting for parties and MPs to signal their policy positions to their constituents (Prosch and Slapin 2012; Back et al 2014; Martin and Vanberg 2008; Benoit and Herzog 2015). The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the electoral connection in parliamentary debates by focusing on the relationship between policy and non-policy factors. In fact, it has been long recognized that non-policy factors (including social identities, candidates’ personal traits, valence issues, etc.) play an important role in shaping the voters’ choices. We conjecture that populist parties might have an interest in stressing non-policy factors in their rhetorical strategy. To assess how policy and non-policy factors interact, we adopt a content analysis approach, comparing legislative speeches and tweets delivered by MPs directly to the public from their official Twitter accounts. We focus on legislative debates regarding the approval of the 2019 budget bill in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, since unveiling the economic policies represents a turning point for the populist parties currently governing in Italy.

2019	86368	965	Legislative Speeches and Domestic Conflict: The Case of the Philippines	How and why do legislators in semi-democracies discuss political violence in their national assemblies? We investigate the conditions under which legislative members are likely to make speeches on political violence. We develop hypotheses regarding legislators’ electoral interests, personal experience, party affiliation, and the types and significance of political violence. To test the hypotheses, we compile text data from legislative speeches in the House of Representatives of the Philippines for a period in which the country experienced much violent conflict (July 2013 – June 2017), and create a dataset of legislative members’ demographic and political characteristics. We analyze speech content using topic modeling. We also discuss technical issues in research on legislative records. The poor quality of text data extracted from PDFs requires a workflow that can be re-run without losing the results of ongoing manual cleaning. Using the Akoma Ntoso XML format allows us to maintain information about debate structure, but also raises the question of whether the individual speech is the most appropriate unit of analysis. Finally, legislators switch between languages mid-speech, posing challenges for natural language processing.	Jonathan Lewis, Naoko Matsumura, Kazuhiro Obayashi, Aya Watanabe	NA
2019	86184	831	Patterns of Legislative Speeches in the Parliament of Canada	This paper analyses the effect of parliamentary rule change on the dynamics of parliamentary speeches in the Canadian House of Commons between 1901 and 2015. During this period, several new rules—such as a time limit on speeches or closure—were introduced to reduce the opportunities for private members to speak during legislative debates, so that the government could get its business done in parliament within an acceptable amount of time. Our analysis looks at the impact of these rule changes on the content, the orientation, and the duration of Member speeches. These individual speeches are taken from the Hansard records and were collected in each parliament through the lipad.ca website. Our results show that parliamentary rule changes had an important effect on the content and the duration of legislative speeches. These findings confirm that institutional rules have over time limited democratic representation in the Canadian Parliament.	Jean-Francois Godbout	NA
2019	85237	425	Tracking personalization in British Maiden Speeches from 1945-2017	Several studies have pointed to important changes in the nature of political representation. Politics is thus increasingly described as ‘personalized’ in the sense that MPs see their representational task as more individualized (McAllister, 2007). This is a crucial development as it has important implications for party democracy. Still, we know little about if the behavior of politicians also have become more personalized (Rahat & Sheafer, 2007; Karvonen, 2010). The aim of this paper is to contribute to close this gap. The paper investigates British MPs’ maiden speeches from 1945-2017. The British case allows us to investigate personalization in a setting with strong parties and an electoral system that provides an incentive for MPs to personalize their behavior. Furthermore, maiden speeches provide an unique opportunity to track personalization over a long time span, in a speech where floor time is not restricted by the party and where factors such as seniority and leadership position is kept constant. To analysis the large corpus of speeches, this paper utilize quantitative text analysis and develops a general dictionary for analyzing political personalization.	Marie Kaldahl Nielsen	NA
2019	82560	172	Exploring Female Legislators’ Policy Agenda Using a Dynamic Topic Model	Drawing on almost a century of legislative debate, this paper explores the evolution of women’s speech in the Irish parliament. We examine changes over time in the substantive topics addressed by women MPs and also explore developments in their rates of participation. Using a rich dataset of MP demographic characteristics (including education, occupational background and age) and political characteristics (such as party affiliation, career length, leadership experience, constituency profile and seat marginality), we test whether there are independent gender differences in members’ speech patterns and emphasis. In particular, we examine the policy focus of female versus male MPs. To unveil these patterns MP speech content is analysed using a new dynamic topic model. This method is applied to the full corpus of legislative speeches from January 1919 to November 2017. Substantively, our findings suggest that women representatives’ agenda evolves over time and reacts to exogenous events such the rise of women’s movement and membership of the European Union and that, controlling for political and demographic characteristics, women’s policy focus is distinct from that of their male counterparts.

2019	85216	418	Can s/he do the job? A study showing how German representatives control male and female ministers	Despite increasing chances for women to rise to top positions of the executive, we know little about how male MPs react to this development and how they use parliamentary oversight mechanisms to control women who gain power. This paper steps into this gap by answering the following questions: Do representatives control female ministers more tightly than male ministers? And, how does the relationship vary by portfolio? We draw on unique data covering four decades of parliamentary activity in the German Bundestag to answer these questions. The ministry addressed by written parliamentary requests – the main tool of representatives to control the government in parliamentary democracies – constitutes our dependent variable. Our findings reveals that male representatives are particularly likely to direct questions to female ministries with portfolios that might be described as gender-neutral (e.g. environment) or masculine (e.g. economy). Men control womens's executive tasks more tightly when they govern in other policy areas than traditional women’s issues. This study is one of the firsts to connect research on legislative behaviour with gender stereotypes about women’s capacity to govern.	Corinna Kroeber, Sarah C. Dingler	NA
2019	86445	1027	Media and Gender Politics in East Asia: A Text Analysis of Newspaper Articles on Legislative Activities	East Asia’s three most developed democracies—South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan—have seen a two-threefold increase in their proportions of female legislators since 1990. Against this background, the paper examines how female legislators have been portrayed over time in the mainstream media. For this goal, 2,500 newspaper articles describing women-issue bills, e. g. maternity leave, equal employment, and sexual harassment, were randomly selected from five major newspapers published between 2000 and 2016. Using quantitative text analysis, the main analysis investigates male and female legislator differences in newspaper coverage, tone of related article, and stereotypical representation. Moreover, potential factors affecting the quantity and quality of female legislators’ newspaper portrayer, e. g. newspaper’s known ideological spectrum or age and gender of journalists, are tested using logistic and multi-nominal regressions. The paper contributes to the gender politics literature by clarifying an important context of substantive representation of women—the role played by media.	Jaemin Shim	NA
2019	85482	496	Gender in government: a comparative analysis of the effects of gender on ministerial stability.	Recent research has told us much about the role of gender in political career outcomes, including election to parliament and ministerial selection. What happens after ministerial selection – and thus the effect of gender on career outcomes at the highest levels of politics – has received less systematic attention. Ministerial stability is one metric of ministerial career success and existing findings on gender and ministerial stability are both mixed and limited in empirical scope. Using a data set on 4000 individual ministers in 35 parliamentary and semi-presidential systems since the 1980s, this paper examines the effects of gender on stability in government. It employs a party-centred competing risks approach and finds that women have had a substantially higher risk of individual exit from cabinet through resignation, dismissal, or losing eligibility for office than their male colleagues. It explores how the effects of gender vary depending on, first, the principals’ (prime ministers’ and party leaders’) attributes, including their political ideology, age, and their own gender and, second, the political context, including the gender composition of cabinet and of the pool of ministrables.

2019	85633	518	Women's representation in parliamentary parties: A comparative analysis	The aggregate number of female MPs worldwide is increasing. This number, however, is not equally distributed among parties. Why do some parties send more women to the parliament than others? Despite a huge body of research focusing on the factors that are significant in explaining national patterns in women’s descriptive representation in parliamentary institutions, studies on the effect of party-level characteristics on gendered political representation are still limited both theoretically and empirically. Building on Caul's seminal work (1999), this paper aims to fill in the gap in the literature on women's representation in a comparative perspective. By relying on an original dataset collecting data for parliamentary parties in 26 countries and 30 elections, this study examines how party-related variables, such as the candidate selection process, intra-party democracy, ideology and voluntary quotas, affect women's representation. Our dataset combines data from national parliaments and IDEAS datasets with data collected by the Comparative Candidate Survey project. This allows to incorporate party-level variables and country-specific characteristics, such as the electoral system and the existence of legislative gender quotas, in a multi-level fashion.

2019	85871	633	The Effects of Sibling Gender and Order on Political Aspirations	Women remain underrepresented in legislative bodies throughout the world. Using a rich dataset of the entire adult Danish population, including all political candidates from 1990 to 2013, we explore how gender composition and order of siblings affect probability of running for office. First, we investigate the importance of gender composition and gendered stereotyping. We expect that parents’ gendered upbringing affects political aspirations and that political aspirations are primarily considered to be masculine. Because gendered upbringing is stronger when parents have children of both sexes, we expect that first-born women should have a higher likelihood of running if their younger sibling is a woman rather than a man. Second, we investigate the importance of sibling order and gender. Being the oldest sibling provides children with leadership experience. We expect that this role as the older sibling has the strongest effect for women, counteracting the effects of gendered upbringing. Our study may help explain why women continue to be underrepresented in politics, and may highlight the importance of early life socialization and competences in political careers	Rasmus T. Pedersen, Jens Olav Dahlgaard	NA
2019	86104	770	Wasting Female Candidates? Examining Party and Gender Differences in Candidate Retention	While research on women’s political representation has substantially increased our understanding of what it takes to get elected, we know little of the faith of unsuccessful candidates. Yet, in the context where parties struggle with dropping membership numbers and limited supply of high-quality candidates, retention of existing - both electorally successful and unsuccessful - candidates is crucial. To address this gap, we propose a dynamic approach to investigate the probability of previously (un)successful male and female candidates to reappear on the ballot paper. Is past electoral performance rewarded or punished the same way for all candidates, or are there party- and gender-specific differences in candidate retention? We answer this question with a purpose-built longitudinal dataset covering the last four rounds of German general elections. We find evidence that each German Bundestag election brings to the electoral contest a large number of new candidates - both men and women – who have not contested the federal level legislative seat before. The data also show that candidates’ past electoral performance is not rewarded identically for men and woman in all parties.	Maarja Lühiste	NA
2019	86034	715	Multi-Level Governance and Women’s Legislative Representation	Research has shown that the type of electoral system, gender quotas, and a country’s general socio-economic development affect women’s political representation. Less attention has been paid to the effects of decentralization reforms on women’s electoral performance. Due to less costly and competitive electoral campaigns, women can have easier access to sub-national parliaments. At the same time, this impact might be mitigated by specific institutional constellations such as party systems and gender quotas. We argue that the effect of decentralization on women’s legislative representation is dependent on the political relevance of the sub-national units in the national political system measured by the RAI index. To test this, we use an original dataset on women’s legislative representation in 383 regional parliaments in 20 European countries from 1970 to 2018. Preliminary results show that despite the general increase in women’s representation over time, it remains lower in the more relevant sub-national parliaments. Thus, enhancing the attractiveness of these political positions to the mostly male political elite inhibits women’s electoral success in regional parliaments.	Kristina Gushchina	NA
2019	83752	238	Using Gender Quotas to Fight Intraparty Battles	This paper studies the role of gender quotas as a tool to consolidate power within political parties. I argue that party leaders can neutralize potential (male) challengers by strategically blocking their careers through the selective use of gender quotas in their constituencies. I explore this possibility in the context of the 2015 Mexican legislative election, in which a major party reserved a set of single-member districts for female politicians in order to comply with the legally-mandated national quota. Using an original dataset that combines information on reserved districts with results from the party's previous internal elections, I find evidence that the decision of what districts to reserve is indeed driven, to a large extent, by intraparty competition. Specifically, I find that the party leaders were more likely to reserve districts where the support for their faction in the party’s internal elections was lower. These findings have important implications for the literature on the adoption of party quotas, and provide a complementary answer to the puzzle of why predominantly male political elites promote the adoption of these policies.

2019	86296	911	Descriptive Representation and Price Discrimination	We argue that descriptive representation can have substantial effects on the lived experience of marginalized populations and test our argument with novel data on import tax rates for paired male and female targeted goods (products that are substantively equivalent, save their intended marketing toward male or female consumers). Descriptive analysis shows that cross-national patterns of price discrimination do not readily conform to expectations anchored in the broader treatment of women. The central analysis finds that increasing the share of parliamentary seats controlled by women significantly decreases the so-called 'pink tax,' the realized level of price discrimination in female-targeted consumer goods --- a direct benefit to descriptive representation.

2019	87206	1242	The Impact of Institutional Design on Women's Committee Appointments	An incumbency advantage, seniority rules, and even open discrimination have been identified as potential causes for the relegation of female legislators to the sidelines during the policy-making process. This paper expands this line of work by considering how variations in institutional design affect the appointment of women to powerful committees. In chambers where committees have substantial gatekeeping authority, a position in an influential committee is more valuable than instances where gatekeeping powers are limited. We hypothesize that when committees are afforded strong gatekeeping power, female legislators are less likely to be appointed to prestigious committees than their male counterparts. We systematically test our conditional hypothesis using a novel data set that combines a representative sample of elite surveys containing information on committee appointments, political experience, and political party for legislators in seven Latin American democracies. Importantly, in our analysis, the value of committee appointments varies not only across countries in terms of the committee system design and gatekeeping powers, but also within countries because not all committees are equally likely to impact the policy agenda.

2019	84315	281	Made to be broken: false promises in election manifestos	Research on election pledges typically assumes that parties seek to fulfil their promises, but face a number of constraints (including control over relevant government offices and the presence of institutional and political veto players) that limit their ability to do so. Yet the empirical findings suggest that many of these institutional and political factors actually have quite a modest effect on pledge fulfilment. This paper addresses this puzzle by questioning the assumption that election pledges reveal true party intentions. Political parties make some pledges that they genuinely intend to fulfil; while other promises are made to be broken. It is only by restricting the analysis to the former set of pledges that the true effects of institutional and political variables on pledge fulfilment can be measured. This argument is tested using new data on economic pledges in Ireland. In order to distinguish true promises from false promises, I examine the characteristics of the pledge, including its specificity and whether or not it has been costed by the Department of Finance.	Rory Costello	NA
2019	84340	287	Media Coverage of Campaign Promises Throughout the Electoral Cycle	A growing body of work shows that governments fulfil a majority of their promises outlined in party manifestos. However, only a minority of voters believes that politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to accurately recall the fulfilment or breaking of salient campaign pledges. I argue that this disparity between public perception and reality is partially driven by the information voters receive in the media. Based on a new text corpus of over 480,000 sentences on pledges published in 25 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, I find support for these expectations. The number of statements about broken promises is between 1.5 and 2 times larger than the number of statements about fulfilled promises, indicating a consistent negativity bias. Moreover, tabloid newspapers express much more negative sentiment in statements on promises when the endorsed party is not in government, whereas partisan broadsheet papers do not change their style of reporting. The results have important implications for studying negative information in mass media, and the linkage between voters and parties.	Stefan Müller	NA
2019	84645	336	How do voters define election pledges?	Election pledges are the central communicative act of representative democracy. They enable voters to select between parties and, hence, create a link between the preferences of the voters and the elected representatives. Extant research documents that parties between them make more than one hundred pledges in the typical election in western democracies, and that many of these – contrary to popular myth – are kept. Yet as of today, we have very limited knowledge about how voters use pledges to select between parties. One reason for this is that we do not even know what statements voters consider a pledge to begin with. How vague, conditional or unrealistic can political statements be and still be considered a pledge? Are pledges, in sum, a distinct type of communication to voters compared to, say, general statements of ideology and wishes for the future of society? To explore these issues, we employ a conjoint experiment. In the present version of the paper, we report the findings from two nationally representative surveys from Denmark and England.

2019	84812	365	How voters respond to party pledge fulfilment	Do voters respond to a government party’s pledge fulfilment? In this paper I draw upon a body of research on retrospective voting that has largely focussed on electoral accountability with respect to the economy. The theoretical framework presented in this study links government parties’ performances to their previous electoral pledges in various policy fields. I argue that pledge performance matters to voters because they care about the policies upon which parties have been elected into office, scrutinise whether these parties have stuck to their promises, and subsequently reward (punish) them at the following election for a good (bad) pledge performance. In this study, the hypothesis of “pledge performance based voting” is tested at the individual level, with CSES and National Election survey data in 12 countries and from 50 elections by drawing on logistic regressions. Additionally, moderating factors at the institutional, government and individual level are considered. The findings of this study improve our understanding of citizens’ retrospective voting considerations and have crucial implications for the democratic ideal of promissory representation.

2019	86254	879	Electoral consequences of coalition negotiation outcomes	How do coalition negotiation outcomes influence the electoral prospects of coalition parties? Political parties forming a coalition government join forces for the purpose of entering government, but they pursue different policy objectives and compete for offices. At the beginning of the legislative term, coalition parties therefore engage in intensive bargaining and negotiate the allocation of ministerial posts and the policy agenda for the upcoming term. We argue that these negotiation outcomes crucially affect the electoral prospects of coalition parties. More specifically, we hypothesize that the larger the policy and office concessions that coalition parties have made in coalition negotiations, the more they will suffer electorally. We test our theoretical argument on the basis of a newly compiled dataset on coalition agreements, opinion polls and electoral outcomes in 17 Western and Eastern European countries from 1971 until 2013. Our results have major implications for our understanding of the relationship between coalition negotiations, elections and political representation.	Heike Klüver	NA
2019	82290	161	Do voters update their perception of coalition parties’ issue positions? The influence of partisan motivated reasoning and political attention	This article investigates how voters infer the direction of policy change by coalition parties. Research posits that coalition parties try to maintain their public profile by communicating their policy differences to the public. Yet other work suggests that voters are not receptive to such party messages because they rely instead on a simple coalition heuristic to update their perceptions of parties’ policy positions. This article contributes to the debate by examining the influence of partisan motivated reasoning and attention to politics. I argue that voters increasingly emphasise policy differences between coalition parties the more attention they pay to politics. This tendency is particularly strong among voters who identify with a coalition party. Joining a coalition induces partisan motivated reasoning whereby supporters of a coalition party push the other coalition party further away from their own position (contrast bias) while pulling their own party closer to them (assimilation bias). An empirical analysis of the 2010 coalition between the British Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats provides support for my arguments. The findings have important implications for the study of coalition governance.	Philipp Dreyer	NA
2019	85285	438	Coalition cabinets, radical right parties and government policy: Why coalition governments go tough on immigration	Do radical right parties influence government policy in multiparty cabinets? Radical right parties have been increasingly successful across Europe. While the literature has focused on explaining electoral support for radical right parties, little is known about their consequences on government policy. We posit that radical right parties pose a major challenge to coalition parties even though they are typically not in government. They constitute a threat to government survival and are able to attract voters across traditional lines of conflict weakening coalition parties across the entire ideological spectrum. We thus hypothesize that coalition cabinets go tough on immigration if they are confronted with radical right parties and that this effect increases with the vote losses that coalition parties have suffered. Our theoretical argument is tested based on a newly compiled dataset that brings together data on coalition agreements and election results across 24 Western and Eastern European democracies from 1945 until 2015. Our results have major implications for our understanding of party competition, government policy-making and how radical right parties transform European democracies more generally.	Fabio Ellger	NA
2019	80771	108	Should we stay or should we go? Electoral effects of dropping out of coalition talks	Before coalition governments are established, political parties engage in coalition talks in which the coalition’s policy agenda and the distribution of ministerial offices are negotiated. It frequently happens that parties abandon coalition talks despite having spent weeks or even months in negotiations with potential parties, thereby significantly delaying government formation. Despite the central importance of timely government formation for the stability and performance of political systems, we hardly know anything about why parties abandon coalition talks, giving up attractive ministerial posts and risking public blaming. In this paper, we argue that parties abandon coalition negotiations as they expect to reap electoral gains. The positive electoral effect is, however, conditioned by the extent to which parties would have to make concessions to their partners and by party type. To test our theoretical expectations comparatively and over time, we have compiled a comprehensive dataset on the electoral performance of 202 political parties running in 196 elections in 27 European countries from 1974-2014. Our results have important implications for our understanding of party competition, coalition governments and the stability of democratic systems.	Heike Kluever, Jae-Jae Spoon	NA
2019	82552	171	A Model of Ideology in Authoritarian Regimes	This paper develops a theory to study ideology formation in an authoritarian regime. Contrary to the previous studies which focus on the effect of propaganda on ideology formation in an authoritarian regime, this paper looks at the role of policy experimentation in shaping ideology. In this framework, an autocrat who cares about political survival chooses policy experimentation which in turn affects the structure of economy. Citizens choose level of effort in the economy. Ideology is defined as citizens' believe of how the economy should work. Citizens form ideology based on their experiences in the economy. If citizens' ideology diverges far enough from the regime's ideology, they withdraw their support for the regime. This framework is used to explain the evolution of ideology in today's China.

2019	82588	177	Class or Economic Voting? Evidence from Social Mobility in Victorian England	We examine class-based versus economic voting by evaluating the effects of social mobility on voting behavior in the 19th-century England. We use unique individual-level administrative records preceding secret ballot that contain information on which candidate(s) each voter voted for and the voters’ occupations. While we do not find strong evidence of a cleavage along the working and middle class divide, we find evidence of a union of the landed gentry, farm workers, non-skilled workers and white-collar workers voting on average more for the Conservatives, and petty bourgeoisie and skilled workers for the Liberals in a cross-section. The changes in voting behavior within individuals due to social mobility are immediate and mainly consistent with the same cleavage. One interpretation is that voting was influenced by economic incentives related to the interests of the new and old industries, but voting was to less extent determined by class background.

2019	85773	570	Politician Quality, Ideology and Fiscal Policy	This paper studies the role of politician quality in policy-making. I use administrative registry data on local politicians in Finland to examine the markers of politician quality that are typically employed in empirical research. Exploiting exogenous variation generated by close electoral races that shift the quality composition of local councils, I show that high-income, re-elected incumbent and competent politicians (i.e., politicians with high residuals from a Mincer income regression) improve fiscal sustainability outcomes without cutting public goods and services provision. Symmetrically, university-educated local councilors manage to increase public spending without affecting fiscal sustainability. I use unique survey data on candidates’ policy positions to show that politician quality is also associated with economic ideology. These correlations are in line with the policy effects that I find. Thus, good representatives on both sides of the political spectrum improve policies.	Jaakko Meriläinen	NA
2019	86554	1120	Ideology and Donations to the UN System	Why, despite persistent complaints from member states about bureaucratic bloat and operational inefficiency, has the United Nations failed to reform in any meaningful way? I argue that this is driven by member states cultivating ties with particular UN agencies through ideologically-driven donations to these agencies, which leads the agencies to be responsive to the donors' preferences. Consequently, states ultimately prefer the inefficiencies than risking issues being handled by agencies to which they have weaker ties. I investigate this claim empirically by showing that countries' ideological orientations influence their donation behavior in the UN. Not only do countries that are ideologically close to the US contribute more, their donation preferences differ even among agencies that are thematically similar. The results extend our understanding of states' informal influence on IOs, and highlight that continued inefficiency in the operation of UN agencies may be a pernicious problem to solve.

2019	86588	1150	Digital Style and Political Realism	The internet is not just about information, friends and entertainment. There are more subtle things going on. Subconsciously, web browsing opens up a world of styles and impressions. To some of those styles we are used to, but often it is just unfamiliar language, new images and experiences. How does it matter that we read text, information, entertainment written in style (and language) that is not our own ? The current debate both in academia and the real world about the negative effects of the internet on political polarization are well known. The arguments circle around overt features of communication, social networks and outright misinformation. What is often overlooked though is the impressionistic richness of out online lives. This experiment/ project tests predictions on the effect of style on 1) biased reasoning and 2) political fragmentation. Our conjecture is the idea that unfamiliar style makes us actually more realistic about power and the need for compromise. We provide evidence that diverse style, as opposed to diverse content can enhance subconscious contrasting and political realism.	soenke ehret	NA
2019	82164	151	Strategic uncertainty and group bias	Many of our decisions are made under strategic uncertainty and involve an assessment of how much risk others are willing to take. Research on social identity suggests that it is likely that when individuals encounter somebody who shares a group identity with them, they make inferences about that person's attitudes that typically assume greater similarity to their own attitudes. Little is known, however, about whether similar attributions take place with respect to risk attitudes and whether such attributions reduce strategic uncertainty in in-group interactions. This study induces group identities and then places individuals in a standard decision situation featuring strategic uncertainty. We find that behavior is identity-match contingent and group size dependent. Variation in experience with the identity group pre-game influences subjects' choices in the strategic interaction. We interpret both of these findings as evidence for a difference in strategic uncertainty in interactions with others who share one's identity vs interactions with those who do not. Our results call for a re-assessment of current explanations of identity-contingent behavior in strategic games.	Dominik Duell	NA
2019	84064	265	The Democrat Disaster: Natural Hazard Exposure, Risk Aversion and Insurance Demand	How does a change in risk aversion translate into political support? Using a quasi-experimental design that exploits temporal and geographical variation in exposure to hurricanes in the United States, I find that as proximity to and intensity of disasters increases, individuals become more risk loving. I argue this is because individuals trade off private and public insurance as severity of exposure changes. I collect and harness rich data from multiple sources, including novel data on US hurricane trajectory, longitudinal precinct results and insurance-related internet searches. Studying within-state behaviour, I find that being closer to a hurricane path increases the individual's intensity of inquiry for private insurance. Because of these changes, public insurance demand decreases and Republicans experience a significant electoral gain following natural disasters. These effects are particularly important as US elections follow closely after the hurricane season.	RALUCA PAHONTU	NA
2019	84912	380	Does platforming extremists fuel extremist views?	Do mainstream media platforms help to legitimise extremist views? Our study tests the hypothesis that mainstream media coverage confers legitimacy to right-wing extremist views via a survey experiment (N=3000) fielded in Australia. Employing a 2x2 factorial design, the experiment uses a recent audio recording from a mainstream Australian TV network’s interview with a far-right activist to test if exposing subjects to the audio legitimizes the activist’s views. The first experimental arm varies whether subjects are exposed to the audio of the interview or to a weather report, and the second arm varies whether we announce (or not) the name of the network which broadcast the interview/forecast. We expect to find a positive effect of the audio on support for race-based immigration policies, and social dominance orientation, which should be magnified if the TV network is revealed. The experiment contributes to understanding the media’s role in legitimizing extremist views.	Diane Bolet	NA
2019	84450	315	Political Repercussions of Open Borders	Prominent explanations of anti-immigrant attitudes give centrality to the socio-cultural differences between immigrants and host communities and to the economic threats posed by newcomers. In this paper, we provide evidence of a backlash to immigration in a context where both socio-cultural and economic threats were minimal. We study Switzerland, which opened its borders and labor market to the rest of Europe in the 2000s. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we first show that the number of Germans living in Swiss municipalities on the German border increased dramatically after the borders opened, while the number immigrants from other European countries was unaffected. In the same border municipalities, we find that support for the anti-immigrant Swiss People’s Party rose by approximately five percentage points after borders were opened. In additional analyses, we explore the effects of opening borders on economic outcomes, on preferences for social spending, and on attitudes revealed in survey responses. Together, these findings contribute to our theoretical understanding of anti-immigrant sentiment and have important implications for the political consequences of the European Union’s principle of free movement.

2019	86155	806	Public finances and fiscal windfalls: A quasi-experimental study on fiscal behaviors	We study the impact of a one-time exogenous fiscal windfall on local public finances in the canton of Zurich (Switzerland). The fiscal windfall was due to the flotation of Glencore on the London Stock Exchanged, which caused an extraordinary local income tax revenue paid by a resident of the municipality of Rüschlikon (about 160 million CHF). Most of the municipal tax payment entered the resource equalization scheme and rained down on the municipalities of the canton inducing a temporary windfall (1 million CHF on average). Based on this quasi-natural experiment we investigate how this one-time fiscal windfall affected municipal budgetary decisions. Using detailed accounting data at the municipal level, we are able to estimate the causal effect of the windfall on all accounting positions. Our results show that the windfall caused large budgetary shifts and considerable expenditures increases and revenue decreases beyond the windfall.	Simon Berset	NA
2019	81778	143	The Early Warning System and Voting Behavior in the Council of the EU	Does the Early Warning System (EWS), as the name suggests, indeed warrant caution to the European Commission about the prospects of EU policy-making? The literature so far has been critical about the EWS, referring to it as a harmless procedure with only marginal impact. In this article we address the aforementioned question by uniquely matching Reasoned Opinions (ROs) issued by national parliaments under the EWS with their governments’ votes and formal policy statements in EU Council negotiations. Based on a novel dataset that includes more than 400 matched legislative proposals (9,636 country-vote observations) we find empirical evidence for a strong and positive relation between ROs and negative votes. Moreover, Commission proposals that received ROs have a significantly higher probability to be ultimately withdrawn altogether, even in the absence of a yellow card. Our results run counter to the dominant view in the literature that the EWS has a marginal impact on EU decision-making. Instead, it constitutes a clear signal that negotiations are likely to fail.

2019	82927	191	Co-issuance of Reasoned Opinions under the Early Warning System	The Early Warning System (EWS) allows national Parliaments in the EU to issue Reasoned Opinions (ROs) against proposed new legislation. The goal of this system is for Parliaments to police the subsidiarity principle. If one third of Parliaments issue an RO, a yellow card is triggered and the Commission has to reconsider its proposal. This article identifies the dimensions of conflict in the EWS using dyadic regressions on the co-issuance of ROs by Parliaments. It finds that closely aligned levels of economic development, rather than geographical or ideological proximity, are most strongly associated with the co-issuance of ROs. In addition, increasing co-issuance over time suggests that more yellow cards may be issued in the future.	Martijn Huysmans	NA
2019	84337	286	Turf Wars in Government Administration: Interdepartmental Coordination in the European Commission	One challenge for government administration is to reap the benefits of specialization while minimizing its negative side effects. Inter-departmental coordination is one possible solution to that challenge. Which factors motivate departments to engage in coordination? To what extent are they motivated by concern for administrative turf? On the theoretical side, this article presents a model of turf war in government administrations. It derives testable hypotheses that discriminate between two motivations for coordination, namely “efficiency concerns” and “turf war.” On the empirical side, we test those hypotheses by studying all policy proposals adopted by the European Commission between 2015 and 2017—a total of approx. 5,000 cases. To this end, we present a new data set which is based on CIS-net, the Commission's internal coordination platform. We find that departments are more likely to enter into coordination if they expect competing departments to become active, too. The size of this effect increases in the political salience of proposals. Overall, our findings indicate that interdepartmental coordination in the European Commission is significantly motivated by concern for administrative turf.	Daniel Finke	NA
2019	78612	77	Does European Integration Increase Sub-National Power? Evidence from a Times-Series Cross-Sectional Analysis	The literature on the relationship between EU integration and regional power has produced two opposing theoretical models. Depending on the model, EU integration leads to either an increase or decrease in regional power. Evidence for both, however, has been limited to qualitative case studies, with inconclusive results. This paper, on the other hand, offers a quantitative, large-N analysis, using data from fifty-six countries between 1960 and 2010. Concretely, it relies on a random effects model to show that EU membership considerably increases regional authority within member states, and it includes tests for two possible mechanisms.

2019	86437	1020	Strategic Rapporteur Selection in Informal Inter-Institutional EU Negotitions	In informal interinstitutional decision making in the European Union, delegations from the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union meet behind closed doors to reach a compromise that is subsequently rubber stamped by the parent chambers. The literature on informal decision-making points to the risk of policy drift towards key figures. Both chambers should select the key negotiators strategically if the potential for agency drift exists. I test whether the Parliament selects its key negotiator, the rapporteur, strategically using new data on individual preferences of all members of Parliament, national and European party affiliations as well as committee memberships within Parliament. To identify the effect of informal negotiations on rapporteur selection, I exploit a rule change in 1999, where file conclusion using informal first reading agreements became possible for the first time. I estimate local average treatment effects using a regression discontinuity approach and provide evidence for strategic selection. The Parliament selects more centrist agents overall and more moderate party group members. Five-hundred placebo tests over a twenty-years period illustrate the robustness of the findings.

2019	86576	1140	The antidumping procedure as an outlet for protectionism in European Union trade policy	In this paper we present a game-theoretical model of the antidumping procedure in the European Union (EU). We identify the key players and study the member states’ and institutions’ optimal strategies. Moreover, we analyze why the EU uses a special procedure to impose antidumping duties, rather than the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) that applies to most legislation, including other trade policy issues. Our model concludes that the use of a special procedure allows the EU to pursue more protectionist antidumping policies than it could under the OLP, if the European Parliament (EP) is less protectionist than the pivotal member states. We use Bayesian item response models to compare the positions of the EP and the pivotal member states on trade issues between 2009 and 2018, and find that the EP is indeed less protectionist. We further focus on specific antidumping cases to illustrate the rationale for using a special procedure. Our analysis shows that the antidumping procedure can provide an outlet for the concerns of protectionist member states in an environment otherwise characterized by trade liberalization.

2019	86370	967	Populist United: A Theory of Intra-Party Bargaining under Policy Constraints	We develop a model of multi-party electoral competition, where policy platforms consist of traditional spatial positions and a policy in favor or against economic/political integration (globalization) that imposes binding policy constraint on the traditional left-right dimension. Parties consist of two factions, the Opportunists (office-seekers) and the Militants (ideologues), and we extend John Roemer's Party Unanimity Nash Equilibrium (PUNE) concept for endogenously formed parties to derive a manifold of equilibria, ranging from moderate pro-membership, to populist, to polarized anti-membership ones. We apply the Nash bargaining solution, by allowing for the possibility of party splits as disagreement outcomes, to refine our predictions and infer under which conditions party splits are more likely. We show how populism can arise in equilibrium as an outcome of intra-party bargaining that keeps the party together in the face of strong factionalism over supranational integration. Our model predicts that party fragmentation and polarization are more likely when the orthogonal benefits of integration are lower and policy constraints are tighter. We test the empirical implications of our model using data on party splits from the ParlGov dataset.	Konstantinos Matakos	NA
2019	83054	201	Comparing EU member states’ human and administrative resources with their bargaining satisfaction in the Council	This study intends to contribute to the literature on the power of EU member states by focusing on the effects of states’ human and administrative resources on bargaining processes in the Council of the EU. These resources refer in particular to the human capital and administrative capacities that member states can mobilise in the context of EU negotiations to advance their political preferences.This research intends to compare the bargaining satisfaction of member states in fifteen recently adopted legislative files (2015-2018) with the quality of their internal coordination processes, the resources of their permanent representation and the individual capacities of their negotiators. In order to measure the bargaining satisfaction of member states, this research draws extensively on the methodology previously developed as part of the DEU dataset by Thomson (2011). This methodology provides with a unique way to compare, via in-depth interviews with decision-makers, the initial preferences of member states with negotiations’ outcomes.Datasets on states’ resources and bargaining satisfaction were collected via 98 semi-structured interviews conducted in Brussels in 2018 with national negotiators from all member states.

2019	85314	451	The politics of State aid in the European Union: explaining variation in aid allocation among Member States	Despite widespread acknowledgement of the dangers of selective subsidisation, government support to business remains common practice. However, the reasons why governments choose to do so are still under-explored. Scholarship so far has failed to address this issue in a comprehensive manner, focusing either on the responsiveness of governments to societal demands, or on the use of subsidies as an electioneering tool. Drawing on the literature on distributive politics and political economics, the paper adapts Persson and Tabellini’s model of democratic policy-making to join these two perspectives. Looking at State aid allocation in 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) between 1992 and 2011, the paper asks why some countries grant more State aid than others. The model tests how aid allocation depends on the attainment of policy goals (namely correction of market failures), electoral pragmatism and the responsibility towards international commitments. The implications are relevant for the management of State aid control in Europe, as well as for the more general understanding of the so-called interventionist state in Western democracies.

2019	82857	186	Bargaining Outcomes and Success in Fiscal Governance Reforms (1997-2013)	We assess the accuracy of procedural and bargaining models in predicting outcomes of fiscal government reforms of the European Union between 1997 and 2013. These negotiations were characterized by a high cost of no agreement. Although we confirm the accuracy of the compromise model, a procedural model with a costly reference point performs equally well. The difficulty in estimating the cost of no agreement is therefore a likely reason for the commonly reported result of poorer performance of procedural models. The paper also assesses the determinants of bargaining success and the robustness of standard measures of model accuracy to mis-categorization of governmental positions.	Fabio Franchino	NA
2019	85806	588	The Public Legitimacy of the European Union	As a political system with limited coercion capacity, the EU's ability to govern effectively strongly relies on its legitimacy to take political decisions with citizens. However, we know relatively little about the factors that influence citizens’ perceptions of the EU's “right-to-rule”. This is surprising given the central role legitimacy plays in the scholarly debate on the EU’s alleged democratic deficit. We set out to investigate the public legitimacy of EU decisions. Specifically, we explore how procedural aspects of the decision-making process, public opinion on the subject in the EU and in the member states, as well as the congruence of a decision with personal preferences affects perceptions of legitimacy. We do so with a vignette experiment that alters the properties of a fictional political decision made by the EU. The experiment was fielded in Germany, France, Italy, Poland and Spain. Our results provide valuable insights into ways in which the EU might improve its legitimacy with the public as well as advance our understanding of the determinants of legitimacy beliefs in federalist political systems.

2019	86555	1121	Elites' attitudes on European integration and solidarity	In the aftermath of the Eurozone and the refugee crises the EU witnessed a growing tension between the social and economic dimensions of integration. Against this background, we investigate national political elites' preferences on four social conflicts over the integration process: on preferences for the main mission of the EU; on cross-national solidarity; on solidarity vis-à-vis outsiders; and on the ultimate locus of political power. First, we aim to provide a map of political elites' views on each of the four dimensions. Secondly, we aim to assess which factors contribute to explain MPs positions testing hypotheses at the individual, party, and country level. We employ original data from an elite survey conducted in seven EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) by the REScEU project. It includes items designated to tap elites’ attitudes and preferences over different aspects of the concept of pan-EU solidarity. We believe that this paper provides a relevant contribution to the limited literature on political elites' preferences on EU integration and solidarity in times of increasing salience of the EU.

2019	86058	733	Loved and feared: Citizens' attitudinal ambivalence towards free movement in the European Union	Public opinion towards free movement is characterised by a paradox: On the one hand, European citizens perceive the border-free Europe as the most important achievement of European integration; on the other hand, the mobility of EU citizens has become a main driver for euroscepticism in many European countries. How can we explain these contradicting observations? In this article, I argue that free movement creates an attitudinal trade-off for citizens between their own citizenship-rights and the citizenship rights of perceived 'others'. To assess the ambivalence of citizens' attitudes towards free movement and to test the postulated hypothesis, I use cross-country observational data and a survey experiment in 28 EU countries. The empirical findings suggest that public attitudes toward a border-free Europe are systematically ambivalent due to a tension between the value of the own mobility rights and the fear of immigration from other EU countries.

2019	84659	341	One Union, different futures? Cross-national variation in public preferences for the EU’s future and their explanations.	Studies on public opinion towards the European Union (EU) largely focus on attitudes regarding the past and present of the EU, while overlooking citizens’ preferences for the EU’s future. This study aims to fill this lacuna by examining attitudes towards the EU’s future in different EU member states. We use a novel approach by first developing eight concrete future EU scenarios that represent different variants of ‘more’ or ‘less’ Europe. Subsequently we ask survey respondents to rank their top three scenarios. In a first analytical step, we examine the structure of these preferences using multidimensional unfolding analysis. Second, we use multinomial logistic regression to examine the socio-demographic and attitudinal explanations of these future preferences. We employ original survey data collected in December 2018 in five EU countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Spain, The Netherlands). The diversity of countries allows us to assess cross-national differences in the distribution of future EU preferences, as well as in the underlying motivations for citizens to prefer different variants of ‘more’ or ‘less’ Europe in the future.

2019	85030	401	Beyond policy positions and power: An analysis of the procedural impact of trilogue negotiations on the quality of EU legislation	The author analyses how the negotiation process in a specific decision-making arena in the EU, trilogues, shapes the legislative output of the Union. Trilogues have become the central arena of EU legislative politics. Despite their central role, empirical knowledge about the proceedings in trilogues is scarce due to their seclusion from public scrutiny. Applying a rigorous process tracing analysis, this paper contributes to closing this gap. On the basis of an innovative analytical division between the content and the process of legislative negotiations, a fine-grained theoretical model of causal mechanisms is developed. This model is tested in an empirical analysis of the negotiations on two legislative files. The analysis rests on a rich data pool of 20+ interviews with participants of the negotiations as well as public and non-public documents. The author finds that the shape of the negotiation process indeed has repercussions on the quality of legislation due to three factors: The nature of coalitions, the degree of informal coordination and the character of delegation. Further, he can explain how the institutional environment of trilogues fosters these effects.	Alexander Hoppe	NA
2019	84885	375	Legal Instrument Choice in the European Union	Regulations and directives are the central legal instruments used by the European Union. While regulations apply directly in all member states and often address policy problems with a great level of detail, directives tend to be more general in nature, but require transposition and thereby introduce some discretion for the member states. As the Commission is usually not required to choose a given legal instrument, it is quite surprising that we know little to nothing about the factors that influence these decisions. In this paper, we propose and test in particular two hypotheses: First, we expect that the choice of a regulation becomes more likely over time once the general matters of the policy area have been addressed via directives (H1). Second, we expect the Commission to resort to directives under conditions of high preference heterogeneity in the Council as the directives grant the preference outliers more leeway at the implementation stage than regulations (H2). We test these hypotheses using an original dataset of all directives and regulations proposed by the Commission between the year 1998 and 2018.	Yves Steinebach	NA
2019	86105	771	When parties collide: The impact of intra-EP dynamics on the on delegation choice in the EU.	Extant studies highlight increasing role of the European Parliament in selecting the agency for implementation stage of the EU decision-making process. Unlike most studies focused on the delegation dynamic, we propose to move beyond the ‘unitary actor’ approach to the role of the EP and examine the influence of intra-EP dynamics on the delegation choice in the Union. We maintain that the delegation dynamic in the EU is shaped by the extent of policy salience and polarization in the EP. Reflecting differences between political elites, increasing party polarization on a given policy motivates the EP to curtail a prospect of bureaucratic drift in case of delegation to the national administrations, and therefore enhances parliamentary motivation to empower the European Commission acting as a neutral broker. Policy salience further exacerbates the need of the EP to insulate policy implementation from the national influences to ensure a relatively uniform policy outcome across the member-states. To test these conjunctions we rely on the data from the Euromanifesto project as well on the dataset on agency discretion and delegation dynamic in the EU.	Sebastian Popa	NA
2019	83797	242	Institutional Evolution in the EU: The emerging balance of powers	Unlike many new democracies whose institutions have been carefully crafted with an eye towards a democratic inter-institutional balance and efficient decision-making processes, the European Union evolved in fits and starts over a half century, without any clear template or structural model. Instead, the history of the EU has very much been a history of ad hoc institutional adaptation, with institutions altered in response to changing demands and needs and reflecting the interests of the various actors involved at the time. Nowhere has this process of instrumental adaptation been more apparent than in the shifting roles of the Council of the European Union and its executive and legislative interlocutors, the European Council and European Parliament. This research examines the shifting power dynamics between these three institutions from the creation of the European Economic Community through the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty through the lens of historical institutionalism, with a particular focus on the critical junctures surrounding the inception of summitry and the birth of the European Council and the empowerment of the European Parliament following the introduction of direct elections.

2019	86560	1125	Politicized Senior Staffing and Work Attitudes: Evidence from European Countries	The employees’ attitudes toward work are strong determinants for the effectiveness and performance in organizations. The literature on the politicization of bureaucracy argues that politicized senor staffing is negatively associated with bureaucratic capacity and performance in an organizational level (e.g. Krause, Lewis, & Douglas, 2006; Lewis 2010), but it has not examined the mechanism at work. This paper investigates how politicized senior staffing will affect senior officials’ work attitudes including job satisfaction and organizational commitment in different echelons by using the COCOPS Executive Survey on Public Sector Reform in Europe (Hammerschmid, 2015). Specifically, the paper tries to identify systematic differences in positions of senior management. The preliminary result shows that those in lower positions of senior management are more likely to be affected by functional politicization (Christensen, Klemmensen, & Opstrup, 2014), rather than by political appointments. Additionally, I hypothesize that the effects of politicization on work attitudes may be contingent on public-like structure of bureaucracy. The strength of the association varies depending on how senior officials expect about their life-long tenure (Dahlström & Lapuente, 2017).	Hyunjung Kim	NA
2019	86451	1031	Regulating Supranational Lobbying through Voluntary Transparency Clubs: a Gold-Member perspective.	Regulating private actors’ participation in policymaking is key to democratic governance. Across political systems, targeted transparency is used to regulate lobbying. We examine the extent to which primary regulatory targets (organizations with frequent access to decision-makers) support the architecture of lobbying regulation regimes set up as voluntary transparency clubs. Our empirical testing ground is the European Union. We conceptualize the EU Transparency Register as a Voluntary Transparency Club, elaborate on its club goods, and derive a set of theoretical expectations about members’ evaluations of the club’s transparency standards, membership size, and monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We test our argument on an original dataset providing information about 632 organisations. We find significant differences between members and non-members’ assessment of the club’s regulatory performance. Members with frequent access to high-level decision-makers criticize the club’s transparency standards and its regulatory effectiveness. Yet, they support expanding its regulatory remit and increasing club membership. No significant differences mark their support for stricter monitoring/enforcement mechanisms. We contribute to the literature on supranational regulatory governance and on the design of informal EU institutions.	Adriana Bunea	NA
2019	86072	743	Defining and Measuring Policy Complexity: Evidence from EU Rules	European Union scholars often assume that the complexity of rules and laws correlates with response variables such as delegation, lobbying, and transposition delay. Obviously, measuring the complexity of public policy is challenging, which is why many researchers fall back on narrow proxies. I develop a concise and measurable definition of policy complexity with the help of humans' ability to understand text. Specifically, I ask crowd-workers to encode complexity by conducting pairwise comparisons of policies - simply indicating which text is more complex. To create suitable micro-tasks, crowd-workers do not read the entire texts of EU policies but individual articles and summaries of legislation provided by the EUR-Lex database. Next, a random utility model produces posterior estimates for the policies’ positions on the complexity scale as well as the workers’ reliability. The final output is a score for each individual article/case on a continuous metric. This complexity score is brought together with additional information about the text of the rule (e.g. rarity of words) to understand why humans consider certain policies more complicated than others.

2019	86489	1061	Interest group policy position-taking: A tale of dimensional salience and party policy?	Some politically active interest groups have clearly articulated policy positions on one or more policy dimensions while other politically active groups do not. While group related characteristics are likely to explain parts of such variation in interest group position-taking, this paper hypothesizes that party policy and the salience of the respective policy dimension also matter. By utilizing novel data from the 'Party-Interest Group Relationships in Contemporary Democracies' (PAIRDEM) project on interest group positions in six different European countries as well as the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), this paper investigates how interest group position-taking is affected by party positions and salience across six policy dimensions. The analysis shows that an interest group is more likely to have an articulated position when the policy dimension is salient in the particular country and the parties are divided on the policy dimension in question. This means that agenda setting dynamics also influence interest group position-taking.	Vibeke Wøien Hansen	NA
2019	86507	1078	A Tale of Asymmetry? Explaining Coalitions between Political Parties and Interest Groups	Just as parties build coalitions as a response to electoral conditions and interest group coalitions form to maximize political leverage, parties and interest groups may choose to establish organizational ties and collaborate. Yet, surprisingly little is known about why some take the strategic decision to form enduring ‘coalitions’ whereas others engage in less regularized or no interaction. Acknowledging that ideological proximity stimulates the formation of strong party-interest group ties, we apply a resource exchange model to account for variation. We hypothesize that whilst the mutual provision of tangible resources (like votes, donations or access to government) is needed to effectively explain whether parties and groups choose to establish (formal) coalitions, the distribution favors parties due their relatively superior position as gatekeeper to public office. Using data from a novel organizational survey of parties and interest groups conducted simultaneously in multiple Western democracies (the PAIRDEM-project) we test these hypotheses, but also examine how institutional factors (like state party finance and competition from other parties/groups) may influence the demand for and value of specific resources.

2019	85589	509	Why Do Women Speak Less? Disentangling Gender Differences in European Parliament Speechmaking	Research on parliamentary speechmaking and debate participation has consistently shown that women speak less than men, especially on policy issues considered 'hard' or 'masculine'. Little is known, however, about the mechanism behind this finding; in other words: why do women take the floor less often? Social role theory suggests that women self-select into speaking on certain issues in accordance with gender stereotypes. On the other hand, research has found that women are often assigned to 'soft' policy areas, indicating that party leaders act as potential gatekeepers to the floor. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of speechmaking in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2018, we seek to gain a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting differences in the allocation of speaking time between modes of debate to disentangle the mechanisms that drive floor participation. The results will show how and under what conditions supply- and demand-side mechanisms affect women's and men's participation in debates in the European Parliament. Our findings have implications for the connection between descriptive and substantive representation of women at the European level and beyond.	Verena Kunz	NA
2019	86420	1007	Out of the dark: voting behaviour in roll-call votes in European Parliament committees	Seventy-five per cent of EU legislation under the Ordinary Legislative Procedure is currently adopted in first-reading agreements between the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of Ministers. In the EP, the informalisation linked with such early agreements has empowered committees and their members to the detriment of the full plenary and transparency. Responding to these developments, the EP decided to introduce obligatory roll-call votes for final votes at committee level, providing novel insights into how MEPs vote away from the limelight of the plenary. This paper analyses MEP voting behaviour based on a new dataset comprising all committee-level roll-call votes during the 2014-2019 legislative term. Drawing on the literatures on early agreements and broader legislative as well as comparative politics, it derives and tests hypotheses on what behaviour to expect at committee level. The findings help us better understand the implications of decision-making at the committee level of the EP.	Lukas Obholzer	NA
2019	85637	520	What is in the 'bag'? Parliamentary questions of MEPs as a Proxy of Constituency Focus: Effect of Electoral Institutions and Career Ambitions	Written parliamentary questions (PQs) is the only activity of the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), in which they are almost free from the control of their two principals, national parties and the European Political Groups. It is therefore a valid proxy of their preferences and orientations, including the level of responsiveness to the national constituencies.Using the “bag of words” model to depict the presence of constituency focus in the solo-written PQs of MEPs served in the 7th European Parliament (EP), I show that electoral institutions for the European and national elections shape MEPs’ constituency orientations. Moreover, MEPs elected in the party-centered electoral systems are more constituency-oriented in their questions. That implies that MEPs take their future careers in the EP seriously, while creation of reputations among the party leaders mediate MEPs responsiveness to their respective constituencies. The argument also stands for the MEPs who want to move their careers to the national level, as party-centerdness of ballot for the national elections has also a positive significant effect on the level of MEPs' constituency focus.

2019	85820	598	Personalized legislative behaviour? The case of the European Union	Despite rising scholarly attention in political communication and electoral studies, we know rather little about the so-called personalization of politics with respect to the behaviour of politicians. This paper asks to what extent there is evidence for this phenomenon in the legislative behaviour of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and puts forward several hypotheses regarding moderating variables at the individual level (career), the party (mainstream vs. challenger party) and the electoral system. These are tested on a dataset that comprises all parliamentary questions (PQs) asked by MEPs between 1999 and 2017 (N=141,271). The preliminary findings suggest that the ratio of PQs that are asked only by one individual MEP does not increase over time relative to PQs that are supported by several MEPs. This would imply that legislative behaviour does not become more personalized over time. However, there are more MEPs asking more PQs over time, especially MEPs representing citizens from crisis ridden countries such as Greece and Ireland. Initial results further suggest that individual-level variables and party affiliations are more important than electoral systems for explaining personalization trends.	Katjana Gattermann	NA
2019	85553	504	Committee Bias, Policy Complexity and Legislative Efficiency	Parliamentary committees assume a central role in policy formulation around the world. While we know that committee membership is often biased, we know little about whether this bias also matters for the political process. Focusing on the European Parliament, this paper investigates if and how committee bias influences the legislative efficiency of the institution, measured as the time spent between the beginning and the end of committee deliberations on a given policy proposal. Specifically, we examine whether biased committees are more or less efficient in dealing with policy proposals of varying complexity. We hypothesize that efficiency losses are not solely related to committee bias, but accumulate disproportionately depending on the complexity of the underlying policy proposal. Employing a set of relevant controls, our analysis includes all ordinary legislative procedures started in the post-Lisbon period since 1st December 2009. We expect our findings to clarify the conditions under which committee bias has an actual impact for political processes and how the complexity of policy content influences this relationship. This has significant ramifications for our understanding of decision-making in parliaments.	Steffen Hurka, Constantin Kaplaner, Maximilian Haag	NA
2019	77224	51	Gender, Debate and Rebellion in the House of Commons, 1992 - 2015: A Structural Topic Modelling Approach	The number of women in the British House of Commons has increased substantially over the last quarter century. But how has the increasing number of women MPs shaped politics in Britain? We address this question by examining women MPs' participation in parliamentary debate using transcripts from more than 400,000 speeches made in the House of Commons between 1992 and 2015. In addition to examining whether women participate at a similar rate to their male colleagues, we examine whether their participation is associated with particular debate topics using a structural topic model. We find that certain debate topics in parliament are gendered. However, the prevalence of these topics does not seem to vary over time with the number of women in parliament. Moreover, we find that women are underrepresented in parliamentary debates, controlling for party and seat share, often even on debates associated with women's topics. If women MPs' participation shapes policy and impacts political representation, their underrepresentation in debate may have significant normative implications for democracy.	Jonathan Slapin	NA
2019	84721	357	Establishment Responses to Populist Challenges: Evidence from Legislative Speech	In recent years, many political systems have witnessed the rise of right-wing populist parties, sometimes challenging foundational norms of the established political system. In the face of such challenges, establishment actors face an important choice: whether to employ a strategy of disparagement, i.e. seeking to portray the challenger as democratically illegitimate, or engaging with it on par with other parties. Existing research into this choice examines only party system- or party-level variation. This paper revisits an oft-studied case in the literature, responses in the Danish party system to the entry of the right-wing populist Danish People's Party. I take a text as data approach, applying machine learning methods to around 16,000 paragraphs of legislative speech to measure responses at the level of individual speeches. Using this novel approach, which allows for a uniquely granular characterization of responses to right-wing populist parties, I uncover systematic individual-level, within-party variation, unexamined in the existing literature. The results suggest an important role for individual-level factors in explaining establishment responses to populist challenges.	Frederi Hjorth	NA
2019	84057	264	Minority Governments and Legislative Debate	Minority governments are a common feature in parliamentary democracy. While there is considerable evidence for their relative stability (in terms of duration and turnover) and efficiency, minority government might also be normatively desirable from a deliberation and quality of democracy standpoint: As governments need to actively seek approval of their proposals in parliament, opposition parties have the opportunity to shape policy outcomes through the parliamentary process. This could lead to more interaction between parties and bargaining in parliament as parties have to debate in a constructive way to reach a compromise. We compare legislative speeches of minority and majority governments to investigate the conditions under which patterns of legislators’ involvement and debate style change under either form of government. We analyse full transcripts of speeches in several parliamentary democracies, covering several decades and different types of cabinets. Answering how legislative debates unfold under minority and majority government has important implications for the quality of democracy and the analysis of parliamentary politics.

2019	86288	903	Sticks in a Bundle are Unbreakable? The Effect of Polarization on Parties’ Compromise Rhetoric in 7 European Democracies, 1995 - 2013	Current Western democracies are plagued by trends of increasing polarization and electoral fragmentation. Combined, stable government formation has become more difficult and protracted, as the last formations in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden demonstrate. Polarization seems to intensify political elites’ reluctance to compromise. We investigate when (changes in) polarization influenced parties’ compromise rhetoric. Utilizing parliamentary speeches for Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom between 1995 and 2013, we develop an innovative measure of parties’ compromise rhetoric employing and validating the Lasswell Value Dictionary on Cooperation. Combining our measure with existing data on institutions and ideology, we demonstrate that on average parties’ compromise rhetoric has decreased. Our results show that how polarization influences parties’ compromise rhetoric varies over institutional settings. For countries with a majoritarian government tradition, the more polarization leads to lower levels of willingness to compromise. For countries with a coalition government tradition, mainstream parties’ willingness to compromise was hardly affected by polarization due to mutual dependence. Thereby, the results of our study contribute to debates on legislative politics, party competition and polarization.	Anthea Alberto	NA
2019	86503	1075	Asking About Europe: MP's Use of Parliamentary Questions for European Issues	Why do national members of parliament use questions to ministers to ask about European issues, rather than just local or national ones? Questions are one of the most individual, flexible, and public ways that MPs can try to influence what their governments. As such, they allow us to look below the level of parliaments and parties to try to understand why individual MPs choose to focus on Europe. Using original web-scraped data on questions and interviews with MPs, I find that Eurosceptic MPs, opposition MPs, and those focused on more Europeanized policy areas are more likely to ask about Europe. In countries with higher levels of public Euroscepticism, pro-EU MPs are even less likely to ask about Europe, while Eurosceptic ones are more likely to do so. However, when there are short-term spikes in Euroscepticism, all MPs become more likely to ask about Europe. I also find that questions are used as a substitute for other tools or options for attempting to influence their governments' positions on Europe.	Lauren Perez	NA

Despite its status as the world’s most powerful court, recent scholarship has identified substantial self-restraint when the Court receives signals from member states. To date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered court behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on the effect of external strategic considerations on allocation of influence within the Court. Contrary to many other international courts, influence in the CJEU is individualized and distributed at the discretion of its leadership. This paper argues that the president seeks to enhance the Court’s position by strategic use of experienced members and emphasis of individual independence. Yet, case allocations remain sensitive to the broader (political) context. To support its arguments, the paper draws on original data including allocations in 6263 preliminary reference cases brought before the CJEU (1958-2015). The results speak to the key role of internal organization for judicial independence as well as the interdependence between state-signatories and the court’s leadership.

2019	85857	621	Three (main) roads to integration. Explaining the case selection for judicial review at the Court of Justice of the European Union	Scholars widely agree that the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) may exploit policy conflict in the EU legislature in order to make pro-integrationist judgments. Taking a step back, however, we do not know which kinds of cases end up before the court in the first place. I examine the three main judicial procedures – annulments, infringement proceedings and preliminary references – and develop a strategic account for under which procedure laws might be reviewed. Analyzing 160,000 legal acts, from the early days of the European Coal and Steel Community until 2018, I find that policy conflict in the legislature affects the probability that legal acts will be subject to an annulment request or an infringement proceeding. For preliminary references, I find that policy conflict is an important factor when judges decide whether to hear a case or not. My findings imply that policy conflict may hinder rather than help the CJEU, as case selection sets important scope conditions for judicial activism to materialize. They also provide novel insights for the debate on whether unelected judicial actors can drive European integration.	David Hilpert	NA
2019	86547	1114	Uncertainty and Legal Disintegration: Evidence from Brexit	The Brexit referendum has created uncertainty over the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU and, in so doing, over the application of EU law and the authority of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK legal system. While the UK is still formally part of the EU, we argue that this uncertainty is already discouraging British litigants and judges to invoke EU law and to refer cases to the ECJ. Using data on referral activity from the UK's accession in 1973 up to mid-2018, we apply a difference-in-difference design to evaluate the effect of the Brexit vote on the referral propensity of British courts. We find strong evidence that the Brexit vote is adversely affecting the use of EU law. UK judges are referring 22 per cent fewer references after the vote than did prior to it. With the future relationship between the EU and the UK still in limbo, our analysis suggests that the uncertainty arising from the political process has already begun to unravel the fabric of legal integration.

2019	85845	611	The EU in Crisis: Public Opinion, Disintegration Pressures, and the Future of European Integration (Roundtable Proposal)	The European Union is facing turbulent times. The cumulative effect of economic and political shocks in the last decade has been to sharpen the EU’s legitimacy crisis and to contribute to a rising wave of populism across Europe. Many Europeans have come to see the Union as being run by distant and unaccountable political elites who negotiate esoteric deals behind closed doors. Large parts of the public have come to doubt the competence and integrity of their political and financial masters in Brussels and at home. Eurosceptic sentiment is on the rise. It is no longer a phenomenon tied to small segments of society, extremist political parties or specific economic cycles. Today, leaders in Brussels and Europe’s capitals are confronted with a new and challenging political reality: the unprecedented development of European governance has led to greater public contestation, yet at the same time the EU is more reliant on public support for its continued legitimacy than ever before. How should the EU move forward? The participants of this roundtable will discuss this important question from different angles.	Christina Schneider, Catherine de Vries, Sara Hobolt, Julia Gray	NA
2019	86475	1050	Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in Poland – 15 years of RIA experience in the post-transition governance framework	RIA – originally grown within the US ‘regulatory state’ – was promoted by organizations like OECD as part of the ‘better regulation’ agenda. Poland – ex-communist, civil-law parliamentary democracy adopted it in 2001. The scope of RIA is limited to the proposals of primary legislation developed by the Cabinet and submitted to the Parliament. Proposed research paper attempt to evaluate (i) quality of Polish RIAs and (ii) their impact in the law-making process. To do so, extended ‘scorecard’ methodology (originally proposed by Hahn et al. 2000) was used to analyze ca 1900 RIAs developed over 2007- 2017 period. Secondly, internal consultations (between ministries) of 1457 cabinet proposals were examined to uncover the RIA role. Results support theories linking RIA with the Prime Minister’s political control of bureaucracy (principal/agent problem) and Minister of Finance specific relations with other ministries (fiscal discipline). Outside of this realm, evidence of perfunctory usage (Dunlop et al., 2012) was found. Analyzed period encompasses substantial reform of the RIA process as well as a fundamental change in policy formulation process – associated with gradual ‘illiberalization’ after 2015 elections.

2019	85213	417	Acceptability before and Acceptance after Experiencing Disruptive Technologies: The Case of a Self-Driving Bus Service Trial in Switzerland	The uptake of disruptive technologies such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) impacts society and existing governance alike. Through vehicle automation, positive impacts (e.g. on road-safety) can be expected. However, these predicted effects can only arise if AVs are accepted by society, as public acceptance is a necessary condition to successfully implement policies allowing a transition towards automated road traffic. Attitudes towards disruptive technologies have been found to be a precursor in citizens’ acceptance formation process. In other contexts, acceptance increases when individuals experienced successful (policy) implementation. Thus, higher support can be expected after implementation as preliminary anxieties show to be arbitrary and individuals get familiar with the new technology. The paper at hand examines citizens’ attitudes towards AVs explaining the acceptance of policies aiming at vehicle automation and how this changes pre- and post-implementation of a self-driving bus service. To assess these questions with a difference-in-difference approach, I use a representative sample of approximately 900 Swiss residents from a three-wave panel survey conducted between 2018 and 2019 in one municipality experiencing such a trial and two municipalities serving as control groups.

2019	81178	117	The chilling effects of aggressive policing practices: How Stop and Frisk affected undocumented students' performance	The New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk program has stopped and briefly detained millions of New York residents during the last decade, aiming to reduce crimes. It has been widely criticized for being inefficient and discriminatory, as few arrests are made and racial and ethnic minorities are stopped more often than whites. This paper examines if the program affects the life of unauthorized immigrants, who are likely to be particularly wary of interacting with the police. We combine data on police stops around university campuses with individual-level administrative data on student's performance and documentation status. The results show that undocumented students' study performance, relative to students with legal status, is adversely affected by the number of stops around campus. The results illustrate that stop-and-frisk and related police tactics have unintended spill-over effects on the behavior of unauthorized immigrants.	Niklas Harder	NA
2019	86172	821	Health awareness and the transition towards clean cooking fuels: Evidence from Rajasthan, India	Cooking with solid biomass causes high emissions of toxic smoke, evoking serious adverse impacts on human health. The Indian government currently promotes the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a clean alternative with a scale program covering the upfront costs of the new technology for the household. However, even after adopting LPG, a major fraction of the rural population continues to rely on solid biomass as the primary cooking fuel. One reason for the limited use of LPG could be that the health effects of solid biomass used for cooking are not sufficiently known to the households. We examine this hypothesis through an experiment providing randomized health information to 550 beneficiaries of the program in rural India. Our results indicate that health information significantly increases the willingness to pay for the next LPG cylinder and has a strongly positive impact on consumption behavior. At the same time, financial constraints remain an important barrier to regular LPG consumption. Our finding has clear policy implications as it suggests that LPG subsidy provision should be increased but limited to low-income families.	Martina Zahno	NA
2019	83179	213	Preferences For Flexibility and Social Contracts	John Rawls’ Original Position (1958) famously demands bargainers to abstract from arbitrary contingencies in choosing the basic structure of their cooperative venture. Contractarian orthodox rational choice theorists, such as David Gauthier (1986) and Michael Moehler (2018), object that instrumental reasons to abstract from arbitrary contingencies obtain insofar as bargainers internalise Rawls’ intuitions about fairness. In a pluralistic world, they maintain, we should not take this for granted. In this paper, I attempt to show that contractarian orthodox rational choice theorists need not be sceptical about abstraction. In fact, rational agents have instrumental reasons to abstract from some arbitrary contingencies (i.e. their current set of preferences and goals) when facing long-ranging, wide-ranging and one-way choices, regardless of their intuitions concerning fairness. Reasons to abstract stem from one’s uncertainty about future aims and aspirations, and invite agents to choose arrangements that provide them with flexibility. Following Kreps (1979), I attempt to show that preferences for flexibility capture agents’ interest of maintaining their power to shape their lives in due course.	Carlo Ludovico Cordasco	NA
2019	82731	180	The Constitutional Point of View	Despite methodological similarities, James Buchanan and John Rawls come to different conclusions about the constitution of a free society. Critically, Rawls rejects public choice analysis of the democratic process on the grounds that it underestimates the capacity of political actors to deliberate about a common good, the practice of public reason. Rawls’ belief that public choice assumes selfish political actors reflects an ambiguity in Buchanan’s work between thick and thin conceptions of homo economicus. This paper reconciles public reason with the public choice framework by introducing the concept of the constitutional point of view, as distinct from the moral point of view. The moral point of view is that of the ‘impartial spectator’ judging the appropriateness of agent behaviour from a neutral standpoint. The constitutional point of view is the way an impartial spectator judges the rulesthat guide agent behaviour. This perspective is constitutive both of public choice and public reason.	Nick Cowen	NA
2019	85492	500	Contracting with(out) Children: The Limits of the Social Contract	The social contract tradition has had a hard time incorporating children. By this I mean not only that the tradition has often ignored the special status of children within political communities, but that one dominant strand of this tradition has excluded children from membership in their countries of birth. In this paper, I trace the history of this model of children’s political status (which I call “the apolitical child”) to the writings of John Locke. This conception explicitly challenged the traditional vision of children as citizens of their respective political communities. Although it served to weaken the authority of absolutist monarchs over subjects born within their territories, Locke’s bold claim that children are not in fact citizens of any regime has limited the horizons of social contract theorizing, particularly with respect to education policy. In showing the radical nature of Locke’s move and its limitations, I aim to clear the way for a richer involvement with education by liberal social contract theorists.	Alexandra Oprea	NA
2019	78004	67	A Simple Model of the Difference Principle	In this paper, we present a socioeconomic model illustrating the difference principle first proposed by John Rawls (1971). We demonstrate that we can fulfil the principle by incorporating reciprocity into the basic structure of society and showing its appropriate embodiment in external increasing returns in line with the tradition of neoclassical economic theory, which is the exact mechanism described by Rawls (1971, 2001). Our model yields an intuition and an interpretation of the principle by showing its implementation in the market equilibrium. Moreover, it will show that the utilitarian principle which orders to maximize the total (average) utility stipulates the allocation where advantaged people monopolize all of wealth as just state of society. We also discuss the social and political conditions necessary for the difference principle to be stable and sustained.	Takashi Suzuki	NA
2019	76570	44	Hannah Arendt and Modernity: Revisting the work 'The Human Condition'	This article argues that Hannah Arendt’s major work ‘The Human Condition’ has some limitations when applied in the context of societies which cannot fall back upon the history of either ancient Greek Polis or Roman res publica. The entire political philosophy developed by Arendt in that text relies particularly on ancient western history. Added to the spatial dimension is the factor of time when considered with the conditions prevailing in the twenty-first century. The work’s major limitation is that ever since the text was written, the public sphere in the West and in the developing world has undergone a phenomenal expansion. . Thanks to the development of digital technologies and various media fora, such as the social media. In this context this paper revisits the text ‘The Human Condition’ both from the perspective of a developing country, such as India; and secondly from the stand point of the twenty-first century and attempts to offer a critical appreciation of the work.

2019	86077	747	Private Information and the Public Need to Know	Data-mining contributes to modern and better government. A deliberative and effective democracy is conditional upon accurate factual claims that often have their origin in the private sphere. Privacy describes the condition of being in control over access to information about oneself, data-mining undermines this. This triggers a debate about what we should be allowed to keep to ourselves and what the public has a right or need to know. How much privacy should an individual enjoy in a democratic state? There is a conceptual difference between different kinds of private information. While the way you dress is usually not of collective concern, the income that needs to be taxed is. Also, there is a difference between sharing information with your neighbor or with the state only. In this paper, I am arguing for a semi-private sphere where we need to give up elements of privacy for the effectiveness of the state and keep some of it to shape our interpersonal relationships. I intend to demarcate this semi-private sphere by looking at the public function of privately generated information.	Arno Stirnimann	NA
2019	86599	1158	The (Post-)Political Agency of the Digital Tech: Google in Focus	Having entered a new millennium, we, paradoxically, witness sustained hopes in the rise of ICTs, online networking and digital commons, and, at the same time, face the ‘hollowing of democracy’ (Mair, 2013). On the one hand, theorizing e-government, e-participation, etc. rarely treats the nature of democratic agency as contested, targeting the disruptive, emancipatory potential of digital innovation instead. On the other hand, intellectual debates on the crisis of representative democracy and advent of the ‘post-political’ criticize techno-managerial governance but hardly delve deeper into issues of the autonomy and power of rising global digital intermediators. I argue that this is a crucial issue for the political theory in the digital age and ask: how can we conceptualize the (post-)political agency of Google? Since that is an emerging debate with no authoritative answer yet, I, firstly, focus on the idea of a ‘technical code’ in the critical theory of technology (Feenberg, 2002; Beira, Feenberg, 2018), and, secondly, apply it as a theoretical lens to sort out, discuss and compare answers on the issue in the most prominent analytical work across disciplines.

2019	84903	377	Political theory of migration: new subject areas	During several decades Political theory of migration is developing mostly in frame of liberal approach. International institutions like IOM set global agenda basing on libertarian interpretation of migration processes – on human rights, citizenship and ethical problems of moral asymmetry between immigration and emigration. Their adversaries’ arguments deal with the right of self-determination, cultural security, preservation of welfare state and democracy which is bedding on domestic social justice. Broadly speaking it is an opposition between methodological individualism and communitarism. The essence of discussion concentrates on rights/ duties of incoming/receiving societies and moral/monetary price for exclusion and national sovereignty in globalist era. The theory of migration was mostly focused on normative and ethical issues and not very much related with the issues of political cultures, political regimes, political institutions.Thus we need the normative theory of migration which would be about political issues. For that reason we’ll try to develop the argumentation about the mutual impact of migration and three megatrends of world politics: globalization, democratization and integration not forgetting that they all now are on decline.

2019	85630	517	Random Assemblies as Guardians of Democracy	The rise of extremist political movements has fuelled the search for new mechanisms to safeguard democratic institutions. Existing mechanisms are often decried as either too legalistic (courts) or too political (parliaments). Moreover, these methods are accused of being dominated by political or technocratic elites. In addition, courts lack democratic legitimation, while parliaments pose the risk of tyranny of the majority against unpopular and vulnerable minorities. These considerations suggest the need for protective mechanisms that enjoy strong popular legitimacy, but without repeating the failings of existing democratic institutions. We suggest that randomly-selected assemblies might effectively serve as citizen tribunals enforcing anti-extremist measures. Random assemblies respect democratic equality through their selection procedures, thereby providing a strong form of democratic legitimation. They also provide descriptive representation, ensuring the politics of presence with respect to vulnerable minorities. In addition, properly-designed random assemblies can ensure impartiality; they are no bound to follow a partisan agenda and resist capture by political elites. We compare anti-extremist random assemblies with the practice of ostracism in Athenian democracy, and explore such assemblies might operate within the European Union today.	Peter Stone	NA
2019	86831	1221	Political Extremism and Legal Revolution	Extremism exposes a dilemma at the heart of constitutional democracy: what are committed liberal democrats to do when a majority threatens to abrogate those liberal democratic constitutional commitments using the constitutional amendment procedure? It reveals that democracy and liberalism are not the same thing – and they can oppose one another. In such cases, a decision is required: which set of constitutional commitments takes priority, liberalism or democracy? Is the source of legitimacy the guarantee of the right of the people to freely determine its interests — no matter what the content of those interests happens to be? Or is it checks on governmental power (even that of a majority), which take the form of guaranteed individual civil liberties and a system of checks and balances among institutions? I defend the latter. It leads liberal democrats to the constitutional form called constrained democracy. Constrained democracy conceives of democratic legal procedures as a superstructure resting on a foundational constitutional commitment to liberal values like individual liberty. I conclude by discussing two mechanisms of constrained democracy and their legitimacy: eternity clauses and party bans.	Benjamin Schupmann	NA
2019	81828	144	Political privilege and democratic theory	Critics of actual representative politics point to deficiencies in terms of the political presence and representation of disadvantaged groups who face bias, such as women, ethnic and racial minorities. What remains under-explored, however, is the flip side of disadvantage: privilege. Political privilege can be seen as the status enjoyed by social actors whose preferences and voices are given priority in the political process, often prior to, and outside the competitive electoral process. How they achieve this status is a question that brings back three pathologies of the political process: corruption, clientelism, and campaign financing as lobbying. With this paper, I am building an 'exchange model of politics' to understand privilege, recasting Dahl's pluralist model of democracy and Bueno de Mesquita’s ‘selectorate theory’. I claim that bias and privilege generate three tiers of democratic citizenship: the disadvantaged ‘subdemos’, the enfranchised ‘citizenry’ and the privileged ‘preselectorate’. The paper conceptualises the notion of political privilege and theorises its implications for democratic representation and public policy, with reference to the literatures on substantive representation, corruption, clientelism, campaign financing and lobbying.

2019	85914	658	Discursive representation: a compelling opportunity for local democracy	Discontent with political representation is deepening. Yet, there has been notable lack of political attention to the limitations of current models of democratic representation. While there are innovations in terms of national deliberative assemblies, descriptive representation of women and quotas, the key question of how voice is represented is neglected. In this paper, I argue in favour of discursive deliberation as a necessary institutional innovation in the context of intractable policy issues, populist politics, and the exponential rate of technological development. The case presented in this paper focuses on discursive representation at a local level in Dublin, Ireland. It reports on an investigation of discourses on the expansion of Dublin Airport as part of a public consultation in preparation of the Airport Local Area Plan. The paper presents the findings, the impact of the discourses on the Draft Plan, as well as on the representative process. The paper concludes with implications for discursive deliberative at the local democracy level and an outline of further research questions on bridging discursive representation and randomly selected assemblies.

2019	82411	165	Reconsidering the Instrumental Case for Epistocracy	Epistocratic political arrangements that apportion formal political power by competence have recently been proposed as viable alternatives to electoral democracy with universal suffrage. Electoral democracies suffer from well-known problems with widespread high levels of voter ignorance. Most voters are ignorant and irrational regarding political matters and, left unchecked, their ill-informed political preferences are converted into sub-optimal policy by accommodating representatives. Proponents of epistocracy claim that modifying our political institutions to reduce the political power of comparatively ignorant citizens (or amplify the political power of comparatively well-informed citizens) is one plausible way to ameliorate the deficiencies of democracy. In this paper, I offer a critique of the purported instrumental benefits of epistocratic arrangements on empirical grounds. I argue that proponents of epistocracy oversimplify the connection between voter policy preferences and eventual policy outcomes. More importantly, they ignore several important sources of sub-optimal policies. In addition, I argue that epistocratic reforms face difficulties in addressing voter ignorance and voter irrationality. I close by considering several amendments to epistocratic proposals that render the view both instrumentally and non-instrumentally more attractive.	Adam Gibbons	NA
2019	85651	523	Lotteries are as Legitimizing as Elections	I argue that institutions of sortition are as legitimizing as electoral democratic institutions. I consider three accounts of democratic legitimacy that have received significant attention in recent decades: i) fairness, ii) instrumentalism, and iii) participation. On the basis of any of these three values, one might raise the legitimation objection to sortition: sortition lacks the requisite value that leads to legitimacy, and so is normatively deficient as a democratic institution. In reply to the legitimation objection, I argue that sortition can realize all three conceptions of legitimacy to the same degree that electoral institutions can. The intrinsic fairness of lottery-based selection allows sortition to achieve legitimacy on the fairness conception. Recent analyses of the epistemic advantages of randomly constructed assemblies provide us with reason to believe that sortition can provide significant social benefit, answering the instrumentalism conception of the objection. Lastly, I argue that any kind of participation which is unique to electoral institutions can be translated to sortition, settling the participatory version of the legitimation objection.

2019	85694	541	Epistemic Democracy and the Wisdom of Crowds	The paper examines the modern social science research regarding the epistemic competence of large groups – the so-called ‘wisdom of crowds’ (Surowiecki, 2004) or ‘wisdom of the multitude’ (Waldron, 1995) – and the potential of sortition to harness the benefits of cognitive diversity. The paper focuses on Helene Landemore’s (2013) distinction between ‘counting’ and ‘talking’ approaches and concludes that both the conceptual arguments and genealogical evidence support the aggregative (counting) approach. This suggests that sortition will need to be combined with elite information advocacy, as large randomly-selected juries can only perform an aggregative judgment role – in line with the Aristotelian argument that whereas artists and architects are the best designers of paintings and buildings, those who look at the paintings and live in the houses are the best judges of their quality.

2019	85923	PE 2.1	Economic Threat, Misinformation, and Public Support for International Trade	The recent surge in protectionist sentiment in countries around the world has rekindled the long-standing debate over the determinants of citizens' trade policy preferences. We examine the individual and interactive effects of two understudied but increasingly relevant factors --- misinformation and economic threat --- on support for international trade in the United States. We first present survey evidence showing that more than 6--in--10 Americans endorse a salient misperception about Chinese currency manipulation despite extensive evidence to the contrary. We then report results from two preregistered survey experiments that randomized exposure to anti-trade misinformation, corrective information, and economically threatening frames. We find that neither anti-trade misinformation nor threatening rhetoric individually reduces support for international trade. However, we find that the effectiveness of corrections depends critically on the presence of absence of economically threatening rhetoric: correcting misperceptions increase support for trade, but only in the absence of threatening rhetoric. These results suggest that as long as economically threatening rhetoric is prevalent, efforts to correct anti-trade misinformation will not increase public support for trade.	D.J. Flynn	NA
2019	120942	PE 2.2	'Folk Mercantilism'? Competing Frameworks in Public Opinion on Trade	What does the public think of when thinking about international trade? This paper argues that the public relies on a particular set of heuristics to overcome informational gaps when forming trade policy views. These heuristics draw links between foreign trade and national security that would have sounded familiar to classic mercantilist pamphleteers: nation-states conducting trade in a competitive environment comprised of friends and enemies, where gains are zero-sum, exports are to be preferred to imports, and the goal of trade is national strength (and survival) through national wealth. They are appealing because they simplify a complex economic reality while drawing on recognizable concepts and emotions related to foreign policy conflict and military contests. Our empirical design combines historical cross-national survey evidence and an original survey experiment embedded in the most recent iteration of the U.S. Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). We find that reliance on these heuristics varies across countries and is more common, though not limited to, those with limited economic and political knowledge.	Katja Kleinberg	NA
2019	120944	1276	Do Electoral Campaigns Influence Public Support for Trade? Evidence from the 2016 US Presidential Election	The open-economy politics of trade presumes that elections, as a political institution, aggregate preferences of individual voters to resolve a salient trade cleavage in a democratic society. This presumption, despite being applied to analytical narratives of trade politics in the literature, has not been empirically tested. The 2016 US presidential election is unique in this regard; trade policy became a politically salient issue, and was treated as such during the electoral campaign. We exploit two waves of a nationally-representative panel survey conducted before and after the 2016 US presidential election to identify the effect of electoral campaigns on the change in public support for trade in general and trade agreements in particular. In contrast with the conventional wisdom, we find that the election and presidential campaigns not only aggregate preexisting individual preferences for trade, but also affect public support for trade. Our main result helps explain why political candidates continue to include trade as an electoral plank when campaigning. It also suggests that trade preferences of individual voters are more endogenous to domestic institutions and political dynamics than previously assumed.	Michael Plouffe	NA
2019	120946	1277	Information, Nativism, and Support for Economic Globalization	Recent elections in the US and UK highlighted a growing anti-globalization sentiment that threatens the liberal international economic system. Existing research points to economic dislocation, sociotropic judgments, and status threats to explain mass protectionist attitudes, but neglects a key factor that has been central to campaign rhetoric: nativism. With nationally representative survey data from the U.S. and UK, we first introduce a new latent measure for globalization attitudes and show that nativism predicts negative beliefs about globalization’s effects – even among people who espouse a strong free market ideology. Second, we analyze the results of a survey experiment to show that while giving people information about the long-term national benefits of free trade decreases protectionism on average, the treatment effect weakens among more nativist Americans.

2019	120948	1278	Moving Goalposts: Presidential Accountability for Economic Foreign Policy	The 2016 Presidential campaign strikingly increased discussion of trade. If Americans previously lacked information about the link between trade and economic circumstances, the information should lead to greater certainty about their preferences for trade protection and greater ability to hold politicians accountable for trade policy. Alternatively, it is possible that even with greater certainty about benefits from trade, trade preferences are not important enough for voters to hold politicians accountable. To test the impact of increased information on accountability, I fielded a survey to 1000 representative U.S. potential voters which gathered information concerning American beliefs about the benefits of trade and their preferences for trade protection. To observe respondents’ willingness to hold President Trump accountable for his trade-related campaign promises, a survey experiment varied the description of President Trump’s negotiation with China. As predicted by an information-based hypothesis, respondents were less likely to answer “don’t know' than in prior years. However, the survey showed little correlation between trade preferences and support for the President’s trade policy, suggesting that despite increased information, trade-based accountability remains low.

2019	86403	992	Tradeoffs in Attitudes towards Taxation and Spending: A Conjoint Experiment Based on the British Tax Summary	Governments who want to increase public spending in one area can pay for it by cutting spending in other areas, increasing taxation (or by borrowing). But public understanding of existing levels of taxation and expenditure is poor, making it difficult to measure views on the resulting trade-offs. We use widely-distributed UK taxpayer summaries as the baseline for a conjoint experiment assessing these trade-offs in the public mind. We make two innovations in this paper. On the substantive side, we vary both changes in spending across different areas of the budget and overall changes to the tax bill. This allows us to investigate trade-offs not only between spending in different policy areas, but also between spending increases (decreases) and tax hikes (cuts). Methodologically, our approach differs from conventional conjoint experiments in using continuous rather than categorical treatments. Rather than pre-defining a limited number of tax and spending changes, the changes we present are random draws from continuous probability distributions over a range of internally consistent trade-offs. This allows for us to estimate public support for various budget profiles with greater flexibility.	Lucy Barnes, Jack Blumenau	NA
2019	86075	745	Electoral policy-making with constraints: Partisan political budget cycles in industrialised democracies	Politicians want to win elections and, for this reason, governments in democratic countries have strong incentives to implement policies that maximize their political support in the short run even at the expense of long-term costs. One strategy incumbents can employ to improve the likelihood to get reelected is to distort fiscal policy. A partisan political budget cycle occurs when incumbents increase the provision of public goods to their likely supporters before elections (financed either through higher deficits or increased taxes). At the same time, if voters are fiscally conservative, they prefer governments who improve their economic welfare without increasing debt or the taxes. In this paper, we propose that, when facing institutional and structural constraints, governments do engage in what we call “partisan political budget cycles.” Using OECD National Accounts data, we show that when constraints are high (1) government partisan differences do not affect aggregate spending or deficits, but, more importantly (2) they do affect the composition of budgets in a partisan way.

2019	78077	69	The Demise of the 'Death Tax': The Worldwide Abolition of InheritanceTaxation, 1970-2015	The modern tax state is a global phenomenon. Most countries in the worldhave introduced a handful of core taxes at some point in time. Moreover, the taxstate is sticky: once in place, modern taxes are here to stay. Yet there is oneexception to the rule; taxes on inheritances are vanishing rapidly across the globe.Since the inheritance tax is an effective redistributive tool in times of rocketingwealth inequality, its global demise becomes even more surprising. Why do countriesabolish the inheritance tax? Most studies so far focus on advanced democracies andidentify dysfunctional democratic institutions as drivers of inheritance tax repeal.We expand these studies both in scope and aim by analysing a novel data set on taxlegislation worldwide with event history models. The results show that inheritancetax repeal is a global trend, which affects democracies and autocracies alike. Whileglobalization has facilitated its demise, historical legacies can prolong the life of theinheritance tax.	Laura Seelkopf	NA
2019	86481	1054	Changing Politics and Changing Pies: The Political Economy of Budgets in Developing Countries	Researchers have tended to compartmentalize the various parts of budgets: e.g., spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. This has led to some confusion about how politics influences budgetary behaviour, since governments can take a more holistic approach to their decision making. Here, we theorize about how governments trade-off the various budgetary components under more restrictive situations by focusing on developing countries. By considering spending, revenue, and year on year changes in debt in a compositional framework, we argue that this will highlight the various manoeuvrings that governments undertake that go beyond shifts in just one part of the budget.

2019	81307	119	Explaining fiscal worlds. How the EU countries balanced income equality and national wealth between 2007 and 2016.	The paper develops an original framework in which fiscal policy mixes shape four 'fiscal worlds' characterized by a special balance between income equality and national wealth. A fiscal policy mix biased toward regulation generates an uneven/well-off fiscal world and motivates low-income groups to mobilize for redistribution. If narrow-sighted policymakers react by implementing redistributive policies for short-term consumption, national economy moves toward the even/badly-off fiscal world. If policymakers react through distributive policies, economic downturn matches with higher income inequality, leading to the uneven/badly-off fiscal world. Only one fiscal world positively combines income equality and national wealth and asks farsighted policymakers to adopt redistributive policies for investments. This framework is tested through a mixed method approach (QCA and mainstream econometrics). We map EU countries' membership to the four fiscal worlds over the last decade by developing a new set-theoretic indicator. Then, we identify the conjunctions of fiscal policy tools (taxation, spending and regulation) that explain countries' membership to a given fiscal world and the role played by economic strain and political disaffection in explaining countries' shifts.
